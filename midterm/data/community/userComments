When you think of a college institution as a kind of company or industry (you pay money, tuition; they offer a service, education), then it makes sense. Every employee handbook that I've read has a section asserting that disrespect, harassment or discrimination in the workplace can lead to termination and/or severe consequences. The same goes for colleges and universities. Harassment and discrimination (which makes up the foundation of Title IX) should lead to some form of review process to see whether or not the respondent (\"accused,\" if you will) deserves to stay in that particular institution.<br/> Subsequently, if the reporting party chooses to press criminal charges before, during or after the review process at the university, then they can do that as well. Sexual assault can result in trauma, fear and even feelings of humiliation and isolation that make it difficult to process the incident. Thus, they might avoid calling local police.<br/>For this reason, I don't see the university system as a replacement of the justice system at all. I see it as a process, one that is adopted by most American institutions anyways, to review the incident and make a decision based on the evidence provided. Essentially, it serves to determine whether or not an individual violated the \"company rules\" and what sanctions should be given out, whether that means remedial therapy, suspension or expulsion.

Sincere question--I don't know the answer.  <br/><br/>One might analogize colleges to workplaces, like a ship or oil rig, where employees live as well as work.

No judicial case is simple. Even civil cases are complicated, so it is fair to say that there is no perfect way to adjudicate sexual assault without running into obstacles.

Yet those activities are sponsored and funded by the college so I guess it does actually count as \"work hours.\" <br/><br/>The off-campus situation is a tricky one. Generally the campus police is called first at those locations if the incident is reported immediately. This allows the student to get a PERK kit done right away as well, which provides incontrovertible evidence that a rape occurred. The police then have to follow through with a criminal investigation if the reporting party wishes to press charges.

The economy is in transition:  white collar workers have adapted as their jobs became knowledge work, but routine jobs are not a transition to knowledge work.

Real wages (nominal minus inflation) are barely up 1%, the gains skewed to upper incomes, aided by oil price induced low inflation still rippling through economy, and DNWR which coasts well above 0% for most workers. <br/><br/><a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/web/jolts/jlt_labstatgraphs.pdf\" title=\"https://www.bls.gov/web/jolts/jlt_labstatgraphs.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.bls.gov/web/jolts/jlt_labstatgraphs.pdf</a><br/><a href=\"http://cepr.net/blogs/cepr-blog/we-need-more-quitters\" title=\"http://cepr.net/blogs/cepr-blog/we-need-more-quitters\" target=\"_blank\">http://cepr.net/blogs/cepr-blog/we-need-more-quitters</a><br/><br/>We are five years away from full employment, at least.", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "createDate": "1483947946", "updateDate": "1483947966", "approveDate": "1483947966", "userID": 49343485, "userDisplayName": "C", "userTitle": "NULL", "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "New York, N.Y.", "editorsSelection": 0, "recommendationCount": 5, "replyCount": 1, "assetID": 3464011, "assetURL": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2017/01/07/the-shock-of-the-normal/", "status": "approved", "commentType": "comment", "replies": {"comments": [{"commentID": 21043140, "status": "approved", "commentSequence": 21043140, "userID": 66568899, "userDisplayName": "Spengler", "userLocation": "Ohio", "userTitle": "NULL", "userURL": "NULL", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "commentBody": "I can't believe people \"rec'd\" this.

            "commentBody":"I'm so tired of Trump using the \"audit excuse\" as his rationale for not releasing his tax returns for public inspection.  First off, we have nothing apart from his accountant's statement to confirm that any of his returns are being audited by the IRS. Secondly, assuming that they ARE being audited, this surely doesn't involve his entire history of tax filing...? Why not release the rest of his returns?  And how long has this process been going on now?  Months? Years?  Decades?  Third, even if they are being audited (all of them!), he is under no legal obligation to withhold them from pubic review.  None.  And anyone who believes that our new kitty-grabber-in-chief has nothing to hide with respect to business dealings with Russia (among other less-than-friendly states), non-payment of federal income tax, paltry contributions to charity and/or the claiming of dependents other than his wife and the one minor child we're presently aware of is remarkably credulous.  At the same time, anyone who suspects that something may be up with this imaginary object of Putin's admiration but simply doesn't much care will be waiting almost as long for jobs to return to the Rust Belt as for Jesus to reappear in Jerusalem.

Suddenly allowing 18 year olds to purchase alcohol does no good in emphasising the importance of knowing one's limits, since it creates an atmosphere where drinking is viewed as being a coming of age rite (and thus the number of young adults who end up vomiting curbside at 2am). Rather, countries should adopt the German policy of allowing 16 year olds to purchase drinks with low alcohol content and hard liquors at 18. This might be more effective in teaching them the importance of knowing their limits and that there is nothing especially 'cool' about drinking culture. ",

The way to do it is to allow ad hoc groups to get insurance, and to allow those groups to have insurance across state lines. <br/><br/>I own a business with 25 employees spread over 5 states. Getting health insurance in multiple states is hard and expensive. If we could get insurance through our industry trade group, we would be part of a 10,000 person pool, we'd get much better insurance at better prices. But, today, that's illegal. Only unions can have insurance across state lines. <br/><br/>Besides an industry trade group, what if an individual could get that health insurance as part of being members of a club, a church, an association, or AARP?  Now, you have some negotiating power.  Insurance companies would be courting every organization for business.  Anyone can join. Its a win-win",

It is not surprising the overwhelming black vote Hillary got- she constantly pandered to blacks while excluded 87% of America.  She trotted around with Michael Brown's mother and a dozen other black women who'd lost children to gun violence by whites.  2% of all violence in white on black.  70% of all interracial violence has a black perpetrator.  But she chose to exclude the mother's who were not black and whose killer wasn't white.  Not one of these deaths were any more tragic then gun violence that happens everyday, and in several cases (such as Brown) the culpability rests solely with the criminal actions of the deceased person.  Why does the mother of a black male who robbed then brutually assaulted an elderly Asian clerk then tried to kill a cop get put on a pedestal?  It's offensive and racist.  If Brown were Asian and that store clerk a Somalian immigrant his mom would not be touted by the Democrats.<br/>Blacks seem to think the fact that most blacks voted for Hillary means they used better judgement.  No, they voted for who catered to their unreasonable demands 24/7.  If it had been Trump they would have voted Trump.",

Is the documented information regarding Donald Trump such that we need to recklessly pile on innuendo and hearsay in the days leading up to his inauguration because the public needs to know while we still have time?   If we agree that these are real questions that need answers then it should be verified information leading to questions of then president Trump.   However if this is a thinly veiled attempt to nullify or make illegitimate a democratically held election in our country than we are in danger of the boy who cried wolf trap.   What if a more concerted effort was put in place to subvert our democracy?  Who could you believe after this tabloid like chasing of anything negative regarding Trump.  Standards for journalism exist for a reason and it's sad to see them thrown away for a short sighted hissyfit over an election between 2 candidates that had real flaws.

I wish Mr. Obama had discussed this more often.<br/><br/>Automation and its opportunities and negatives have been around a long time.  I got into this topic in the 80s during the Reagan double-dip recessions.  It was a pretty rough time for the economy and those who were in policy jobs were searching for pathway solutions.  I met with Wassily Leontief, whose name came to my attention through his article in Scientific American on the distribution of incomes and jobs.  It was a well researched article and bottom line he suggested that as automation soaked up traditional jobs, it would be a good idea to cut the work week and free workers for more leisure activities &amp; to pursue personal entrepreneurial activities.  He showed me in his input-output tables that this change, if managed properly, would improve the distribution of incomes &amp; jobs &amp; create more pleasure.<br/><br/>2nd thought: Electricity is fundamental to automation and eventually because of population growth, finite limits to fossil fuels including the challenges of global warming that eventually we will need to build a system of space solar satellites to beam power to Earth grids.  My colleague, Dr, James Powell, has authored a book, \"Silent Earth\", that describes this space solar satellite system that will deliver very cheap electric power to all of the Earth's people to power our needs for a modern standard of living.

The Independent claims that Steele was so alarmed by this that after the election he was working for free, desperately trying to alert the other intelligence agencies to the danger.

For example, it warns about Carter Page's involvement with the Russians, an issue that became known publicly only several months later. (Note that Trump at his most recent press conference denied even knowing Page, one of his senior advisers on Russia. Why?)

I'm sure a lot of other solvers had a similar experience.<br/><br/>Also, Deb, a quibble, though with the dictionaries not you. To say that YAW \"means to move back and forth along a flight path\" is faulty in several ways. First, \"back and forth,\" without some indicator of the direction of such movement, could as easily mean backward and forward, instead of side to side, its actual meaning. Second, YAWing is not limited to flight; a boat can also yaw in, and probably under, water. Also, planes landing in a stiff lateral wind may deliberately yaw after touching down to maintain a straight course on the runway.

The crossword clue, as usual, I feel was accurate and fair. Yawing may entail a regular or reciprocal variation around central point, but it doesn\u2019t have to. It\u2019s simply a deviation or movement about the defined vertical axis of an object. This is frequently thought of as \"left or right\" (hence \"side to side\" incorrectly implying ocillation), not usually back and forth.<br/><br/>The yaw axis is perpendicular to the wings on an airplane (or the deck of a boat). The amount of yaw is the amount rotation of the nose of the object around this axis. A boat will yaw into a cross current (also known as \u201ccrabbing\u201d) to maintain a heading. An airplane will crab into the wind to maintain a heading as well. Based on the strength and direction of the wind, the nose of the aircraft will be at some angle off the intended heading while the path over the ground will be - if done correctly - the desired heading. Since wind that happens to be blowing at any given time may not be aligned with runway, aircraft have to crab into the wind on final to stay aligned with the runway centerline; pilots reduce yaw to zero upon touchdown since the friction of the tires resists any yawing force from the wind. If bored sometime, try searching \u201ccross wind landings\u201d on Youtube. Seeing the amount of crab required in high cross wind landings can be exciting.

It does not matter if there is an actual single payer or many buyers (or payers) whose prices are set by the government or by insurance companies in collusion with each other.

The US Gov't is messing with social media accounts, and many people will find themselves connected to an account to which they were not previously connected. For example, if someone were a Twitter \"follower\" of @realdonaldtrump, that user will now find herself following \"@POTUS\" as well [unless she searches through her \"followed\" accounts and deletes the one she wishes not to follow]. If someone else had been following \"@POTUS\" during the Obama Administration, he will now find himself following \"@POTUS44\" (one of Barack Obama's newly-assigned Twitter accounts); but he will still be following \"@POTUS\", which will no longer transmit Obama Tweets. There are endless permutations involving Facebook and other services, as well as FLOTUS, VP, VPOTUS, and similar accounts. \"Likes\", \"follows\", &amp; similar connections will supposedly be generated.<br/><br/>So I'm just advising: People should check their social media accounts.", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "createDate": "1484979845", "updateDate": "1484979908", "approveDate": "1484979908", "userID": 26424636, "userDisplayName": "MTF Tobin", "userTitle": "NULL", "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "Manhattanville", "editorsSelection": 0, "recommendationCount": 0, "replyCount": 2, "assetID": 3464534, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/20/crosswords/how-ya-holding-up-macedonia-kavafian-zapotec.html", "status": "approved", "commentType": "comment", "replies": {"comments": [{"commentID": 21170902, "status": "approved", "commentSequence": 21170902, "userID": 39601591, "userDisplayName": "Kiki Rijkstra", "userLocation": "Arizona", "userTitle": "NULL", "userURL": "NULL", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "commentBody": "It happened when the Chargers moved from San Diego to Los Angeles--even to some Facebook pages that were not official.

China is rising because America handed over to China its best technology, and because America finances China's rise by allowing China to run a trade surplus against the US.

You're correct that many universities who never place their students in jobs do exploit them for their cheap labor.

The remaining 90 percent must make their way in industry, an area where supervisor's lack of expertise is magnitudes higher. The potential for new hires to skate by with impressive sounding credentials, or for those seeking promotion or junkets based on easy-to-attend conferences is that much easier. This was under-reported in the article and magnified by so many professors saying \"not at my school\" with indignant tones.<br/><br/>Academic ivory towers benefit by skimming the creamiest of the crop, but they are also the most well-positioned authorities to become arbiters of which journals and conferences are legitimate. Without their exercise of this responsibility, entire disciplines risk becoming marginalized. The result that science is accused of being nothing more than another lobby, seeking its place at the trough--where there is no truth, just special interests--is not shocking.<br/><br/>It is unfortunate that many of the tenured select say it's not a problem for real institutions or legitimate professors! It is this ostrich-in-the-sand attitude that lets our most respected representatives make the other 90% of doctoral students feel left in the breeze upon graduation with historically poor job prospects.", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "createDate": "1483429075", "updateDate": "1483429085", "approveDate": "1483429085", "userID": 71998698, "userDisplayName": "KT", "userTitle": "NULL", "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "Rockville, MD", "editorsSelection": 0, "recommendationCount": 17, "replyCount": 0, "assetID": 3463634, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/29/upshot/fake-academe-looking-much-like-the-real-thing.html", "status": "approved", "commentType": "comment", "replies": []}, {"commentID": 20969809, "parentID": 20969142, "statusID": 2, "lft": 7, "rgt": 8, "commentSequence": 20969809, "commentBody": "No mandate when the GOP rammed through new voter restriction laws that gave them control of 70 percent of the electoral college votes.
