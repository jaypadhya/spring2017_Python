308,"Step one was delegitimizing traditional media by calling it mainstream media and claiming that it was all politically biased against the right.<br/><br/>Step two was claiming that traditional media is nothing but a pack of lies.<br/><br/>Step three is proclaiming that we are now officially in post truth America where convincing the listener is all that matters.<br/><br/>Step four was using all three above to get an incompetent demagogue elected to the Presidency.<br/><br/>Step four was for the demagogue to appoint an extremist fanatic as his chief law enforcement officer (AG) solely because of his unyielding support.  <br/><br/>Step five is for the new AG to circumvent the laws he is will soon be sworn to uphold in order to secure his appointment.<br/><br/>Step five is for the new AG to do whatever the demagogue wants in order to further his political agenda which is primarily concerned with installing a permanent oligarchy to rule America.<br/><br/>Step six is selling out America to big money and ultra-nationalists, all in the name of God, glory and the flag.<br/><br/>Step seven is the end of liberty, the establishment of tyranny and the debasement of our cherished political system, which we used to call democracy.<br/><br/>That my friends is a seven step program designed to turn America into an monied aristocracy instead of a nation of laws.<br/><br/>None of this happened by accident.

Breitbart, as always, has turned this backwards.<br/><br/>""For 30 years I have viewed the prosecution of the Perry County Three as a cautionary tale. I believe it demonstrates what can happen when prosecutorial discretion is unchecked, when regard for facts is secondary to political objectives. What can happen is that the rule of law is imperiled.

It's his first name that is more relevant in making him proud as a champion of white supremacy.

15,"The New York Times needs to take a page from more serious reporting. Occasionally they do real reporting, but day after day we can reliably count on opinionating rather than informing. For example, we are looking at history-making floods in California, but where is that news? All over the globe, extreme weather is providing daily evidence of change. This accumulating information is something everyone needs to know. Denial of climate science and global warming/climate change would not be so easy if reporting followed its duty to tell the story.<br/><br/>In the end, the planet is more powerful than the mountebank and his kleptocracy, and their eagerness to shut down science and silence their critics. Being ""fair"" to this does not serve us well.<br/><br/>This guy doesn't need to be ""figured out"", it's all too obvious what he's up to. The New York Times should not play patsy to this.<br/><br/>""Mr. Trump has great gifts in the art of vengeance and humiliation. It is a ribald form of wit that can make voters laugh with the scornful jeer that, for a moment, irons out the inequalities between the 1 percent and the rest of the nation.
