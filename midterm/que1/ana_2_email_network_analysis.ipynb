You\\nsay that your panel costs are $20,000 additional. that sounds like a lot. I\\njust did a panel house with a 2100 sq ft footprint and the total panel cost\\nwas about $25,000 with 8 inch walls and 10 inch roof. Stay in touch and we\\ncan discuss alternatives if that becomes necessary.

I am planning to build a home in San Marcos as soon as I can\\ndecide on a builder and materials.  I already have my blueprints\\ncompleted.  What I took from our conversation  was to use the SIP\\'s with\\n8.5\" roof panels and use a metal roof.\\n\\nI have been working with Johnnie Brown, a builder from San Antonio that\\nis also a Creative Panel rep.  The problem is that I have a budget of\\n$85-$90/sf and it does not appear that he will be able to stay within\\nthat budget.  I don\\'t want to settle for a conventional stick built\\nhouse.  I was wondering about alternatives.  Would some combination of a\\nradiant barrier and non-CFC spray insulation provide close to the same\\nenergy savings at a lower cost than SIP\\'s. For example, I just spoke to\\na sales rep for Demilec.  He will spray foam insulation at $1.30/sf.\\nThat would be approximately $10,000 compared to over $20,000 additional\\ncosts for the panels.  But would the foam insulation be as effective?\\nDo you have any suggestions of materials or contractors that would help\\nme construct the best home for the money.  I am trying to get a bid from\\nWink with Premier based on you reference.\\n\\nThank you for your help.\\n\\nPhillip Allen\\npallen@enron.com\\n713-853-7041\\n\\n\\n**********************************************************************\\nThis e-mail is the property of Enron Corp. and/or its relevant affiliate and\\nmay contain confidential and privileged material for the sole use of the\\nintended recipient (s).

The way the tax law works, the tax basis for your share distribution will be based on the closing stock price the day preceding notification to the transfer agent.  As such, we will distribute net shares calculating the proper withholding at fair market value the day prior to notifying the transfer agent.  We will be distributing the shares reflected on your 9/30/01 statement (6,606 shares plus cash for fractional shares).  If you would prefer to settle the taxes with a personal check, we can distribute gross shares.  Please let me know you preference.\\n\\nAs you know, we are in the process of transferring recordkeeping services from NTRC to Hewitt.  As such, we have a CPA, Larry Lewis, working with us to audit and set up transition files.

       " 'Michelle\\nHere are my very minor comments. However we still need to wait on any additions, based on meeting with SME\\'s today. One concern is the firing of the learner who performs  bad in the final two scenarios. Do we face any copyright issues using the CNN type themes? In addition, I think we need to stay clear of anything that remotely seems like California or anything that really happen with Enron? (i.e. So-cal Waha) In addition, comments on regulatory issues may be a problem (i.e. California Legislature).\\n\\nSheri\\n\\nWhen you read all the scripts together and due to the similar mechanics being taught it appears very repetitious. Thus I do believe we need to maybe use a \"Dateline\" type theme for one, and a \"60 Minute\" type theme for another scenario vice just the CNN type theme.

This provision is stated to be notwithstanding any other provision =\\nof the plan.  It also states that the account balance shall be determined a=\\ns of the last day of the month preceding the date on which the committee re=\\nceives the written request of the participant.  In my case this would be as=\\n of September 30th.  I read this paragraph to indicate a cash payout of 90%=\\n of the value of all deferrals as on September 30, 2001.  The plan administ=\\nrators, however, interpret this paragraph differently.  Their reading yield=\\ns a cash payout of 90% of the value for deferrals other than the Phantom St=\\nock Account, which they believe should be paid with 90% of  Enron Corp. sha=\\nres in the account as of September 30, 2001.  Their justification is that i=\\nn several places throughout the plan document and brochures it is stated th=\\nat the distributions of the Phantom Stock Account shall be made in shares o=\\nf Enron Corp. common stock.\\n\\nThere are two reason that I do not agree with their interpretation.  First,=\\n  section 6.3 begins with \"notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan.=\\n\"  This indicates that any other payout methodologies described in other se=\\nctions of the plan which deal with normal distribution at termination do no=\\nt apply.  Second, the language in section 6.3 stating \"a single sum distrib=\\nution of all of the Participant\\'s deferral accounts\" indicates that one pay=\\nment will be made not a cash payment separate from a share distribution.\\n\\nThe interpretation of the administrators goes beyond section 6.3.  If that =\\nis the case then section 7.1 should apply.  This section does provide for t=\\nhe Phantom Stock Account to be paid in shares.  However, it states \"The val=\\nue of the shares, and resulting payment amount, will be based on the closin=\\ng price of Enron Corp. common stock on the January 1 before the date of pay=\\nment, and such payment shall be made in shares of Enron Corp common stock\".=\\n  This would result in approximately 8.3 shares to be distributed for every=\\n share in the account on January 1, 2001.  Although this would be the most =\\nbeneficial to the participants due to the decline of the value of Enron Cor=\\np. common stock from $83 to $10 per share,  this methodology goes beyond se=\\nction 6.3.\\n\\nThe calculations below illustrate the difference in the value and method of=\\n distribution under each of the three interpretations:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSection 6.3=09=09Plan Administrators=09=09Section 7.1\\n\\nNumber of shares=09=096,600=09shares=09=096,600=09shares=09=09=096,600 shar=\\nes\\nRelative share price=09=09$27.23=09=09=09=09=09=09=09$83.13\\nPhantom Stock Value=09=09$179,718=09=09=09=09=09=09$548,658\\n10% Penalty=09=09=09-17,972=09=09=09 -600=09=09=09=09-54,866\\nValue to be distributed=09=09$161,746=09=096,000 shares=09=09=09$493,792\\nCurrent stock price=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09$10\\nDistribution=09=09=09$161,746=09=096,000 shares=09=09=0949,379 shares\\n\\nI believe my interpretation under section 6.3 is correct and fair.  If the =\\nadministrators insist on distributing shares instead of cash then section 7=\\n.1 should apply.  The current interpretation of the plan administrators is =\\na hybrid between the two sections resulting in the lowest possible payout. =\\n =20\\n\\nIn addition to myself, Tom Martin, Scott Neal, and Don Black are facing the=\\n same issue.  I would appreciate your review and consideration of this matt=\\ner.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\n\\nPhillip Allen   =20\\n=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09',\n",

       " 'For purposes of an accelerated distribution from the PSA,  a \"single sum distribution,\" in Section 6.2 means that a PSA account is distributed all at once, as distinguished from another form of payout as may have been selected by a participant in his or her deferral agreement.  \\n\\nSection 6.2 is clear in that the account balance shall be determined as of the last day of the month preceding the date on which the Committee receives the written request of the Participant.  A PSA account balance is reflected in shares of stock since the form of distribution is shares of stock.\\n\\nAdditionally, any portion of a PSA balance attributable to deferral of restricted stock is administered under Sections 3.5 and 3.6 and Exhibit A of the Plan. This section is applicable now as we are accelerating the distribution of PSA balances created with deferrals of restricted stock.  The Plan indicates that upon death, disability, retirement or termination, the share units are converted to shares which are issued to the executive according to the payment election made by the executive at the time of the deferral election.  \\n\\n      Therefore the distribution you will receive in shares is correct and we do not agree with your interpretation of the plan.\\n',\n",

       " 'To all of our esteemed & prized Internet Banking  (IBS) Clients:\\n\\nYou probably have begun to wonder does anyone ever return phone calls\\n(or e-mails). We really do but have been holed up trying to complete\\nthis project ASAP. We knew that this might upset some clients, but we\\nfound that this is the quickest way to fix this problem and get our\\nusers back on-line.\\n\\nWe have finalized the movement of your customer account #s and re-linked\\nyour additional accounts back to your primary Login ID (Acct #). This\\nprocess was more daunting than we anticipated and having to verify 1100\\nIBS users and account #s (to insure your data integrity and\\nconfidentiality) was even more grueling than expected. After verifying\\ndata and Login IDs, we believe that we are on the right track. Some of\\nyou (our IBS clients) might notice your accounts displayed more than\\nonce or additional accounts displayed that you may (or may not) want\\ndisplayed on your IBS screen. Should this be the case, please e-mail (or\\nphone) the information to us and we will remove this information right\\naway.\\n\\nTo our IBS Billpayer clients:\\n\\nDuring this process, we seem to have misplaced (blown away) your bill\\npayment information (particularly anyone that has [had] reoccurring\\npayments scheduled to process on particular days). This has become our\\nhighest priority to retrieve this information, thus alleviating the\\nprocess of having to request that our IBS Billpayers re-enter this\\ninformation. We are going to waive all bill payment charges for the\\nmonths of November & December, 2001 to try and regain your confidence\\n(and support).\\n\\nAgain, we deeply express our regrets and hope that we (yourselves and\\nourselves) do not have to go through this process again. Should you be\\none of our IBS clients that still has not gained access to your account\\ninformation, please refer to the following information:\\n\\n1)  You have entered your password incorrectly (or what you thought was\\nthe correct password) and been given the error message \"You have failed\\nto correctly login three times today; please try again tomorrow, or\\ncontact the bank at 830-379-5236 to have your password reset.\" This is\\nthe easiest problem to correct and we can fix this one quickly with you\\nonline (on the phone or by e-mail [our preferred method]). Should you\\nreceive this message, please call our Computer Department and ask for\\neither myself (Howard Gordon) @ 830-401-1185, Christina Kirby @\\n830-401-1189, or Lora Robles @ 830-401-1182. If you reach our voice mail\\n(or another employee), please leave your Name, Account # and call back\\n#.\\n\\n2)  You are not using the last six (6) digits of your ssn# (this is the\\nssn# or tin# of the primary account holder). Please try again using the\\nlast six (6) digits, or call us to determine who we have recorded as the\\nprimary account holder. Since we have released these accounts for IBS\\naccess, you will have to again use the last six (6) digits of your ssn#\\n(this is the ssn# or tin# of the primary account holder), then you will\\nbe directed to a screen that asks for information such as:\\n\\nName\\nAddress\\nCity, State Zip+4\\nPhone #\\nE-Mail Address\\n\\nAfter entering this information and clicking submit, you will then be\\ninstructed to change your password to anything that you desire (you can\\nat this point change your password back to what it was before).  Always\\nremember that your password is case sensitive.\\n\\nAgain we want to thank you for your patience through this (trying)\\nordeal, and we look forward to serving your IBS needs in the future.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\nHoward Gordon\\nNetwork Manager\\n\\n - geninfo.vcf ',\n",
