<html><head><h3>Red Roof Inn Las Vegas Hotel Reviews Page 3</h3></head><body><br>Average room<p>We pulled in on our way through Vegas. We didn't plan on staying long. Room was average, a bit outdated. Breakfast was free, but really lacking a bit of variety. Not that I have high expectations for free breakfast, but it could have had a bit more. Pool was a definite highlight, very refreshing!</p><br>Excellent value for money<p>As travellers on a budget, Red Roof Inn is perfect. Good location (bit of a walk to strip but find in a taxi!) and spacious, air conditioned rooms. We loved the 'motel' feel and really enjoyed our stay. Spent some time by the pool which, although not immaculate, was great relief from the heat and was nice and quiet. Didn't sample breakfast due to several very early starts. Would highly recommend!</p><br>Nice rooms with lot of airplane noise.<p>Stayed here for 2 nights. Location is good, near everything without the crazy crowds of the strip. Room was large and clean with a nice firm king bed. But the noise of the landing planes was irritating. We were on the 2nd floor directly below the flight path of planes landing at the Las Vegas airport. The breakfast was minimimal - for this kind of hotel thy should have more to offer. The breakfast room is also very small but with nothing much to eat, nobody stays there for long - one look at what they have and most of the guest think of going to a McD.</p><br>was different look for a red roof. excellent<p>the layout was unlike any other red roof. had separate buildings. a small pool that was decent. Widows that open. a normal continental breakfast, cereals and bread. Only bad thing is the jets are quite loud on takeoff. at least I got my 600am wakeup. the staff an cleanliness was top notch. next to hard rock casino if you want to lose money. this place is worth the cost though. also a fridge, nuker and sink
Room Tip: said noise was high because of the planes. im a light sleeper

The hotel location is quiet and safe while close to all the great Vegas attractions. The hotel layout allows drivers to pull right up to the room, this is amazingly convenient. The Deluxe King Suite was surprisingly spacious and came loaded with a full compliment of amenities. The hotel staff were friendly and professional at all times.

Kayla and Leslie at the front desk handled every detail perfectly and were actually a joy to work with. As a business traveler, this level of service is greatly appreciated.

See you next time Red Roof Las Vegas.</p><br>Great location despite being off strip<p>The hotel isn't located ON the Vegas Strip but it's an easy walk and there's tons of things nearby. Hard rock cafe and some bars and restaurants. The hotel room is pretty basic. Despite the nonsmoking label on the room people had most definitely smoked in it. So that wasn't the best smell.... The breakfast was nice for being free. Bagels, Danishes, apples, oranges and some make it yourself oatmeal, enough to get you going for the day. Room was cleaned daily. And I thought the bed was really comfortable. I would stay here again</p><br>Did not meet expectations<p>We stayed for 1 night at this location. I was disappointed with the cleanliness of the room. In the morning, I reported this to the front desk. The room is small. The parking was convenient. I would choose a different motel.</p><br>Two Blocks Off The Vegas Strip<p>Our flight was cancelled late in the evening and we needed to find a place to stay. There were two very large conventions in Vegas and we were attempting to book a room around midnight---both conditions made securing a room a challenge. However, the Red Roof Inn was able to book us for 2 nights (that night and a additional night because our next flight out of LA was going to be at 11:30 p.m. the following day and we needed the room during the day.)
The doors to the rooms are outside and car parking is available right in front of your door. Our room was basic. The bathroom tile wasn't very clean but there were plenty of towels. Again, the room was adequate---very basic.
The pool is small but appears to be well maintained. It is located behind the main building in the parking area.
The office did not have a working printer (computer and printer had a sign "Out Of Order" on them) for us to print out our airline boarding passes when they arrived via email.
The design of this hotel is nice and as you walk the property it appears to be very well maintained on the exterior.
This hotel worked for us in a stressful situation. This was fine for our stay while waiting for our flight but probably wouldn't be a place that I would recommend for vacationing families.
Room Tip: Ask for pool towels in the lobby to have them available in your room.

Hotel is 10 minute drive to the Strip, casinos, & most major tourist attractions. Close to fast food,especially "In N' Out . Downtown Vegas is very bad, half the buildings are closed down and fenced off. It was much safer to spend the extra 20$ and stay in a well known hotel chain in a safe area like this Red Roof. It was cheaper than the casinos (about 40$/ night). everything in Vegas is expenisive for tourists, though,so thats fair. It's half the price of casink hitems that chare extra resort fees on top of $100/room or more. Downtown las vegas has some cheap motels and hostels but it looks like a ghost town..half the mktels are closed down or the whole building is fenced in. Downtown is very bad & dangerous..don't be fooeled by the $20 motels & hostels. Pay thr extra $ to stay at a well known hotel chain in a safe, well- lit, business area like Red Roof Inn. I recommend this hotel to people looking for a cheap,quiet, clean hotel, especially familes...just remember it's NOT a resort. If you want a resort stay at one.</p><br>Avoid<p>We chose the Red Roof Inn for a weekend trip to Las Vegas. Unfortunately, everything started with a pretty unfriendly welcome. The staff seemed to be stressed out. When we had some questions the lady even rolled there eyes in front of us. If you do not pay in advance be ready for an additional energy charge which was luckily not applied for us. It was no problem to find parking nearby the room as the parking lot is pretty big and provides enough space. We could get connected to the complementary WiFi which had drop outs all the time and did barely work. In the room we found a kitchen, but there were no kitchenware, so you basically can not use it if you did not bring your own. There was no safe inside the room. In the evening there was no warm water in the shower. During the night it got pretty loud. It seems there are a lot of crickets out. Another reason is that the airport is fairly near, so you can definitely use some ear plugs. During the next day our room did to receive house keeping service. At the lobby we figured out that our room was not the only room that did not get service. The house keeping staff was already gone. However, they offered a special house keeping service for an additional charge of 26 dollar + tip. The hotel provides a fairly small fitness room and complementary breakfast.
It is a 15 min drive or a 30 min walk to the strip. I really cannot recommend this hotel and would never stay there again.</p><br></body></html>
