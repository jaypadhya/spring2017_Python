<html><head><h3>Red Roof Inn Las Vegas Hotel Reviews Page 10</h3></head><body><br>Superior Value, Excellent Service<p>I came to Las Vegas for a convention, and the strip hotels were too expensive and the crowds and traffic are excessive there, so I started looking elsewhere. This property is close enough to the Convention Center and the strip and really close to UNLV, one of the places I had to visit. Walking to any of them in the summer heat isn't really practical, but cabs are abundant and fares only $10-15 to go to those places. The hotel has clean well equipped rooms, free wifi, and pleasant, helpful staff. The room furnishings are a little dated and there's no flat screen tv, but at $49.95 one can hardly complain. The free continental breakfast is very basic: danish or plain bagels, instant plain oatmeal, juices (the OJ was very good--not watered down as at many places) and apples and oranges for fresh fruit. I wish there had been a couple of cold cereal choices, maybe some flavored instant oatmeal, and some yogurt, but again at this price it's fine as is. There's a Hard Rock Cafe across the street too. I consider this one of the best values in Las Vegas.</p><br>Very comfortable<p>I had three HORRIBLE nights at the Excalibur Hotel... Based on a friends recommendation, I tried the Red Roof Inn on my last night in Vegas. It was newly renovated and I was much more comfortable in the Red Roof than in the Excalibur Hotel. I will consider staying here again.....The rooms close to the road are a bit noisy.
Room Tip: Rooms close to the road are noisy from the road traffic.

The Red Roof Inn was a nice place to stay at a reasonable price, and we could park right in front of the room. No walking across a hot parking lot and thru a crowd, smoke filled casino to get to a room. there are plenty of casinos close by if you want to visit them.</p><br>A gem<p>The staff is amazing....the front desk, security, housekeeping. Just super! If we made a request it was fulfilled very quickly and with supreme customer service. Our room was clean, walking distance to good food and fun, and the pool was well taken care of. Breakfast wasn't anything special, but people....it's FREE. We were treated like family, which is really nice when you're road weary. The clientele was a little sketchy on occasion, but nothing that made us feel unsafe. Thank you Red Roof staff for taking such excellent care of us! --The Graces</p><br>Paradise Road/City Inn<p>On booking the Red Roof I knew only that it was near to where I was going- the joint at the Hard Rock, and it certainly delivered there. It was nearer to the venue than many rooms in the actual Hard Rock hotel.

Check in was a breeze and very welcoming unlike when I've stayed in a major resort on the strip. My room was in building 2 and was great. King size bed, fridge, cooker, TV and very powerful shower & bath. It was very spacious and air con worked well. The pool was small but relaxing and quiet (apart from planes).

You've got all the amenities at the hard rock at your disposal and a food court (mall) next door. I strongly recommend Ferraros Italian. Best meal I had in Vegas.

Added bonus was free Wi-Fi (worked very well) and complimentary breakfast. Wi-Fi costs a similar price to a room at Red Roof at strip hotels.

Enjoyed walk to the strip. Probably takes 10mins.

Staffs throughout hotel were friendly & very helpful. Rooms were made up beautifully.

Last time in Vegas I stayed at Caesars Palace, but Red Roof suits me better.

It's a budget hotel but a bloody good hotel.</p><br>Suited our purposes<p>This hotel was close to UNLV and worked out great for out weekend of baseball to see SDSU win the Mountain West Tournament. It was in walking distance to the Hard Rock Hotel/Casino and a small shopping center with a collection of fast food and elegant dining choices and a drug store so we could pick up anything we may have forgotten. The beds were comfortable, the room was quiet and the shower had great water pressure. For the price we felt it was a good deal. Our only complaint (and it's not really a complaint) was that we could not get a Kingsize bed at the time we booked or checked in, if we had that would have made it a better experience for us. The staff was friendly and the room amenities and the continental breakfast was okay.
Room Tip: We were one the first floor on the inside of the hotel.

Although it's a way off the strip, there's a fair selection of places to eat within a couple of minutes walk - a strip mall with cuisines from around the world, the Hard Rock Caf√©, with its choice of meat and bread dishes, and the Hofbrauhaus, which is the wurst choice.

One word of warning, though - it is conveniently located near the airport and you will be reminded of it every few minutes as the planes make their final approaches.</p><br>clean budget motel<p>We were just passing through Las vegas and needed a dog friendly motel that we could drive up to the front door of the room. (road trip...lots of luggage)
Red roof inn was clean and affordable. Recently renovated.
Room included fridge. Bed was comfortable. Location on busy Paradise road but room was quiet.</p><br>Newly renovated, clean and efficient<p>This is off The Strip on Paradise Rd so it is quiet. Plenty of parking and comes with a continental breakfast when you stay here. Just enough food to make it to lunch time. Paradise Road is parallel to Las Vegas Blvd, so even tho you are just a ten minute drive away, it is quiet. It is non-gaming so there is no scent of any tobacco smoke in any of the rooms. As the previous reviewer says, there is a small refrig, small 'kitchen' counter, and I believe a two burner stove...tho no kitchen or flatware comes with the place. The rooms are sufficient in size and there is plenty of hot water for showers. The only thing you might wish for is an in room safe...there is none. I would definitely stay here again, the management, and all the help were friendly. Tho the motel is on the approach to the airport, one hardly notices any noise from the overhead planes.
Room Tip: Get an inside corridor room to insulate any noise from passing planes overhead.

It is under the airport flight path but only an issue if trying to sleep during the day after partying all night</p><br></body></html>
