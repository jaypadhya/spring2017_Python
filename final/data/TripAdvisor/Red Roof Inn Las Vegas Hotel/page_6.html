<html><head><h3>Red Roof Inn Las Vegas Hotel Reviews Page 6</h3></head><body><br>You Get What You Pay For<p>This motel is very old and dated. You can hear everything. Our door never shut all the way. You can hear everything outside if your on the bottom floor. The breakfast is one of the worst I have seen. They have bagels, stale pastries, regular flavor oatmeal, apples and oranges. AND right next door to a strip club. Not the best for families. The staff was extremely pleasant!</p><br>I would not return here<p>This hotel is not far from the airport( 5 min drive). Red Roof is a well known chain, so I was expecting a much nicer place to stay. It is right near Hard Rock Cafe. It seems to be a very poor part of town. There are homeless people roaming around the property, going through trash cans looking for food or anything else that might be useful. I feel bad for them. No security personnel around. I felt it was an unsafe area. I would certainly not bring children to this hotel. Our room was dingy. My bed was not steady. The mattress tilted to one side. I felt that our room was overpriced considering what was offered. The only plus was the microwave and stove. Internet did not work in the rooms. I would not recommend this hotel and will not return.
Room Tip: Free wifi that did not work...lots of noise...unsafe area...choose another hotel.

The accommodations are in line with the lower price you pay of a room here and I thought the added kitchenette was a nice surprise. This review would be higher were it not for the fact that the hotel is right under one of the flightpaths for the airport.

What this means, faithful readers is that there is a jet flying over your head every 5-20 minutes. I stayed on the second (top) floor and there was not enough insulation between myself and the airplanes. Fortunately I brought earplugs and that reduced the noise enough to let me sleep... and miss my alarm... :)

If such things do not bother you, the amenities and staff were well worth the price. If you are a light sleeper, you probably want to stay across the way and the Hard Rock, or further from the airport.
Room Tip: Perhaps the first floor is quieter.

Room had fridge, microwave, stove, coffee machine with coffee and tea bags. Free Internet - both wireless AND Hardwired. Nice complimentary continental breakfast - Bagels, Oranges, Apples, Oatmeal, Coffee, Milk, Orange Juice. I will now seek to stay at a Red Roof when I travel.</p><br>OUTSTANDING!<p>Came back to Vegas after Xmas & New Years' & after burying my Mother in early Dec. Getting back home to Vegas late at night, rather than trudge all the way up home, up north, got room here and WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED! What a wonderful respite! It fit our budget, as Red Roof ALWAYS does, the reservation was PURE simplicity thanks to their great phone (800#) staff). The place looks great from outside, even late at night and just like online pics w/a New Orleans' French Qtr theme, which is cool to me! Close to McCarran Airport and the strip, as well as easy back onto 1-15 for our journey north the following morning. Great breakfast w/great bagels, too and they have kitchenettes for future reference. A final PLUS is their great staff! Book it NOW!
Room Tip: Parking right in front of your room- a BIG +++!!!

For a recent trip I decided to stay at the Red Roof Inn thanks to it's proximity to the Hard Rock Hotel. I was suprised by the cleanliness of the hotel, the large size of the rooms, and the perfect location. There are two great places to eat next door- a sandwich shop and a pizza place that have great, reasonably priced food.

One can walk to the strip in 15-20 minutes, and if you really have to take a cab it doesn't cost much. I took one to the Wynn for a dinner for $10, and you can walk to Bally's and take the monorail all the way north to the Stratosphere if you want.

The check-in was quick and the desk clerk quite amiable, as was the check-out clerk. I checked out in about 60 seconds. Checking in might have taken 2 minutes. the bed was just right- not too hard and not too soft. Goldilocks would be happy here.

The only suggestion I would make is taking earplugs if you stay on the second floor. The airplanes taking off from MacCarren airport can be a bit loud, but have NOTHING to do with the hotel itself. You can hear the jets in the rooms at the Hard Rock as well. Just a fact of life. Planes are loud. And honestly, you would need earplugs at the Wynn, The Venetian, or any of the others thanks to the party atmosphere that is Vegas. Just not for the jets......

I was thrilled to have a refrigerator, stove, and plenty of room to fix a snack when I wanted. The TV was an older one, but I wasn't in Vegas to watch TV. If you are, then you aren't spending your time wisely. That said, I had plenty of channels and the TV was fine.

No complaints, and I'll stay here again whenever I'm in Vegas. Hotels like the Hard Rock don't even allow a cooler! This one give you the fridge and no security guard is going to hassle you for bringing food into your room!

The National Atomic Testing Museum is very close, and is worth the visit.

This hotel is a great deal, and was worth every penny when I stayed there.
Room Tip: Downstairs if you are sensitive to planes taking off.
See more room tips</p><br>Definitely met the requirements, good location<p>In Las Vegas, one is rarely in their room for a long period of time, so for me it really doesn't have to be a palatial room for me to sleep. The room was nice- clean room, ironing board/iron, Wifi, TV,kitchenette and microwave in room. It was a nice 15-20 minute walk straight down Paradise to the convention center as I was there for work. Easy to catch cabs as the hotel is right across from the Hard Rock. Lots of eating and entertainment places nearby, and a CVS around the corner. I have to commend the staff on duty- these ladies provided exceptional service beyond what I believe is expected from normal hotels. Always friendly and helpful. I would stay here again for business.</p><br>Among worst places I've ever stayed<p>When I checked in, the room had a very strong, sickly sweet smell as if it had been sprayed down with a cheap perfume. The TV picture was of such poor quality it was barely watchable. Low water pressure meant taking a shower was not very pleasant. Breakfast was terrible (very poor selection, no healthy food selections). Place had a grungy feel. I'll never stay there again. Having said that, the staff were friendly and helpful, and despite the grungy feel, the room was clean.</p><br>No fuss hotel in decent location, met the requirements<p>This hotel had all we wanted. Clean room with wifi, kitchenette and microwave in the room with adequate space for two night stay. Close to strip but not in strip.

Good understanding staff.

Basic breakfast. But reasonable for the rate. It was a bit crowded at 9 am (less space and more members were waiting to use the toaster)</p><br></body></html>
