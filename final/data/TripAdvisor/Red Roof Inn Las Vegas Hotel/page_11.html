<html><head><h3>Red Roof Inn Las Vegas Hotel Reviews Page 11</h3></head><body><br>Great location just off the strip<p>We spent 3 nights a Bally's then decided to stay an extra 2 nights in Las Vegas. This hotel was great value for money. The room was clean and tidy with microwave and fridge. My only dislike was the hotel accepted pets in the rooms which is fine but I think they would be better having designated rooms (just like smoking and non-smoking) as our room did smell of dogs and this would maybe put me off staying there again?. Not being into pets at all this wasn't very nice but on the other hand my friend (who has her own dog) could not smell anything. The pool area was extremely nice and we spent a full day sunbathing and just chilling around it. The staff were extremely helpful and couldn't do enough for us.</p><br>Friendly 2 Star Hotel<p>People were friendly. The room was big and clean but did not have a safety box. The wifi was fast but of course due to the fact that I was close to the reception. Breakfast was included even though I did not manage to eat because I left too early. My bag was there while I was gone which was nice of them and the receptionist was really friendly. The room was next to the car park so it was noisy at times but I slept well. It was cheap and it was close to the Hard Rock. Taxis are abundant but the bus shuttle to the airport never showed up even though it is just in front of the Hotel. Overall good experience.</p><br>Location and Price<p>Across from Hard Rock and next to a shopping center the location is convienent. This weekend must have been busy in Vegas because all hotels bumped their prices up. Red Roof was still moderately priced. Room is very nice for the price. If you are staying for a few days the refrigerator and microwave are a nice bonus. It sucks having a nice (expensive) dinner that you can't finish and not being able to keep doggie bag for next day or later that night snack. Beds were firm for my liking but not bad. Free continental breakfast is very nice bonus.</p><br>Great hotel !!!!<p>I stayed at this red roof from March 17th to the 22nd it was really good and i got a good price 90 days in advance . It is by the hard rock . There is a cvs like 5 minutes away . Having a microwave and refridgerator in the room was a big plus . The rolls and bagels and juice and coffee every morning ( FREE !!! ) at this hotel every morning was nice . I am staying here again when i visit in September .
Room Tip: I stayed in the 600 section which was very quiet .

Then when I asked if there's holding our luggage, I was told I can check-in early for $20+tax. I also ask for a receipt but was told at our checkout. There's no difference between the room we rented during Comfort Inn management. Clean, kitchenette, minifrifge, microwave,iron w/ ironing board, hair dryer, descent size "closet", and provided the requested pillows. As other reviewers, you can hear noise planes, vehicles passing by the street, and inconsiderate driver with loud music/muffler. Price gouging is this establishment specialty, i.e., from $49.99 to $130+. It's more for Friday and Saturday. I found one for under $60 on a Friday. I wish I did not make any reservation with this establishment. What a ripoff! Upon checkout, I was told by "Loisa" that she cannot provide me with a receipt. Incompetent staff! My family and I are traveler's and member of three well known travel clubs. This is the first time I was refused and lied to for a receipt. Where is your integrity??</p><br>Overpriced &amp; very noisy<p>The sign outside claimed rooms from $49.99 a night. We paid $135.34 including taxes, 'resort fee for the slowest wifi ever'. Thanks so much Red Roof Inn for taking full advantage of Nascar & Construction Expo to gouge your customers. Place adequate & clean. Wanted a room close to airport as flying out early the next morning. Read other Tripadvisor reviews - funny no one mentioned Red Roof Inn directly on landing path for McCarran airport - very noisy</p><br>A good value<p>Large room, with very good lighting. Our room was very quiet. The room was very clean, had a microwave, refrigerator, coffeemaker, cooktop, iron and ironing board, hairdryer. In addition to the desk with a chair, there was also a small table with two chairs. The bed was very comfortable. The sink was outside the toilet and tub, sometimes helpful if you are traveling with your parents or older children. Breakfast was basic, with bagels, rolls, oatmeal, juice and coffee. The food was in one room, and plenty of tables in the next room. The lady in charge of the breakfast did a very good job of keeping everything clean and well stocked.</p><br>Perfect for Business &amp; Pleasure<p>This is my second stay at this Red Roof Inn for business. The rooms are clean, spacious, just minutes from Las Vegas Blvd and across the street from the Hard Rock Hotel, and ten minutes to the airport! Straight in, straight out. Free WiFi

The staff is friendly. The location is ideal for business and pleasure travel. Well priced if you don't want to be on the strip. Parking is included, so is the Free WiFi. Yes, there is a small resort fee, but worth the few bucks.

Dinning is close by. The Silver 7 (just a half a block walk away on the same side as the hotel) has a very good, hot and fresh buffet. You can eat breakfast, lunch, and dinner all for under $30 per day! The staff is friendly, the buffet is clean, regularly refreshed. If you don't want a buffet, you can have a prime rib steak dinner for under $10! Of course you can eat at the buffets on the strip as well.

This Red Roof Inn, Las Vegas is the business person's friend and the budget conscious fun getaway traveler. You won't be disappointed. Priced right, clean, friendly staff, easy in and out.

Located 10 minutes away from McCarron Airport, accessible by cab or Bell Trans bus shuttle, directly across the street from the Hard Rock Hotel, this motel is super convenient with all the amenities a business traveler or someone taking a Vegas vacation looking to save money has everything you will need. No room service but who cares, it is close to restaurants and a CVS (like literally next to the motel). It's an easy one mile walk from the strip, a bus stop located across the street, and the housekeeping is first rate! They even leave a free bottle water after each cleanup. The staff is so friendly and helpful, they enabled me to extend my stay twice when I was there recently and let me stay in the same room. Plus the rooms have a kitchenette, king size bed, free wi fi, plenty of great TV channels, and the bathrooms are roomy. Plus affordable, you'll never pay strip hotel prices but beware they do charge resort fees which I wasn't aware of but it's reasonable. This is the only place I'll stay each January when I attend AEE and will definitely consider this spot next time I'm in Vegas for a vacation. I've stayed on the Strip but for me the Red Rook Inn is the best place I've ever stayed in my more than 30 times I've been to Vegas. LOVE LOVE LOVE this place.
Room Tip: free breakfast, free computer use in the lobby, free coffee 24 hrs a day at the lobby, cheap laundry...

The room was great and roomy with m/w and refrig. The Inn was close to the airport and the strip. The only thing I did not like was the $5 / night resort charge.</p><br></body></html>
