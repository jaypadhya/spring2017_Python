<html><head><h3>Red Roof Inn Las Vegas Hotel Reviews Page 9</h3></head><body><br>Good stay<p>We enjoyed our stay for 3 nights : clean room, swimming pool, friendly staff, fridge & microwave. However, when they confirmed the booking, they didn't mention that there was $8/day energy fee (they said it was sort of resort fee). This was the third hotel that we stayed in LV. Might return in future.</p><br>The Roof is not Red<p>I recently stayed at this hotel for three nights. The carpet was not clean, and the bed was like sleeping on a board. The television was older model, with a poor picture. This hotels advertises that they are relatively new, but nothing in the place is new. It appears they took over from some other hotel, and just changed the signs. The free breakfast is not work the energy in the hot heat it took to get to the office. Juices are watered down, and the pastries are very poor quality. The check in and Checkout process are tedious, and lengthy, and some of the staff are rude. The noise from the planes flying over is very loud. This hotel is in desperate need of an overhaul.</p><br>Roaches in the bathroom!!!<p>Stay away from this infested roach motel with a crummy manager to match!
Upon arrival (my reservations were for 2 ADJOINING rooms) we received 2 rooms (one BEHIND THE OTHER --not adjoining) which was not going to work for my family of 6. So we drove back to the office and requested a change. The ONLY BRIGHT SPOT in this dump was the lady at the front desk - KEILA - who had to deal with my wrath (so sorry) who proceeded to change a room so that now we had 2 rooms on the same floor with just a room between them. Upon entering the room we noticed cockroaches in the bathroom..enough said. We took our belongings and headed back to the office. There is more to this story and I lodged a formal complaint, but please DO NOT GO HERE.</p><br>A Good Value for Money Place to Stay!!<p>In Vegas, one is never short of options in terms of where to stay. However, if you are after an inexpensive place with most key essentials thrown in, then Red Roof Inn along Paradise Road is the place for you.

Reception staff…..wonderful…….motel manager……nice and helpful. He (the manager) is also a font of all knowledge when it comes to what one can and should do in Vegas…….depending on one’s outlook on life.

Breakfast could be better, but hey…….there are a 101 places where one can pop in to for a decent breakfast and for all the other pluses this motel has to offer, that is a miniscule issue.</p><br>Great Hotel Find<p>We only needed a hotel for one night, but Saturday nites in Las Vegas are very pricey. We got this hotel for $65., with no resort fee and it included a continental breakfast. It had a nice pool, very well managed, and a very pleasant staff. The rooms were clean and comfortable, and it even included a small kitchenette with mini-fridge and microwave. The city bus #108 runs to and from the airport and lets you off 1/2 block from the hotel.
Room Tip: I booked this online

I have stayed in several places in the last few months and this is my new favorite place. After having an absolutely terrifying experience at another place - I came back here and I've come back several times since. The hotel staff is very professional, the location is quite good if you're here to gamble or see shows, and the rooms are cozy (a little dated, but clean and comfy.) I really like that it isn't a huge place, you can park in front of your room, there is a fridge and microwave. I love it!</p><br>One night stay<p>My husband and I stayed here while traveling. We were not going to be in town long and just needed a place to sleep. The staff at the hotel was very friendly. We didn't have to wait at all to check into our room. Parking was great, off street, close to our room, and we felt safe in the parking lot. The room was a little outdated but it was very clean, and the air conditioner felt wonderful after traveling all day. In the morning we heard MANY airplanes taking off. This is not the hotels fault, but you may want to know this if you are planning on sleeping in. It didn't really bother us since we were up early. A lite breakfast was served. A welcome way to start the day. The only part of the stay I didn't enjoy was the bed. It was terrible! I hate saying it, because the rest of our stay really was very good. The bed was rock hard. Our hips hurt when we woke up. I probably would not stay here again because of this. I just did not get much rest.</p><br>Great value<p>This is a typical Red Roof Inn, meaning it offers small, clean and comfortable rooms at a great price. In a city with so much tourist price-gouging, that's pretty great. It's best to have a car here, especially when it's hot out. Parking is easy, and the staff are very good. The free breakfast is above average, including good coffee. I would happily stay here again.</p><br>Best Hotel Experience Ever<p>Great price, great location, very clean, friendly helpful staff, cute décor, nice pool, and the rooms all had a stove/fridge/microwave. We were there for shows at The Joint in the Hard Rock, and couldn't have been closer. If you can't tell already, we really enjoyed our stay!! Will stay there next time too.</p><br>Perfect stay<p>Both desk clerks, day and evening, were excellent and put us first! The pool was the perfect temperature and clean towels were available. I wish there was a better breakfast, but it was fine because most hotels don't even serve breakfast.</p><br></body></html>
