BEAUTIFUL NEW ENGLAND-STYLE, GINGERBREAD HOUSE ARCHITECTURE<p>Review Written By Dr. Vivienne Kruger, author of Balinese Food: The Traditional Cuisine and Food Culture of Bali (Tuttle Publishing, 2014).

Location: 4350 Paradise road, las vegas nevada 89169. Right across from the hard rock hotel and casino.

I stayed here at the red roof inn in las vegas and loved every second of it! The architecture is absolutely gorgeous--reminiscent of traditional, small-town, new england--with gingerbread-like door frame accents around the rooms. The door jams were decorated in christmas green colors, complemented by cranberry red doors. The lawns were well-kept and pretty--it is like you are in a magical eighteenth century hideaway with ultra-modern facilities inside. My room was superb--extremely bright, cheerful, clean, and designed with the comfort of guests in mind. Everything was brand new in quality, cleanliness, and upkeep--sparkling bathtub, sinks, microwave, tea maker, tv, bed linen, curtains. It was like a hilton in quality at $50-60 per night. Pet friendly, and no pet fees. A free, delightful breakfast nook greets you in the morning--bagels with cream cheese, apple juice, teas, hot oatmeal, fresh fruit, pastries--bon appetit! The location is superb, right across from the famous hard rock hotel and casino and a short ten minute bus ride to the famous "las vegas strip" of casinos.
The very best part was the 5-star quality of service that i received from the ultra-friendly and very professional front desk staff. Chantel, a beautiful blonde woman with a comparable heart of gold, helped me find a local taxi, put tags on all my luggage, and assisted me to use their free lobby computer. Guests are treated like royalty at this establishment--smiles are everywhere, and pets are pampered.
This red roof inn is a treasure--a true find in las vegas! Highly recommended!
Room Tip: Excellent hotel--a great place to spend your Las Vegas vacation.. Ground floor rooms are very con...

The room was clean and the staff were on top of their game cleaning the room everyday. Looking for local information the desk was able to accommodate.</p><br>great price and location<p>I have chosen this hotel because I was looking for good prices and location.
Red Roof Inn has those attributes and I liked so much it. It is close HardRock casino and there are a few options around for eat, drink and have fun.</p><br>Met all my and my pet's needs<p>Red Roof Inn was a few minutes drive to Caesar's where my event was being held. I was there for five days and was really pleased. I expect this to be where I stay for my future Vegas trips, as I like to bring my pet when I come. I didn't take advantage of either the coffee in the lobby or the continental breakfast they provide, so have no opinion on those. I love that they have a mini-kitchen (microwave, refrigerator, small stovetop, sink, and cupboards) in the room! I hate having to go out for every meal, especially because I'm very tired after 12-hour days at the event that brings me to Las Vegas.

The staff is very accommodating and friendly. I changed the temperature control on the small refrigerator, and it stopped working. I called the desk and had a replacement within 15 minutes!

This Red Roof Inn isn't new or fancy--neither of which I care about--but it has exactly what I want and need. If you are like me and especially if you like to bring your pet, you will like this hotel. One caveat, though. It's quiet, another big plus for me. However, it is under the flight path for the airport only a couple of miles away. If you are a light sleeper, stay at a place further from the airport.</p><br>Clean Comfortable Room, Good Location, Friendly Service<p>I stayed at this Red Roof Inn for a Friday and Saturday night to avoid paying weekend prices on the Strip. Check-in went very quick and smoothly. They gave me a room where I could park directly in front, which I thought was thoughtful. The breakfast is continental and is served until 10 am. Bagels with cream cheese, danish, instant oatmeal, some fruit, coffee, juice, and milk. No cereal and nothing hot. I walked across Paradise Road to the Hard Rock and enjoyed some gambling there while Kiss was in residence. An adjacent shopping center has a great pizza place called Joe's New York pizza. It is delicious! Few other restaurants there also. You hear loud jets landing at the nearby airport, but most people don't stay much in their rooms while in Vegas. I would stay there again and maybe bring my dog next time! The lady working in the breakfast room was extremely pleasant and wished most people good morning upon arrival.</p><br>Very reasonable<p>The room has a stove and microwave. The rates are wonderful! Only negative aspect is the noise of planes which is often beginning early morning and not very often after 10:00 pm. But after awhile one gets used to hearing them. The room is very clean and staff friendly and helpful.
Room Tip: Close to the airport and very convenient for rental car return.

They had found it, so I gave them a shipping address and credit card number.this was on November 8/2014 it is now November 19th and I don't have the camera. After many calls nobody has called to give an answer on what day it was shipped and the name of shipper. I'm on in California. Don't stay here at all!
Room Tip: Don't stay here
See more room tips</p><br>good value<p>We stayed three days while in vegas. The room we had was clean and comfortable. we ran the a/c - heater just once in three days; the room stayed comfortable. breakfast was sparse, but, again, the price was reasonable. the swimming pool is small, but clean. we really enjoyed the microwave and fridge; we brought back left overs and had another meal and put water bottles in to cool. some people we talked with talked about drunk people late at night outside their rooms, but we didn't hear anything. however, this isn't the hotel's fault. one great thing - it is right across the street from the hard rock complex. we liked that place a lot. the front desk people were helpful to find things to do in vegas. we had only one small problem; the 5:30 am wake up didn't happen.
Room Tip: get the middle buildings. the front and back were right by two major streets.
See more room tips</p><br>A place to sleep and get refreshed<p>This trip to Vegas we decided to not stay at a casino over the weekend and this facility was only a few blocks from the strip and directly across the street from the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino. May not be within waking distances to the strip for most, but it's not out of the question. The room was found in acceptable condition and clean. A small stove, refrigerator, microwave, coffee maker, TV with limited channels and a small desk were available. AC was operational and acceptable for October but may not be efficient enough for a hot August day in Vegas. Bed and pillows were acceptable and it was possible to get a good nightâ€™s sleep. Shower was clean and acceptable but it was impossible to maintain a constant temperature, it was either way too hot or way too cold. Towels were very thin and ruff. Breakfast was minimal offering coffee, tea, Danish, toast, bagels and fruit and was replenished continuously by a very friendly staff member. Check-in was very crowded took an extended period of time and the staff was very frazzled. Check-out was much smoother. Based on this experience I would return and recommend this facility but keep in mind it's not a resort but it's an acceptable place to sleep and get refreshed.
Room Tip: There seem to be less activity towards the rear of the property.

This is it! Leslie and Keila were very professional and accommodating at the front desk.</p><br></body></html>
