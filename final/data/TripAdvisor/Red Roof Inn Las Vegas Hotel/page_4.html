The rooms are clean and it's not far from the strip. I think the best part of my stay was the dealing with the front desk attendant Eloisa every morning!!! She is the best font desk attendant I have EVER dealt with and I travel ALOT.. She is beautiful, very very nice, and has a very friendly comforting smile, she always helped me extending my room each morning even taking her time to let me know their availability in coming up days. If there is some kind of award or recognition she DEFIANTLY DESERVES IT!!!!! I highly recommend you stay here anytime in Vegas!!! P.S Just ask for Eloisa she will defiantly make sure you feel very welcome and enjoy your stay...
Room Tip: Ask for Eloisa!!

-Well-kept, manicured grounds
-Friendly staff (a bit sarcastic)
-Room was decent and wifi worked well

The bad:
-Check-in was a debacle, with one staff person and about 15 people waiting in the lobby
-My non-smoking room reeked like smoke (after the long check-in I didn't want to wait for another room)
-Pretty skimpy breakfast</p><br>Upcoming Visit for W. Hollander and this review could change!<p>I have read most of the reviews on here and most have been very helpful. I am booked to stay at this Inn on Friday night and I will definitely post a truthful review of my experiences with this particular Red Roof Inn. I am hoping for a pleasant stay with good wireless access etc. Stay tuned!</p><br>We had a great time<p>We stayed at Circus Circus and the Stratosphere and the Excaliber hotels and we found this hotel to be the best place to stay, even though it costs a little bit more. It was worth the extra money, the people were great, our room was nice and clean, and was like a little studio apartment. We really appreciate everything the staff did during our two day stay.</p><br>Reasonably priced.<p>Checked online for an economical place to stay in Las Vegas as we were flying out of McCarran the next day. This motel suited our needs and was quiet and clean. Didn't have a chance to check out the breakfast as we left around 4:00 a.m. Enjoyed sitting around the pool earlier and watching the planes coming into the airport. Noticed that they farm out their pool maintenance and if it was me I'd fire them. The pool looked like it hadn't been vacuumed in ages. Just dabbled our toes and the water was actually cool. The outside decor definitely has a French Quarter appearance. The greenery is fake and a little tacky. I'd opt for real hanging flowers, maybe bougainvillea, which would be beautiful.
Room Tip: The wi/fi gave us a hard time but we were supplied a number for tech support. John had us online in...

Walked in the room and was surprised that they had a kitchenette! The night started with my killing 2 cricket looking insects that were right next to my bed. Got in bed, the mattress isn't much softer than the floor. The pillows suck. The second night here was one straight out of a horror story....So I'm in my bed unable to sleep because of the heat. So I'm up turning on and off the air conditioner at 3am when I noticed my room door being opened by someone with a small flashlight in his hand. I jumped up and he immediately starts closing back the door which I slam shut on him. I called the front desk and they sent security who was unable to find anyone. About an hour later I hear the door Knob turn again, someone then pounded on my door and then banged on the window. I noticed it was an intoxicated white male. The security came and fixed that situation. I know I will not be able to get an ounce of sleep tonight. You also hear crickets outside your window and and a little noise from the airplanes (not much of a bother). The keycards also stopped working by the second day! I had to get new ones reissued! Won't be sleeping here ever again, even if they offered the room for FREE!</p><br>double charge<p>I booked this hotel through Vegas.com (which also charged my credit card) but got charged by Red Roof Inn also. I only noticed this on my credit card statement--no receipt or billing from the hotel. I had to call three times to speak to someone, with different information each call. This seems bad business practice at best. Be careful about charges from this hotel.</p><br>Good location, awful bed<p>We didn't realize we'd be in LV right before the "fight of the century" which jacked room prices into the stratosphere. When we booked, there was very little available under $400. We got this room for $185, and though we hated paying that for a RRI, we had a 7 am flight out and needed to stay near the airport at the tail end of our vacation (to AZ). The room was actually very nice--super clean and roomy. The desk service was excellent, despite being under siege by the fight fans in town, many of whom were pretty rude. My only complaint: the bed was the worst one I've ever slept in in an American hotel. I'm not usually fussy, but this was truly a miserable mattress. Not the staff's fault (and they were, like I said, great). One other thing: they were selling rooms for $125 to people without reservations, but we were stuck paying the original price. Again, not the staff's fault, but it might have helped us sleep better if they had reduced our price to the walk-in price.</p><br>So Close to So Much!<p>I chose Red Roof Inn because it's so close to UNLV, the location of my daughter's dance competition, and had really reasonable rates. However, it's also very close to the Strip, the primary draw for most tourists. Unfortunately, it's also close to the flight path for jets taking off from the airport. This didn't unduly disturb us, but it would be a problem for light sleepers.
Other pluses were the room's kitchenette, the friendly help at the front desk, and the warm and hard-working employee running the dining area. The breakfast wasn't anything great. Some cold pastries and bagles, all plain, some plain instant oatmeal, some fruit - but it managed to get our day started without standing in some buffet line or waiting for a menu.
Two minor drawbacks: we had problems off and on with our keycards, and if we had wanted to use the kitchenette's stove top, I didn't see any pans or dishware available. They might have these items available by calling the front desk, but I didn't check.
Free wi-fi was available as well and worked fine after a slow log-in period.</p><br>Nice Night<p>We had to make last minute arrangements for 1 Saturday night in Las Vegas. It came well reviewed and the price was right. We arrived after a 6 hour drive and were concerned at check-in because of a loud club next door. We were put in a nice room on the side away from the club & didn't hear a thing. The room was nice, clean, and everything worked. The bed was too soft for my taste. The free breakfast was nice but limited. Overall, a nice place.
Room Tip: If you want sleep before 2 a.m., request a room away from the club
