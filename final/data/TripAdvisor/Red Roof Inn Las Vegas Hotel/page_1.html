<html><head><h3>Red Roof Inn Las Vegas Hotel Reviews Page 1</h3></head><body><br>Good place to sleep.<p>I stayed during a weekend two weeks ago. It took about 10min to check in because when we got there the lady at the front desk was checking in 1other woman. (Check in should NOT take that long.) Also she does not look at you in the eye and she looks to much like in a panic mode. The room had a small fridge which was great! a stove top, a small table with two chairs perfect to eat, a hairdryer. And an old tv. ( Channels worked so its ok). I stayed on the 2nd floor and honestly I had no complains when it comes to the noise. OUTSIDE would be a different story. There is a plane that passes by every 5min. Thats ! out of the hotels hands I understand. Breakfast is basic, a piece of bread and a fruit. This hotel is right in front of the hard rock hotel and right next to a strip club and next to a few restaurants and a CVS walking distance. There is suppose to be a Computer for the guest to be able to print out a flight pass but there was no computer when I asked the girl at the front desk she confirmed that no they didn't have one for some time and that this issue had already been addressed but nothing has been done. Know that this doesn't resolve the issue for your guest. Maybe offering to print it out from your front desk computer could of been a solution. The Las Vegas strip is 30min walking distance and 4 minute car ride. Over all hotel was pretty decent gotta remember its not a high end hotel. My stay was a last minute stay. I would stay again but I would be my last choice.</p><br>Great location<p>The room was a great value. It is very close to the strip. It's right across from the Hard Rock. The room was a nice little "suite" with a small kitchenette. Check in and check out were super easy with no hidden fees. It's also very close to the airport. We were worried about the noise from all the air traffic, but it was very quiet. The breakfast left a lot to be desired.</p><br>Best Vegas Value<p>If you are on a tight budget, you should consider this place.
I stayed 4 nights when attending a trade show at the Convention Center.
Its clean. Quite close to the airport. Decent breakfast. I found the staff to be efficient and friendly. Affordable restaurants within walking distance. Its across the road from the Hard Rock. What more do you want...
Based on the above, I would say its the best value stay I have had in Vegas</p><br>Highly recommended!<p>Clean, very roomy hotel! 2 minutes from the strip! Staff very nice and helpful! Quiet area! Restaurants around! Across from Hard Rock, perfect if you want to go to Rehab!l, walking distance! Perfect for the price!</p><br>Great Value<p>As we know each Red Roof Inn offers different amenities. This one by far was worth the value. Non smoking/king bed room, small fridge, microwave and 2 eye range. More television channel options than most hotels. Bed comfortable enough, spring mattress with 2-3" mattress cover. Provide a full size bar of soap, smaller bars provided as hand soap(what they should be for lol). A table/2 chairs, closest w/hangers. Drying towels kind of small. Next door to a club, but doesn't disturb you. Across from Hard Rock Casino and close to others, also close to a strip mall shopping center which includes CVS or Walgreens (24hr) and several restaurant options. Gas station etc. So strip shuttle is not necessary everything in walking distance. Front desk customer service was great. The few complaints I had were either handled or already on a to do list. Oh design of room is not as modern, a little outdated (if that matters to you).</p><br>Great value, convenience and staff<p>Each staff person from front desk to housekeeping that we interacted with was very friendly and accommodating. You can tell they care about guest comfort and convenience. When assigning our room, the front desk gal put thought into where to place us based on our group - she offered a room closest to the front lobby. It was a pleasant stay. The hotel is convenient to everything (airport, the Strip, CVS, shopping, etc.). The hotel is very well maintained and clean by comparison to some other dog-friendly hotels we've been to. There's a small kitchenette with two burners (ask for pots and pans from the front desk if you need them), small dining table area, good bathroom vanity dressing room area, comfy bed and pillows, and the continental breakfast was a nice perk. We normally don't take the time to write reviews, but want to give kudos to this hotel and its management and staff.</p><br>Weekend in Vegas<p>We stayed 3 nights at the Red Roof Inn for Halloween weekend in Vegas. The Front desk clerk was the nicest and most helpful person I think I have ever encountered, her name was Keila. Nothing was a problem, early check in and two rooms near each other, I would stay here again just because of her! The room could have been up dated, and the carpet needed a good cleaning. I thought the bed was comfortable and the room was pretty big. I liked that it had a fridge and microwave. The plane noise starts up pretty early in the morning so bring earplugs.</p><br>Traveler<p>The room was ok. The bed was like a rock. Very very hard to get comfortable, tossed and turned all night.
The water was cold in the afternoon and evening, seemed unusual being there were very little occupancy.</p><br>you get what you pay for<p>The room was not horrible, but had a distinctive burning leaf smell for the first 6 hours we we there. The second day they completely forgot to make up our room while we were out, for 9 hours. On the plus side, they got a housekeeper there within 5 minutes to make up the room when we called. Front desk staff were pleasant, but I would not stay here again, nor would i reccommend it to anyone I know.</p><br>comfortable very good value<p>I just stayed for 3 nights Sat.-Tues, I found my 2nd floor room very clean and quiet. I heard planes overhead during the day, but never heard them at night. I had an excellent internet connection, plenty of hot water showers and friendly staff. Included breakfast, consisted of bagels, a toaster, butter, cream cheese, fruit pastries, hot water for hot oatmeal, oranges and apples and dispensed orange, apple juices and coffee/tea...not exactly bacon and eggs....but not bad for the price! I did find the location a fair walk to the strip, about 20-25 mins...but I did it 2x. There is an outdoor pool, which was in use by several guests. If rock music suits you while gambling, the Hard Rock Hotel/casino is right across the street. I would definitely stay at the Red Roof Inn again.
Room Tip: I was on the north side 2nd floor, room 226 and found it quiet from the overhead planes.
