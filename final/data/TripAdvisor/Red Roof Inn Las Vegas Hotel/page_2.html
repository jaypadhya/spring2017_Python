<html><head><h3>Red Roof Inn Las Vegas Hotel Reviews Page 2</h3></head><body><br>You get what you pay for - So pay more somewhere else<p>We stayed her for 1 night after spending a week on the strip as our flight was delayed and no other hotels had availability due to a large convention taking place. The room was located on the second floor with no elevator, and so we had to carry our bags up the stairs in the dark, although at this point we were just happy to have a room for the night!

The room was grungy and old, with hard pillows and mattresses. It just had an 'odd' feel to it and it's not the sort of place I would stay voluntarily. There was also a lot of noise coming from outside and as two young women on their own the whole experience made us a little uncomfortable. It had a dingy motel feel too it - Like something out of a horror movie.

Our flight wasn't leaving until 8pm the following day but the hotel staff let us stay by the pool until 5pm - Even though check out is usually 11am. They also looked after our baggage for us which was kind. The pool area was okay, can't really fault it apart from the children were playing in it throughout the day. They were causing disruption and splashing us on purpose, whilst also trying to wake my friend up when she was sleeping. I did not see any adults with them the whole time we were there, and children being left unsupervised around a pool all day is pretty dangerous!

The hotel is in a strange area, I definitely wouldn't feel comfortable walking around at night. We ate at the Hard Rock Café as we didn't want to eat the hotel breakfast and even the other diners in there were strange, despite it being a popular chain. It was quite a contrast having come from a week on the strip!

You definitely get what you pay for with this hotel. Its about $70 dollars per night, so you are not going to get the same service, guests and amenities as you would on the strip. This hotel would suit travellers on a budget wanting to come to Vegas and don't have very high standards. The whole experience was a bit weird and to be honest I would rather pay triple the rate and stay in a nice hotel on the strip.
Room Tip: Don't get a room here
See more room tips</p><br>Comfortable Place!<p>We stayed 7 days in this hotel. It´s clean, there is a small kitchen with a refrigerator and a microwave. The staff is very friendly and helpful. You can park your car in front of your room. It´s not on the strip but in Vegas you really need a car. You can visit all the big and nice hotels on strip parking your car in those parking lots. If you are going to visit Vegas you don´t have to spend your money in expensive hotels, you can stay at RED ROOF INN and save your money.Everything was ok, but you have to pay 8 dolares per pay for an extra light fee. In my opinion, this is not fare.</p><br>Great location and price<p>This hotel is right across the street from Hard Rock. It is next door to a great Italian restaurant as well as Japanese food. There is no resort fee which saves money in Vegas. Breakfast is also included. Perfect location to save some money. Check in was easy and everyone is nice and helpful. Was surprised that there was a small refrigerator and stove top in the room. Could be really useful</p><br>Great location with the right price<p>Located near the Strip and Hwy. 15. It was convenient to restaurants,Hard Rock Cafe across the street along with several restaurant option types -- chains and independent. Also a couple of miles to a Catholic Church. It has a nice pool area with a waterfall, but no hot tub. The room was very clean, pillows were small, and the room was a little outdated. It is near the airport that can be a plus, but it means planes flying over during the day.</p><br>Nice Location &amp; clean<p>Very nicely located, next to the Hard Rock and a short walk away from a CVS. It is all you expect from a Red Roof Inn, affordable and clean. Will stay there again if all the resorts are out of my budget.</p><br>Red Roof Ready<p>Have been staying at the Las Vegas red Roof Inn regularly during the Summer and It has been a Great experience every time.
Chantal the New Hotel Manager was absolutely Terrific in seeing all My friends and family members Vegas vacation needs were met and she has a Wonderful staff to back her up with Friendly customer service.
The location is Just Right, being much more accessible than the Major Strip Hotels and the pool with the waterfall was Perfect.
Will definitely be back and recommending My International Friends and Associates too.!</p><br>Clean, good location, price is right<p>While checking in the front desk staff was very helpful and answered all of our questions. The room was very clean but dated. We chose this hotel because of the price and location. The room was sufficient to our needs of a clean safe place to sleep and shower but the bed was not very comfortable. The pool was nice and looked to be well taken care of. Only 8 seats around it but it never looked like it was full which surprised me with the amount of rooms they have, 8 buildings. There is a CVS and a shopping plaza with a variety of restaurants just down the block. This is directly in the landing path of the airport so there is jet noise at all hours of the day and night. The breakfast was only bagels, danish, fruit and possibly cereal. I saw milk but did not notice if there was cereal. The apple juice was very watered down. My only complaint and why I gave just an average rating was that on the website it clearly states there is a computer that you can print boarding passes on. While checking out I asked about it, the lady at the front desk pointed to a desk and said the "computer is down and since it was the weekend it wont be fixed until Monday". I do know this to be a flat out lie to my face because I had read in other tripadvisor reviews that it was not working while other gusts were there recently. I took a chance that it would be working when we got there but alas it was not and this lady looked annoyed when I asked about it. This added cost to our trip because we then needed to pay to get the boarding passes at the airport. I would stay again because it is a very clean safe place to stay. Everyone I encountered with the exception to the lady who checked us out was very helpful and attentive. It is a good value for what we needed the room for.</p><br>Perfect Location<p>The location was a mile from the strip and super easy to navigate in and out of the parking area. The Hard Rock Casino was right across the street and there were so many good places to eat within walking distance. The hotel had 7 buildings and I was surprised to get a room with a refrigerator, wet bar, and microwave. The TV stations were crisp and clear. The bed wasn't the best but the room was nice and clean with nothing too fancy. The free breakfast was very basic with muffins, bagels, sweet rolls, oatmeal, coffee, and juices. It was definitely worth the price I paid for the room. I would stay here again.
Room Tip: I like the upper lever because there is nobody above you. This is a 2 story hotel and I don't t...

Rooms aren't sound proof from the road noise but with the aircond going it cancels it out. A $10 taxi from the airport (incl tip) is pretty reasonable too. The beds are comfortable and rooms spacious which make this accommodation good value for money.
Room Tip: Look for one away from the main road to reduce road noise.

For 2nd day, when I came back from outside, my room key was broken and didn't open. they asked us to provide another room, but all our valuable and needed clothes etc are in there... after 8hours (it was 2am) I complained to hotel and finally they called someone to fix. It tool only couple hours but they didn't call someone to fix those hours so I had to wait outside of the room even we had to leave 6am for our next destination. after that, I called hotel and talked with Ms. Kay but she said, system was down and took my phone number and name but never called back.
I complain from their website but haven't heard anything for last 6days.
Ridicurous....
Especially front desk people were not helpful.

Overall, room is ok but hotel service was not good at all.</p><br></body></html>
