<html><head><h3>Red Roof Inn Las Vegas Hotel Reviews Page 8</h3></head><body><br>I was pleased!<p>I needed an inexpensive place to stay in the area for a concert. I found this place to be reasonably priced for the area and well located for my needs. The staff was very nice and the room was pretty clean and comfortable. Overall, I had a very good experience and wouldn't hesitate to stay here again if such accommodations were needed.</p><br>affordable accommodation off the strip<p>This accommodation is spotlessly clean but a little dated. The Service staff are warm and friendly. The lady who booked me in was very efficient and friendly but front desk staff on other days were not as warm, I wished to know the location of the nearest public transport and one lady did not know, and the other was very offhand. My query was answered by a fellow guest. the Monorail is on the Strip so its of no use to guests at the Red Roof. but No 202 Flamingo rd bus goes from the end of the block both in the direction of the strip and from outside Ballys...in either case it won't bring you past the Inn but it knocks enough off the journey to make it worthwhile if you are tired. The walk in takes about 25 mins. One of the morning breakfast staff was very friendly and welcoming. Breakfast is continental buffet. Wifi signal is weak. Be aware
that its right next door to the airport so planes come and go very early in the morning. The prime rib steak at the Silver 7 next door was great....and the buffet good value and good quality</p><br>Bad customer service ..TJ you are the worse management I have ever encountered!!!<p>My family and I stayed 2 nights at this hotel and I must say its not that great ..customer service wasn't that great when you have nothing but old people working there in a bad mood..breakfast bar isn't breakfest you might as well go to a gas station and get breakfest there ...we called to let management know how our stay was and we said we weren't going to stay there no more since he was rude and he said fine don't stay here go somewhere else!!! His name is TJ so if you stay there make sure you don't run into him!!! First time ever in Vegas everything was amazing besides our hotel stay ..we will stay somewhere else next time we go there ..I guess you get what you pay for!!! Red roof in should get rid of management there since they're not management material !!! I've been 20 years in retail and I must say this is the worst!!!</p><br>A good stay<p>Overall the Inn met my needs. Nice kitchenette. The TV reception was not clear but then I did not watch much TV being in Vegas. A bit of a distance from the strip but near the Hard Rock, so it worked for me.</p><br>Great place near Hard Rock and restaurants<p>I really enjoyed my stay here a the Red Roof in Las Vegas. I stayed during the Sema Show when all the rooms were sold out. I had to find something and this was one of the few properties available. I'd like to give a shout out to Chantel at the front desk She was outstanding, great personality and made my stay memorable. It's in a great location and is near a shopping center with a CVS and Capprioti's restaurant which is my favorite go to place if I want to eat in my room and watch tv. I liked being near a CVS where I could buy some things. There is a microwave, refrigerator, and coffee maker. Also saw an iron there is a hair dryer as well. The room has WIFI and that was great. Breakfast is served daily and they fruit, bagels, cereal and pastries. I have never stayed here but definitely would stay again as it is convenient and off the Strip.
Room Tip: I did hear airplane noise but I think a room at the back of the hotel would be best. I seemed to be...

But the one in Las Vegas blew my mind. First, once you pass your cancellation deadline, you'll find out that there's an $8 per NIGHT 'energy surcharge' for your room. While I found later that this is in small type at the bottom of their page, it is NOT reflected in the 'price of room' that you check out with online. Very deceptive, and I talked to 10 different hotels in Vegas while I was there, and NONE of them had an 'energy surcharge.' Even the front desk helper said, 'I shouldn't say this, but I agree, it's very dishonest, but my manager makes the decision.'

On top of that, after charging you $8 per day for energy, they have the nerve to place a sign right inside the door to your room asking you not to leave lights or your A/C on (in the Vegas heat, mind you), in order to 'save energy'. Seems to me that if I'm going to be charged a ridiculous $8 per day for energy, that I should be able to leave anything on that I want.

Then the staff completely failed to service my room, even though I was out of there for the day by 9 am. Nothing better than returning from a day with a family member in the hospital to find a dirty bed, no clean towels, and a full trash can.

Finally, the treadmill was broken in the gym, which was the only thing that I wanted to use in there, with no signs of being touched or fixed in the few days I was there.

The manager likes to point out that they're the 'cheapest on the block,' but in this case, they're simply cheap, and cheats at the same time. Don't waste your time, or your money. Sorry Red Roof Inn, but this loyal user will NOT be staying with you in Vegas again.</p><br>They have added $8/day 'resort fee' since Aug2014<p>Still a very good location...off strip/no smoking/no gambling. But now please take into account the added 'resort fee' to the room cost. Evironmentally friendly hotel...no need to change sheets or towels everyday. Just go to the front desk or ask one of the friendly housekeepers for fresh towels if needed. See my previous review.
Room Tip: Get an 'inside' corridor room in Bldg 7 to block the noise from the flight path of overhead...
See more room tips</p><br>good size room well equipped<p>We stayed three nights here at the start of a month-long USA trip from the UK. Check in was uneventful, we had a ground floor unit close to the main road which was noisy - room 323. The room was clean but much of the furniture and fittings were quite old, the massive CRT TV looked really out of place - we didn't turn it on. WiFi was good and rock steady. Breakfast was toast, cereals, bagels etc and was adequate but not exciting. A cheap and cheerful hotel which is just adequate.</p><br>This is a hard review to do.<p>This is a hard review to do because property was clean, nice, well located and staff was very friendly. BUT---they had an undisclosed (to us from site we used to book--Hotels.com) $8 per night "Energy Surcharge". Not going to break us, but a very dishonest way of hiding the true rate when we booked and prepaid. We likely would have booked with honest disclosure of true rate, but we have an innate dislike and distrust of dishonesty and this left a very bad feeling toward hotel, chain and booking site. Would have rated higher if they had not been so dishonest. The second day we observed others surprised similarly sadly (for the staff) dressing down front desk staff (who don`t make policy). If you book this, beware of real rate or you may be surprised by the "I know you prepaid (and room is non cancelable and you won`t find another last minute room now anyhow), but we have a $8 daily per room energy surcharge which will be added to your bill at the end. We also had one day when housekeeping did not do room. OK for us, but may not be for others.</p><br>Stayed 1 night<p>The room was average needs to be updated though. I've stayed at other Red roof Inns that have been updated. The bed was comfortable & clean. The room had a kitchen on the bottom floor. I didn't use the tv but it was a older model. The staff was friendly quick check in & check out. Its ok for one night but if I was going to spend more time in Vegas I would stay elsewhere.</p><br></body></html>
