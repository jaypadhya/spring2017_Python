<html><head><h3>Red Roof Inn Las Vegas Hotel Reviews Page 5</h3></head><body><br>Nice for a night<p>I was very (VERY) worried about this hotel because it breaks my #1 golden rule: thou shalt never, EVER, stay in a hotel with individual doors in the rooms to the outside. I've been burned several times by hotels with this old layout and I vowed that I would never stay in this type of older hotel again. But, sigh.. I had a weak moment and wanted just one night in Las Vegas on my way from Salt Lake City to San Diego. After reading the reviews of this hotel, I decided to give it a shot and it wasn't bad at all. I always expect loud sounds and partying throughout the night in these hotels without an interior corridor, but this one wasn't bad. There was a lot of noise from the airport but that didn't bother me at all, I was worried about partiers and then worrying about my car being out there with people partying. But, all of that worrying was for nothing, there wasn't any noise or shenanigans outside at all.
The front desk folks were super, super nice. The bathroom was good, but it's an old property, a few decades old for sure, but everything worked and the bed was great. I would probably stay here again if it was sort of in the off-season like my stay was.</p><br>One of the weirdest experiences.<p>Just spent 4 hours in the car heading into Vegas from Dana Point, CA. Decided to stop into this Red Roof Inn after spotting the $60 a night price tag on Tripadvisor. Went in and asked if they had any rooms available and the woman working goes, "Okay, sweetie, how old are you?" What?! Not that it's anyone's business, but I'm 25. I told her this and she kind of repeats, "25," to herself - maybe she didn't believe me? - and then proceeds to tell me that it will be $89.99 plus tax. Annoyed at this entire interaction, I told her, "It said $60 online," and marched out. The whole thing just put a bad taste in my mouth. I'm on my honeymoon, for what it's worth, but, yes, I was wearing a hoodie with my hair in a ponytail, so I realize I probably do look less than 25, but really, the appropriate thing to do is to just politely ask for my ID had I booked, which hotels typically look at, anyway. Don't ask customers their ages. Also, have consistent pricing. Didn't bother staying; drove to Henderson.</p><br>What a Surprise this Red Roof Inn was!!<p>The pictures of the property do not do justice to this place. I was hesitate to stay here but being Red Roof Inn, I decided to try it. I love this place!! First off, THE ROOM was very large with excellent bedding and amenities. Great television, internet service. The bathrooms are large with excellent shower heads, good water stream. The room had a lot of lights, and the furniture was heavy duty. Nice large trash cans in the room. No heavy "perfumed" room, just smelled clean. The property was quiet with the exception of the jets overhead as the hotel is under the takeoff path and the jets are very visible which I found to be fun! I easily ignored the sound of them but for those "pansy type of people who like to b-tch about everything" may not like it. It was never a bother to me. The property is very cute and sorta resemblance a "French Quarter" atmosphere with nice pan windows, freshly painted building and hanging flower pots on the balconies all in excellent maintain appearances. Front desk was nice and helpful. Parking was never a problem and was always very close to room. What was great it had two entrances/exits in parking. Once you get your foothold if your not familiar with area, the back entrance/exit gets on the road fast avoiding the traffic on the front side which is Paradise Road and very busy. Using Swenson Ave in the back, if you know the area can easily shave 10 mins commuting within the city. It is close to everything, The Strip, outside the strip area, easy to get to the airport, other areas of the city or downtown. This is a great place for those who hate the traffic of Vegas and the Strip. It is good for those attending UNLV events or visiting other areas of the place. Overall I recommend this place to everyone and will now stay here to get a better room and way lower prices and less frustration in navigating within Las Vegas!
Room Tip: rear rooms seem quieter.

- Near to strip
-Clean and sufficiently big rooms
- Each room had a microwave, mini refrigerator and a stove, which we felt was really great, especially for the price at which we booked the hotel
- Eateries, CVS at 2mins walking distance from the hotel
- Wifi speed was good
- Special mention of the lady at the breakfast area. She wholeheartedly welcomed each one of us with a big smiling 'Good Morning' every day :)
- Ample parking space available

Cons:
- Nothing as such, but could add some more options to breakfast, like corn flakes, slice bread or apple juice.
- Airplanes fly just over the hotel. So the loud sound could be a concern for few.
Room Tip: It is a two floor hotel which doesnt have lift. Prefer first floor if you have heavy baggage.
See more room tips</p><br>Decent Hotel<p>The hotel was adequate. Ample parking and clean. When I pulled into the hotel I was able to check in early and saw workers cleaning the rails and outside doors. I thought that was great. Most hotels don't take time to do that. Each room has a kitchenette in it. Which includes a microwave, mini fridge, and two burner stove. The bathroom had a vanity seat and the sink was separate from the toilet and shower. The room was clean. The televisions are old school... So no flat screens. I believe they had cox cable so plenty of channels. Hotel is next to Walgreens and tons of shops as well as eateries that stay open 24 hours. It's in walking distance to strip. No jacuzzi just a pool with a nice waterfall. Breakfast consist of bagels, oatmeal, apple, orange, Danishes, milk, juice or coffee. I didn't care for that older gentlemen manager. He made me feel uncomfortable. He was way too friendly. Women who travel will understand what I mean by way too friendly. When I saw him before I knew he was the manager he seem to have a good time talking to what he called " a lady of the night". On my fourth day, I was told by him they must come in and clean my room. I told him that I didn't need service. He asked what are you worried about in there money, or your dog. I told him neither I concerned about my disabled mother and what she was suppose to do while their cleaning. He then started asking more questions. Which was none of his business. I don't know if he thought it was okay to question me since I look really young but I'm not. I get a lot of non-black people who try and say and do things that are not by far okay because they think she a minority and young so I can say whatever I want to her. I also told him about incident that happened on hotel grounds that wasn't funny at all but the maids were laughing. He flat out called his maids stupid in front of me and some other staff. Very unprofessional. He was creepy and unprofessional. Too friendly not in a nice way. I would stay here again IF they hired a different manager who knows how to conduct himself in a professional manner. Would not recommend this place if young women are traveling alone.</p><br>Inexpensive, Clean, and Convenient<p>My husband and I were looking for a night to stay in Vegas after flying in from the east coast before making the drive to Arizona the next morning. We had three basic requirements:

1. Cheap: This was just a place to rest for the night before a long drive the next day.
2. Clean: No roaches!!
3. Convenient Location: We didn't want to stay in a congested area and really just wanted to be close to the airport.

We are happy to report that the Red Roof Inn met all of our requirements, and we were very pleased with our stay. Our check-in was smooth and the desk staff was friendly. The free breakfast is simple, yet sufficient. There were bagels, fruit, juices, oatmeal, and pastries. We had a kitchenette, but didn't stay long enough to put it to use. The internet was fine while we were there, but there weren't a lot of guests so I'm not sure how well it scales on a busy night.

Yes, the airplane noise is loud. It is right next to the airport and the planes will fly VERY low on approach to land. It woke me up once during the night, but it wouldn't prevent us from staying again.

I would recommend this hotel for travelers who just want a close, clean, and inexpensive place to spend the night. (As long as you aren't a light sleeper.)</p><br>Adequate, but loud airplane noise!<p>I chose this hotel for it's lower end price and convenient location on a quick Vegas business trip. The staff was very friendly and helpful when I arrived. The room was just the basics, and clean. The bed was adequate. The reason I would not return to this hotel is that it was located directly in the flight path of the airport. Planes taking off every few minutes were VERY loud. So if you're a light sleeper, you will likely require earplugs.</p><br>Fantastic Stay<p>We visit Las Vegas every February and always stay at this hotel. The staff is always exceptionally nice and welcoming! The rooms are always very clean and comfortable. The location is great.They always have coffee in the lobby as well as in the rooms. The breakfast room is also very nice and clean. Always a very nice stay!!
Room Tip: Just be aware that the airport is near by so there is noise from planes flying over..Just not an iss...
See more room tips</p><br>Good enough<p>Systems down so checking in took ages. After that a clean room with noise from the airport for free. Breakfast was .... well nothing. .. bagels, sweeted bread, weak coffee and no fresh orange duice. Thats it.

Good hotel to arrive late, drink a lot, sleep trough noice and leave early</p><br>Great economical hotel if you do not mind airplane noise<p>I felt this hotel was a bargain for Las Vegas; OK location away from the noisy Strip, my room was clean and spacious with several amenities, had at least a simple (though not very tasty) continental breakfast, friendly staff and a pool. One should know, however, the hotel is located just north of the airport and you can hear the planes landing/taking off until late into the night and in the early morning. Ear plugs and/or a sleeping aid (or both) will help you sleep better.</p><br></body></html>
