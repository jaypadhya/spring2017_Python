<html><head><h3>Red Roof Inn Las Vegas Hotel Reviews Page 12</h3></head><body><br>Never again<p>Just one quick night in Vegas to catch a flight the next morning. And a long night it was. The room was old and smelly. The street noise was awful. Homeless people wandering past the hotel all night. And also thru the parking lot, talking cursing and whatever else street people do. Police sirens constantly along Paradise.The WiFi didnt work. My laptop anti virus software went crazy when I even tryed connecting to their server.
Just a totally beat up motel. Avoid at all cost
Room Tip: Stay away from Paradise Blvd

Very dissappointed this time. The prices went up and quality down. The complmentary breakfast is very poor. No more cereals, eggs and waffels. Jello-quality is worse than used to be. First day my kids found a dead bird in the pool and screaming jumpped out. We told to service and they closed the pool for already almost 24 hours. We are staying here for 3.5 days one day of which already passed and pool is still closed..Used to recommend this place to ally froends and co- workers before...no more.....Changed the name, rised priced, quality is down........ Soooo dissappointed...wont come back any more...</p><br>Great Place, Great Staff<p>Recently switched to a Red Roof Inn from a Comfort Inn, this property looks great and is in a very central location. Right across the street from the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino...and less than 5 minutes from the Vegas Strip...what more could you ask for? Coffee 24 hours in the lobby? Done. Full continental breakfast in the morning? Done. Waterfall in the pool? Of course.

Clean place, friendly staff (especially Eloisa at the front desk.) Highly recommended for the price.</p><br>think about staying here<p>It was like a studio apartment. Tables, chairs, desk and chair, dresser, kitchen complete with a stove top, frig, micro and sink (no dishes or cookware). We really liked it. It is old, you know, the bathroom and tub grout starting to crack and peel. Teeny little towels and pillows. But the room was nice, we thought. Right on the flight path of McCarran so be prepared for jet noise. We love that but a lot of people would just hate it. No elevators so if you need that, better order up a room on the ground floor. I liked the "smallness." Drive right up to your building, no valet required, walk to your room. And it is OFF THE STRIP.
Room Tip: If you need an elevator, order up a room on the first floor. NO ELEVATORS.

The last jet we heard was about 11:30pm and we didn't hear another until about 8:45am. This was (so we heard) a converted apartment building. Definitely not a luxury hotel but the prices reflect that. We turned the heat on and it smelled so bad we turned it back off right away. Maybe hadn't been used in a while. Air conditioner blows across one of the beds which also was annoying. if you just need a place to crash within walking distance of the strip this is okay. Hard Rock Hotel is right across the street so you're in good company.
Room Tip: Stayed in the back on the second floor away from the busy street.

location is ok, you must walk 3/4 mile to centre . or take 202 bus.

Suggestion to management : a Microwave in the Breakfast area should be good,</p><br>I'll stay here again!<p>Perfect place to stay. Easy walk to the strip but not so near you hear all the noise. Super comfy beds, clean rooms, great shower (plenty of hot water), nice variety of items for breakfast, free wifi, and even had a fridge, microwave and burners! The staff were all friendly and gave great directions to places I wanted to go. They even printed me off maps. They have a great pool with waterfalls and are also near North Vista Hospital. Oh, and they have parking right in front of the rooms; AC is super cold. About as perfect as you can get that isn't home.
This is where I will stay from now on when I travel to Vegas. So glad I found them.
Room Tip: We had a room by the pool and it was fine.
See more room tips</p><br>basic room , pretty good breakfast, will consider staying here again<p>arrived at the strip at 2 am , went to the hotel we booked , they told us hotel.com has messed up and thereis no room for my family , so we had to go find another place to stay for the night , found red roof , luckily they had rooms available , the guy was quite nice and helpful .

room is basic but does have range , wet bar and a microwave , the only down side was thay they only have double beds , we really needed queens for our family of four.</p><br>Worked well for us<p>Pulled in late, tired ... did not want to hassle with one of the mega hotel-resort-casino experiences, where checking into your room is like checking in at an airline ticketing counter. This was about as stress-free as you can get. Pulled up to the front, walked a minute to the front desk, got an excellent rate, parked about 10 feet from my front door. Whole process took maybe 5 minutes. No resort fee, no parking fee. Room was relatively large, clean, well maintained. Pool looked dirty, we didn't use. Breakfast is very basic. Free wi-fi. Across the street is the Hard Rock Hotel with easy access to a big casino that rocks all night long. This property is right below the approach for McCarren Airport, but apparently there are little to no flights at night. We slept well. In the morning we heard a whoosh and saw an enormous jetliner very low over us. Just a head's up.</p><br>Great place to stay<p>Very clean rooms...friendly staff....and loved the parking spaces right in front of the rooms! No need to carry your luggage through a casino to a parking garage but close enough to the strip. Nice small pool but didn't get a chance to use it. My husband and I agreed we will definitely be back here!</p><br></body></html>
