<html><head><h3>Siena Suites Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 6</h3></head><body><br>Bang for your buck!<p>My family of 6 went and we were on a budget and we were extremely happy with the spacious beautiful rooms with full kitchen and a living room area! The place was very clean and both 2 rooms had there own bathrooms and we even took our dog which was a plus because it is pet friendly and the employees were extremely friendly and also made our stay very comfortable! They accommodated us and we even extended our stay longer since we liked it so much! The pool area was so beautiful and the staff members were superb! You will be very happy with this choice and if we go to Vegas there will be no other place my family and I would stay but there again! Great new appliances and our 2 bedrooms and 3 beds were so comfy and we had 3 tvs with cable and wifi also! I would recommend this place to anyone and u r located around many restaurants, stores and gas stations and our favorite Jack in the Box! U will be truly happy and the management does a great job in keeping their place in high standards and we say thank u for our long week stay! Rate it a 10 and will be back again real soon!
Room Tip: For a large family you can fit 6 people in the 2 bedrooms plus the couch in the living room can fit...

It is more of a long stay condotel. The No Smoking room stank of smoke and was filthy. I was greeted by some youths in the car park snorting some kind of drug. The clientele looked generally as dangerous as the neighbourhood. Do not stay here.
Room Tip: Stay somewhere else
See more room tips</p><br>The staff was very accomedating the room clean but older<p>Our family lived in Las Vegas for quite awhile years ago. Various hotels advertise internet, non-smoking rooms etc. but because some hotels are older or people smoke anyway they frequently smell of smoke. This happens with many hotels all over Las Vegas. If you want to be pampered and catered to then go to the Bellagio, if you are a regular person or some one with a budget then you might want to come here.

The Good: The A/C was great and so was the kitchen. The staff was kind and helpful. We were late and they kept are reservation, however we did call them and let them know what happened. One of my relatives is disabled and they booked a bottom level suite. They had to have a breathing concentrator and it was delivered to the hotel and they helped me move it to the car and helped with extra blankets and towels. The internet was excellent!!! Many rooms close to the strip have terrible internet and it can't be accessed, we never had that problem here. The room itself was clean but older. It had a kitchen which was great for those who want to save money. The laundry room had A/C and was nice. It also does not have a casino in it. I feel that this was good for my family and for those who don't want to be around casinos for what ever reason. There are casinos near by as well. The pool and hot tub is nice and secured, it had extra towels, bathrooms, and a shower. Also, they have security there.

The not so good: Although they say it is a non-smoking room there is an older smell of smoke but so does many other casinos.. It also does not have a restaurant at the Siena Suites but they are several near by that are family friendly and for those on a budget. We bought paper plates and plastic silverware it does not have a full kitchen. There are no elevators. The ice machine was empty but many are at other hotel with 117 degrees in Las Vegas!!

We will go there again.
Room Tip: Call ahead and ask for what you need especially if you or a relative has a disability.
See more room tips</p><br>It'a actually a good place!<p>One of the biggest extended stay hotel we ever stayed. Got rooms at the bottom floor. It's convenient if you have toddlers and lots of stuff to haul. With 2 decent size bed rooms with it's own full bathrooms. It includes ironing board and a hair dryer. It's good that the sink is separated from the bathroom. It has TV in both rooms and lots of storage drawers. Beds are comfortable. The kitchen and living room divides the bedroom. Full kitchen minus pots and pans (something health issue). There's a freezer/fridge, a microwave, a stove if you'd rather cook. If not, fast food are walking distance. Omelette house is our favorite! Couches are ok but the carpet is DIRTY.Never walk bear foot! Even though it says a no smoking room, still smells like one. They really tried hard to masked it with febreeze. It's pet friendly! Pool is awesome! Go early around 7am. It's not hot yet and you're alone! Staff were accommodating. Parking is plenty. Always be cautious on your surrounding. Cops patrols around the area.</p><br>Convenience of Home<p>I loved this Hotel/ Accommodation suite. It has a Refrigerator , Stove with oven, Cabinets, a counter top area, microwave as standard amenities. We reserved a room with 2 beds. It came with palor and bedroom which had 2 TV's and 2 air condition units. There is a sofa as well. Room is of good size and was clean. There is house keeping everyday and a maintenance all the time. A security guard now patrols the property which made me feel very secured. It is Vegas so people were up & about all night but nobody both anyone. There is also 2 pools and it is well maintained. To me, it is a Vacation Rental house with 5-star service. It was well in my price range and i was totally happy with the service. I will definitely return and recommend this place if you are visiting Las Vegas and looking for kitchen amenities for cooking your own food.
Room Tip: Inform the front desk agents of the kind of room you would like.

Call the frt desk and had the manager/director, Bill come to my room. He offered me another room I said no thanks i wanted a refund. He agreed that he would do that. I drove back to los angeles that night. A week later I had not received my refund. I called and spoke to Bill again and he said it was taken care of. He took my email for the purpose of sending me a confirmation. I never recd the email or my money. HE LIED TO ME. I spoke with him again within a few days he apologized and said he would take care of it and once again LIED....I never recd my refund as promised or an email. STAY AWAY FROM THIS HOTEL!!
Room Tip: stay away...friendly staff but roaches manager Bill a liar
See more room tips</p><br>Great value, even better people!<p>After being on a round of speaking gigs that kept getting extended, I came across Siena Suites! The staff, led by Bill Deyo is their secret. Great value. However, where they really shine is in their customer service. Having stayed at several hotels on this swing, none of them matched Siena Suites genuine care and concern. I highly encourage you to check out Siena Suites. You'll be glad you did.</p><br>Good no more...!!<p>Place used to be great but they have become too big for their own good..Ignorant staff...Beds were so beat I woke up with back problems..Used to give silverware and dishes for the kitchen All gone. I left early very disappointed..!!</p><br>You get what you pay for<p>We were there for 3 nights for a soccer tournament.
Spacious rooms, clean, basic, we did not need more.
Of course if the kitchen had some ustensils it would be great!
Front staff was very helpful!
Was a great location for friendly tournament.</p><br>So much potential but management is missing the mark<p>From a value/price perspective, it would be hard to criticize this property. The rooms were spacious, clean, and marginally appointed. Tv sets were antiques, no pay per view (hotels generate additional revenue on this), the kitchens had no utensils (like I am going to bring pots and pans with me on vacation). So here are a few ideas for "management" to consider: how about "rental dishes/kitchen supplies option" so that those that want it can pay for it and the revenue adds to the bottom line. Need to have mini-groceries on site. Not a full. Blown store but the quick and easy stuff that your guests wouldn't mind paying a little extra for when they roll in late and don't want to rush out and go shopping. King beds need to have a night stand on each side of the bed. Don't want to deal w/employees and inventory management of foods? Try vending machines, they make money too.
Room Tip: Four story buildings w/o elevators so if u r physically challenged call in advance.
