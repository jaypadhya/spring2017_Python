<html><head><h3>Siena Suites Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 15</h3></head><body><br>Not So Good<p>The list of reasons why we wouldn't stay here again is long- everything from the tack strip showing in the bedroom and causing cut feet to the fact that while it is a SUITE hotel they have NOTHING in the kitchen- no paper towels, no utensils, not even a single glass! There's 1 nightstand and 1 dim light in a room with a king bed. This is a large facility- over 500 rooms. This was Rugby Sevens and the place was booked well in advance. (really close to the stadium) But apparently for the second year in a row they chose this weekend to drain one of the two pools and jacuzzis. Imagine how many people that is trying to use ONE jacuzzi.... NASTY. We booked back in August and asked for our two suites to be together. First they put us in Bldg 1 (avoid at all costs- noise from Boulder Hwy is AWFUL) and they put the other room an entire building away also on the top floor. (did I mention no elevators?) There are TOO many reasons to avoid this place. Maybe during a not so busy weekend it would be OK...Maybe. Saving grace? It did appear to be very clean. (only reason it got a 2 and not a 1! BEWARE their website- it tries to load malware and spyware on your computer!!
Room Tip: Ask for a room not on Boulder Hwy!

We picked it because we were visiting family that was close by so don't come here if you are wanting to be down on the strip. This hotel is out in Henderson. The price was what I thought was reasonable for a 2 bedroom suite. A kitchenette, couch, and dining set were in the main living area. The table only sat 3 and there were 6 people staying in the suite. This wasn't such a big deal since we never ate there. There is no breakfast of any kind, but the suites tend to be for extended stay. All of the furniture is old, outdated and a little bit stained. The couch was very uncomfortable...you could feel the boards in the back when you sat down. The beds were worse. The remembered to put the sheets on, but forgot everything else. With the condition of everything else I would have ripped the comforters off the beds anyway. They only provided one set of towels and I went to call down to the office and the phone didn't have a cord to plug into the wall so I had to walk 5 minutes. When they did give me towels they were old, ratty, pool towels that were more the size of slightly enlarged hand towels. I don't recommend this place to anyone for any reason. Even the outside was littered with trash and animal stool.
Room Tip: Get a top floor so you can't hear the people above you.

We are not picky at all, we stayed in hostel in Europe and Canada, we are backpackers enjoying nights in a tent. But if we paid for hotel we would expect: 1. Soup. 2. Shampoo.3. Towels.4. Cofee packs for kitchenetts. 5. Not to be waking up at 9 am in Las Vegas. 6. Vacuuming floor at least sometimes. You got an idea... When we came after long day and found no towels in the room we were told there were no available staff to bring them, no problem, we walked to officed and picked the towels by ourselves. Next day the story repeated exactly and I had to file complain with the manager. There are so many extended stay places in that area of Las Vegas, so my suggestion would be to try another one.</p><br>Another Police Raid (3rd today)<p>I am here now. I showed them an online special coupon but they don't honor those. Went ahead and paid for a week, $223. Went to recommended building 13. Police immediately came and busted someone on second floor. Watched big stakeout in parking lot and they grabbed another guy. Scary to watch from window. Tried to use gym in morning. Both treadmills broken. Long term residents say they have been broken for months but left for show. Bed is slanted to left, broken. Will take days to replace. Maid only shows up once a week. Room smells terrible. Front desk people very nice and apologetic. Provided extremely weak old coffee in lobby. Room coffeemaker inoperative. No toilet paper, must bring your own. Most rooms leave trash right outside door, no apparent place to put it since dumpster is overflowing. Rooms have hardly any light, very dark. Nice tvs though. Gangsters roam all night through parking lot, breaking into cars because there is no security here, apparently. Very scary to be on ground floor, lots of people peeking in your windows. Was advised not to leave my laptop in room if maid visits from prior problems. No safe in room. No long shower curtain so floor floods each shower. Would not dare to bring kids here. No stores nearby. Police hide behind Mulligan's Bar and Restaurant in parking lot to arrest for DUIs, so watch out. Homeless roam right outside on Russell Road. Way overpriced compared to apartments, they charge almost 1200 a month to rent. Tried to cook in kitchen but nothing to cook with. They claim all hotels in town are not allowed to have pots and pans or silverware, but I believe differently. You can do better, but front desk people are so very nice and professional it almost makes up for the terrible experience staying here.
Room Tip: Stay away from front office. Was told it was a nightmare to be there.

my money, and would not at least
donate the ticket to someone. Read
the excessive complaints against them. I say, book directly with the airlines, Siena Suites, and never buy
trip insurance from Access America.
I have donated money to the needy, but they refushed
to donate my money to charity.

I will use Air America , and stay at my beloved Siena Suites. it is my home away from home.</p><br>Horrible rooms and bad customer service<p>This is the worst hotel I have ever stayed. I usually dont write bad reviews about my stay, but this time I took time to write as this hotel is very decieving when you look at their pictures and woudl not suggest anyone to stay here with kids. They have a full kitchen/dishwasher but no utensils. They dont provide any of the common things that a normal 1 star hotel would provide like soaps/shampoo/creams and towels. The soaps that they give after you call the reception couple time is The rooms were dirty and had dead cockroaches. The beds were hard and the rooms/bathroom was stinky that you have run the noisy exhaust all thru the night. We looked at the pictures in their website which shows pictures with utensils and neat looking rooms and were totally disappointed on getting there. When asked why they would not have utensils the receptionist was very rude to answer. I would never ever stay. The price may be cheap but its not worth even for a free stay.</p><br>Re edit of my last review<p>I would like to edit my last review. This hotel, by far the ones I've stayed at, is one of the best, especially for a family of mine who wants their own bed for less. I went on a weekend getaway on the first week of August with my family(consisting of my parents and a 7 year old). At first I reserved through hotels.com because I got a deal of $49 a night. When I got there, my reservation was not found but the lady was still gladly to give us two nights at that rate(thank god). When we got our room, on the third floor, the room was very clean. I read reviews that there were no utensils in the kitchen but, surprisingly, the cabinets were full of them. The bed was comfy. The bathroom was clean, although the door is in a bad place,since you hit someone coming out if they're at the sink. It was August and of course, the weather is hot. The AC was not working very well. It did work, but not enough. It was not a huge problem, since I was not in the hotel much.

I went to the pool, since there are two. It as kinda dirty, but because there were so many people that weekend. The jacuzzi was very relaxing. What made me dissapointed was the "state-of-the-art" fitness center. It was the size of the average bedroom with absolutely nothing to work out on.

Overall my experience with Siena Suites was good and would return next time. I recommend this hotel for families and people who would like to stay out of the hype of the Strip.</p><br>Bring your own cleaning supplies<p>Maybe we just got the luck of the draw but after taking a shower and seeing blood spatter on the towel rack, it completely changed my perception, and I'm not talking a little bit, it looked like someone got hit really well. Anyways, we called the front desk and the lady didn't seem too bothered by the situation and they moved us next door. (We had family in the same building).

The next day we left to have breakfast, came back and saw. The housekeepers in the room we were in, the one with the blood. And my boyfriend goes in to see if they cleaned it up and they hadn't. We go in to sit by the door and the housekeepers left right behind us. They didn't even clean it up.</p><br>Bad customer service<p>Bad customer service, rude and lazy people especially front desk. People works at the front desk looks very dirty and unprofessional. I think they need a proper training. Housekeeping doesn't speak English, and I don't think they have the proper papers to work in the united states. I have to investigate on that. Rooms are very dirty and it's smelly, no wifi, bed is Terrible, bed bugs, roaches, mouse. Swimming pool is dirty. I would not recommend this place to anybody. This place is junk.</p><br>Value for Money<p>Stayed here last weekend. Well kept outside nice landscaping clean and tidy .
We had a two bedroom two bathroom suite with full kitchen and living area.
All clean and decent furniture.
Helpful reception staff . Only downside was no Wifi just corded free internet . No good for notepad users!
I would definitely recommend to anyone who wants a value stay away from the hectic area and off the strip!</p><br></body></html>
