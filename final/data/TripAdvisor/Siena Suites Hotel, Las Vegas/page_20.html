<html><head><h3>Siena Suites Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 20</h3></head><body><br>Wonderful in all respects; sorry we didn't know about it before.<p>Because we are snowbirds our stay is 3 months. We have been totally pleased. All staff are warm and welcoming, and we found our unit very clean. The maintenance crew is quick to attend to any needs which may arise, and do it courteously as well... Thegrounds are well maintained, and offer an initial welcoming feeling. We have found the pool to be clean and at a wonderful temperature. In addition, the housekeeping staff is courteous, and do a good job. In short, we are thoroughly enjoying our stay, and hope to return next year.</p><br>Roger's Excellent Las Vegas Adventure<p>One of the most enjoyable aspects of staying at the Siena Suites is the accomodating and friendly staff they have. These folks are always willing to go out of their way to make my stay pleasant- almost like home! In addition, it is conveniently located and there is a sparkling pool to enjoy in the afternoons. The grounds are well kept and inviting. The rooms are clean and fresh. These are just a few of the aspects that keep me coming back year after year.</p><br>Great location and good value for Snow Birds.<p>We have enjoyed our winter getaway stay at Siena Suites for 5 winters now. It is so
convenient to all parts of Las Vegas. It is 10 - 15 minutes to both Downtown and to
the Strip or airport. The access to eating and entertainment is great.</p><br>I'd recommend this place to anyone.<p>This is our third winter here, we stay for about 2 1/2 months. I can only say good things about it. The staff is friendly, courteous and all our needs have been met. We have attended a couple of "snowbird breakfasts" which were fun and informative. The rooms are clean as is the pool (heated too). I have and will continue to tell everyone about Siena Suites and have no hesitation in recommending it for a short or longer stay.</p><br>Great place for Snowbirds to stay<p>Our 1st stay at Siena was Jan-Mar. 2005. We had to get away from the brutal Midwest winters. Heated pool and hot tub are nice. Great to sit poolside in the sun even on cool sunny days. We've been repeat customers Jan-Mar. ever since. Far enough away from the Strip to avoid the tourists. Very convenient to reasonable gambling and economical food. Very friendly bunch of other Snowbirds.</p><br>would've given it 5 stars, but......<p>i can't say anything negative about the appearance, location, quality, or value of this place. the only reason why it didn't get 5 stars is because on 2 separate occasions, housekeeping came into our room unannounced (i mean no knocking, no "housekeeping, may i come in", NOTHING. just walked right in). might i add, that we had placed the DO NOT DISTURB sign on the door the minute we arrived, and it was still there when we left 5 days later. if housekeeping entered twice while we were there (which we were not in our room very much), it makes me wonder how many times they might have come in while we weren't! it was quite bothersome. i do feel confident that the discussion i had with the manager will resolve this issue. he seemed truly concerned and bothered by my complaint. regardless of this incident(s), i would not have second-thoughts about staying there again. the location is great (an easy 10 minute drive to the strip). the rooms are big and comfy, and not a trace a cigarette stench (try finding that on the strip), and the price was amazing for the quality of the rooms. we WILL be back. i just hope they take care of the housekeeping thing. oh...and how about getting some fitted sheets? i had to remake the bed every time i got up :(</p><br>GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE!<p>Customer service is a dying art - this place has great customer service, great rooms, great prices and wonderful pool area!</p><br>Excellent choice of hotel! Great rate, great service, great location!<p>I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone staying in the Las Vegas area. Whether you are going to be here for a day, a week, or a month. This place is just like home away from home. Very quiet, extremely friendly and helpful staff. We got an extremely great AAA rate here, and the rate included internet access, which is unheard of in Las Vegas. Thank you to everyone at Siena Suites for making our vacation so wonderful. We enjoyed everything about our stay and we will definitely be returning again!</p><br>What a dump!!!<p>The ONLY good thing about this hotel is its location. It was within walking distance of Sam Boyd Stadium, where we went to watch Boise State play in the Las Vegas bowl game.
After checking in, we went to our room to find that neither of our key cards worked. We had to drive back around the complex to the office to get our keys fixed. Good thing they called maintenance to meet us at our room, because the second set of keys also didn't work.
After we got into our room, which smelled like sewage, we noticed that the tv didn't work. We called and were told maintenance would come back and look at it. We then left to get some dinner and when we came back we noticed that the tv still didn't work. We called the office again and were told that the maintenance guy had already left for the night, so they offered to have us switch rooms.
We moved just down the walk to another non-smoking room only to find that it had clearly been smoked in as we could smell it as soon as the door was opened. Not wanting to have to call and move our kids around again, we decided to stay in the smoky room, which also had a faint smell of sewage.
We got settled in for the night on our rock hard bed. I woke up the next morning with a stiff back and neck. As I went to get in the shower, I noticed that our towels both had stains on them. Thankfully we had plenty to do that day, so we quickly got ready and left this crap hole.
We came back later that night to get another awful night's sleep before packing up and leaving as soon as possible the next morning. I'm glad I have a good, discerning husband that chose not to tell me until just now about the cockroach that he flicked off of his leg as he was trying to sleep one night.
I would not recommend this place to my worst enemy! What a disaster!!!!</p><br>This should be turned in to Health Dept!!!!!<p>This was a recommendation from others that have stayed here on our football team. The first room had roaches all over the walls, and cabinets. The second room that was givien to us, due to the manager stating that's all he can do was move us. We didnt see roaches but the fact the mattress had saturated blood staind on the beds. This was the nasty, unhealth place to bring your family. People live in these hotels with pets in side of the rooms. If you care about yourself and others. Just pay the extra money and stay somewhere ekse!!!!! I'm not the type of person to do reveiws. But this wasn't cool at all!!!!! NOT HAPPY!!! WILL NEVER STAY HERE AGAIN!!!!! NEEDS TO BE INSPECTED TO THE HEALTH DEPT!!!!!!!</p><br></body></html>
