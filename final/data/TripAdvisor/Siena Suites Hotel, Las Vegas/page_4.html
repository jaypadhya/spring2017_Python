<html><head><h3>Siena Suites Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 4</h3></head><body><br>Old Campus Dorm Room? Military Barracks Maybe?<p>Where to start........a brief summary: unless you're on a very tight budget, GO SOMEWHERE ELSE!

This 15 building complex does truly remind me of my college dorm room in the 1960s, or even more my 1st military barracks room in the 1970s. Think even some of the same furniture was in our 'suite'. It's all chipped, worn & some re-painted poorly. Sofa stained (along with carpet), 3 of 4 lights did not work (NO lightbulbs in them, Imagine that!).

Bathroom: 2 thin, scratchy towels, NO shampoo, a tiny bar of soap, toilet jammed in between the wall & shower.

Kitchen: NO utensils, pots/pans, dishes or paper products of any type.

Other: TVs were ancient, weighed about 40 lbs each & had a unique green tint to the picture.
Wi-Fi shaky, sporadic, slow, frequently would not connect.
Several other guests appeared questionable.......I was propositioned in the parking lot
Thursday afternoon. I understand the property can't control clients, but customers
should be aware of possible unpleasant encounters.
It is out of the chaos of the Strip, if that's what you're looking for. Close to UNLV football
stadium, airport is 20 minutes away.

I will NOT return to this complex and do NOT recommend to most folks.</p><br>Worst experience ever!<p>Despite the reviews that I read, they were mixed, so I decided to give the hotel a chance. BIG MISTAKE! Between the 20 plus drug deals I heard next store all night long, the bad drug deal I heard and the two guys fighting and hitting into the walls (I thought they were going to come right into our room!) and the gun shots, yes, gun shots! And the Police helicopter flying 20 feet above the building (#11), the bright spot light shining down, the filthy couch, table and coffee table, it was needless to say a horrible experience. I was too scared to pack up my two little kids and leave, while all this was going on. Don't stay here, even though is was in walking distance to Sam Boyd Stadium, not worth it at all! Name withheld to protect myself!</p><br>Fantastic staff. Owner/management not so much.<p>Ebony, Kisha, and JonJon were very helpful in mitigating the obvious lack of owner/management investment. It should be clearly stated that the "fully equipped" kitchens have no utensils, pots or pans, dishes, soap, dish towels, or ANYTHING. Unless you plan to purchase these items just for your stay or are in the habit of traveling with these items in your suitcase, you will be unable to use anything but the refrigerator and maybe the microwave. As others have mentioned, the beds are like plywood boxes topped with a thin sheet of foam, carpets ARE dirty, and so was the couch. Awful. Internet was down for days. All around shows lack of care and maintenance.
Room Tip: Lower floors are easier access as there are no elevators.

We were disappointed that the rate to book an extra night at the Flamingo was 3 times the price we had paid for the other nights we stayed, so had to find another hotel last minute.

The reviews seemed okay, and at $100, we thought it would be okay. Not too cheap - but cheap enough.
We were wrong.

THE HOTEL:
- Laundry requires you to fill up a card, does not take cash. Make sure to grab one from reception when you check in.
- I do not advise using the pool or hot tub. We all got a nasty, itchy rash from that.
- SOMEONE DIED FOUR ROOMS AWAY.

THE ROOM:
- My invoice said free Wi-Fi, but not in the room (this could be added if we swapped from a room with 2 double beds to 1 king sized bed, but there were 4 of us).
- Bathroom sink is practically in the wardrobe.
- Kitchen has no utensils or paper plates.
- TVs are very old.
- Beds are horrible: Hard, uncomfortable and the mattresses are plastic.
- Woke up to see the sun streaming through what looked like bullet holes in the curtains.
- There were 3 people staying, but only provided 2 towels (no soap, shampoo, etc).

This place is a bit of a maze, so be careful when wandering around. I'd advise you to not walk around at night alone.</p><br>Filthy<p>Because of the close proximity to Sam Boyd stadium and based on most reviews this place seemed like a decent hotel, especially for a family of 5. We like the idea of having a two bedroom hotel where the kids could have their own room and we could have a separate room. Unfortunately, the only good part about this place is the location, if you are going to an event at Sam Boyd stadium, and the price was pretty cheap. But you get what you pay for here. The entire room was filthy, we ended up buying a tube of Lysol wipes from the Walgreeens across the street and using the entire pack to wipe down the tables, the counters, the sinks, the tubs/showers, and especially the floor in the kitchen area (it was disgusting how black the wipes were after each pass). There were cigarette burns on the thread bare carpet, even though it was a non-smoking room. The couch had no cushion, it was like falling into a pit of sharp springs and splintered wood. The beds were hard, which is like most hotels so not a big issue there, but if you sat on the side or even worse on the foot of the bed it would start tipping and cracking like it was falling apart underneath. The televisions are the old, old, old tube models with generic remotes that have tape holding in the batteries.
The amenities nearby are ok, definitely not an over abundance of choices but they do have a jack-in-the-box and a pub/grill next door as well as a Pizza Hut, a Mexican taco restaurant, and the Omelet House (highly recommend) across the street. There is nothing else within walking distance.
We may just have gotten a bad room but I would not recommend this hotel to anyone. We did not use the pool. The pictures on the website are not representative of the rooms, other than the layout. It is outdated, dingy, dirty, dark, and not family friendly. When I return I will gladly spend an extra $20-$30 per night to stay at a decent hotel.
Room Tip: Get a room on the top floor, the walls are paper thin and the floors resonate every step and creak.

The reviews made it sound much nicer than it was. I believe there were actually a lot of long term residents here. It was not very clean and there were bugs on the floor. The carpet and furniture were worn. The staff was pleasant. I will not stay here again.</p><br>Will not stay here again!<p>The price is nice, but as they say....you get what you pay for. I selected this hotel because it was for a family vacation for myself, my husband and 19 year old daughter. I do like that it is off the strip and we're able to spend some nice quality time. I was a bit concerned after reading some of the other negative reviews, but thought I'd give it a try. PROS: Full kitchen, pool and nice, hot jacuzzi! Comfortable beds. CONS: Stove did not work and took quite a while to get a new one, found a dead roach in the bathroom AND under the oven once they moved it, NO dishes or cleaning supplies but I knew to bring my own. Not enough towels in the bathroom, NO premium channels as they claim. And there was a DISGUSTING hair clog in the bathroom sink I had to take out. EWWWW!! I had the 1 bedroom queen beds. I will spend more money next time and find a nicer suite because I won't be back here!</p><br>Great stay, just not too clean<p>Sienna Suites was actually very good and close to many restaurants and stores so that was very helpful, and for those that want a quiet type of stay away from the city then this is it because its not too close to the city. But it wasn't as expected for cleanliness, the carpet floors, sofa, and beds were actually stained and looked a dirty. The best part of the rooms was the A/C, it was great at the time we went. The bathroom area was actually very good, they get you new towels and toiletries everyday. The kitchen was also very good. I also wanted to say that when I went into one of the pools, I didn't even expect it to be this dirty and unclean, the ground had dirt and pebbles of rock and the water wasn't very clean and I never went to the pool after that day. But in the end, I could say that it was a great experience and would probably go there again since it's probably what to expect for a low price and since I was on budget.</p><br>Great Stay at Siena Suites<p>I recently traveled with my father who has cancer, we were looking for a quiet clean extended stay property and we were very pleased with our accommodations. Not only were the staff at the front desk wonderful but when we arrived late and could not be found in the computer, The Manager "Brian Paulson" and "Ms. Bea" (as she is affectionately referred to as by some of the regular guest) patiently found us another room and up graded us from a 1 bedroom to a two bedroom suite for the wait time. Since my fathers cancer is in his spine they even managed to find us a room on the ground floor so that he didn't have to climb the stairs. The room was a very good size, and was very quiet and clean. We have had a wonderful time and will be staying here the next time we are in Las Vegas. Staff is awesome, room was great I highly recommend.
Room Tip: Ask in advance if you have special accommodations, staff is wonderful and will work with reasonable...
