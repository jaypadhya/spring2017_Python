<html><head><h3>Siena Suites Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 2</h3></head><body><br>The best extended stay hotel in Las Vegas.<p>After visiting and checking out many extended stay hotels in the Las Vegas area we found Siena Suites and were very happy with the place. The hotel is a bit off of the strip, but does not take long to drive to the strip. You do not have resort fees which is nice and you are away from the hustle and bustle of the strip. I have to extend a special Kudos to 2 very special employees at the hotel. Nichole and Keisha were very friendly and helpful every time I encountered them at the front desk. These ladies should be commended for their professional and enthusiastic attitudes toward their jobs and the people they serve. I had the opportunity to interact with several employees during my 3 week stay and I found that the crew that works weekdays during the day do an amazing job; however the crew that works weekends in the evening need training in customer service. After a couple of attempts to get help on the weekends with the awful attitudes of the crew I just waited until Monday morning to get fresh towels and toilet paper. Maybe the Manager needs to have Nichole and Keisha train the weekend crew on how to treat your customers.</p><br>Showing the Family the States<p>We stayed here last year. We had a 2 bedroom suite because 6 of us went to Las Vegas. I will start off with saying this place is nowhere near the strip, and thats totally fine. There was food options all around us. The hotel itself was pretty nice. The rooms were spacious. The beds were comfortable. The A/C worked wonders in the scorching heat. The kitchen worked fine for us. We are going back soon, and we will of course stay here.</p><br>Nice place, nice pool, clean rooms<p>I stayed here for 2 nights back in June, the room was really clean, the office staff up front were friendly and fun, and the pool was great. I did laundry here, they had free ice, the AC was great in the 110 degree vegas weather, and a few stores and restaurants right across the street.</p><br>Beautiful pool. Loud room.<p>We stayed at this property 2 nights in July. The location is great for exploring both Henderson and Las Vegas. You can be on the strip withing 20 minutes. The pool for the hotel is very nice and spacious. The staff was helpful but they simply don't have enough people to take care of everyone. They were often overwhelmed with requests when I was there. There is also only one computer for the entire property, and the property is huge. Also, the floor above our bedroom squeaked at night while people were walking around. The kitchenette was nice but make sure you brig your own pots and pans. Nothing is provided.

Overall, the place was nice bt it felt like we were staying in a section 8 housing project. A lot of people were hanging outside their rooms or in the parking lot. It was a little creepy. I enjoyed our stay but I probably won't stay at an extended stay place again.
Room Tip: Get a room near the pool if you have kids. The laundry area is nice but it's a hike to get there...

The pictures posted on the site were much nicer than the actual room we stayed in. When I first arrived at the hotel, the clerk asked for my credit card and driver's license. He immediately took a photo copy of both my credit card and driver's license. When I confronted him on that, he told me it was standard practice and that this hotel doesn't have updated computer systems. I fear that I am going to be the next victim of identity theft after staying here. I immediately contacted my credit card company and reported the incident.
When we got into our room, the beds didn't have comforters. The walls were extremely dirty and there were stains on the carpet. There was also a big wet spot on the carpet in the main room. This room came with a kitchen. However, there are no pots, or pans. No utensils or dishware.
The TV in the main area is not hooked to the cable.
We stayed on the second floor and it sounded like an elephant was walking around in the room above us. Very noisy.
We ended up finding a nicer hotel and canceled our stay.</p><br>poor sevice<p>the service for extended say sucks the property manager want upgrade the internet goes out weekly sometimes daily up to two days/ vets stay here and it shows the ownership does not look at us a value customers
Room Tip: rake an end room but don't expect the internet to work or be improved

The large-size rooms and kitchen, for such a low daily rate, is a bargain. In two units, two buildings, we had zero problems with bugs, break-ins, or safety. The front staff was always friendly, and Dominique is the very face of OUTSTANDING CUSTOMER SERVICE (not to take anything away from Keisha!) Likewise, whenever we needed sheets, towels, or maintenance, responses were quick and friendly. Saying Siena Suites is pet-friendly is an understatement. Our pets also loved their stay, got along well with all the other pets, and experienced a lot of positive socialization.

If you want to find things to complain about, you can do that at Siena Suites, as well as anywhere else. For example, one reviewer said the manager acted holier than thou, but that wasn't my experience. Bill cares about his guests and takes good care of them. He helped us re-locate to a room with close proximity to the park, which was a tremendous help to me and my wife. Likewise, he respected our disabilities and housed us on ground floor units. Fourteen 3-story buildings is a lot to contend with, so he (understandably) may not always give the one-on-one you seek. But I've seen him work with Metro to 86 undesirables, as well as show great compassion for Veterans.

No place is perfect, especially in Las Vegas. So consider what Mother Goose said:

Two men stared
Out prison bars
One saw the mud
The other the stars

In our experience, Bill, the front desk, housekeeping, and maintenance all get 5 stars. Sorry, got no mud for you... we would definitely make Siena Suite home again. BRAVO!!!</p><br>No WiFi in rooms--WiFi in lobby out of commission<p>Surprisingly large room--kitchenette with two private bedrooms each with it's own full bath. Location is a 15 minute drive to the strip in midday traffic. Room did not have WiFi and the WiFi in the lobby was not working and neither was the plug-in line. Needed Internet for work so one star. If they had Internet I would consider this five stars for the price ($90 on a Saturday) provided you don't need easy access to the strip or downtown.</p><br>Value Priced Extended Stay Hotel within 20 minutes of the Strip<p>From a traveler's perspective, hostel prices per week for value priced hotel prices and amenities.

From an LA perspective, Orange County cookie cutter condo units in Las Vegas, within a South LA neighborhood fits this property to a tee, if you like the naming game. Car Wise: Acura ILX = Inside the car is beautiful with tons of amenities, but the outside of the car, lesser quality metal to paint work does not last.

Good Price. Good Amenities = Pool, Parking, Gym, Full Kitchen, Blizzard Cold A/C a must in Vegas and No Resort Fees!!!! ok two dollars per night, not $12, $20, $25, $30 per night, plus without the smoking smell and casinos.

Stayed here for a week 6/9 - 6/16 and the maid has not serviced my room despite the door hanger outside on day three. 6/14 Maid service finally. Mishmash of old furniture from bygone Casino Hotels of the past. Location is fair to poor, literally, on the way from the strip to here via Tropicana, not a great are.

Best for Solo looking to relocate, maybe Business, when Vegas is packed. Couples and Friends here for romance or fun--stay away. Budget oriented Family this is okay.

Soap, Shampoo smelled great but the towels still reeked of the bleach.

Otherwise you can't beat the manager's special of $249 per week, less than $300 total in the less desirable east of the strip area.

*Building 7 was old and the unit I was in smelled like dog or human piss.

*Building 12 was renovated and had no smell. Top floor unit, no walking noises above you.

*Card Access did not work on 6/14 so I will have to go to reception and get a new access card. I saw this happen to another unit across from me the night before, so maybe coincidence.
Room Tip: All Roads Lead to Rome/Reception. Get a room in Building 1, 2 or 7; closer to Reception/Rome;

They are inexpensive so the service is not the greatest but The lady at the front desk rumming stuff (not the manager) while everyone else chats is absolutely amazing and wonderful and will bend over backawards to help with the limited power she possesses. That being said, the manager has a holier than thou attitude and rarely interacts with guests. The remaining front desk staff should all be fired because they don't seem to do anything or know anything.
I will stay here again because it is inexpensive, has no bugs that I can tell, and I get 3 beds and a couch in a room that also has a kitchen in it.</p><br></body></html>
