<html><head><h3>Siena Suites Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 19</h3></head><body><br>DO NOT STAY HERE<p>We were in town for a wedding. We had the two bedroom. First of all we booked through TRAVEL.NET I had my print out thank God because the front desk had no record of us and it was paid for in advance. The lady at the front desk was very rude to us. When we got to our room we checked out the beds and they were hard as rocks but we tried to make the best of it. We went to the wedding and when we returned there were Roached in the kitchen and on the bed.. I asked for another room. They didnt want to give me one so i had to complain out loud in front of other guest which i hate to do but i had to take care of my family.They gave us another room but it didnt have enough beds so my daughter had to sleep on the couch. my daughter is 6ft tall and the couch was not ideal but she did it . I was not happy. This place look great from the outside but if you stay here well Good Luck.</p><br>the management here is exceptional<p>my name is tom geer - my wife and i have lived here for eight months. i'm a retired military commander...the organization and management structure of this place is well thought out and performs at a very high level. the siena suites is safe, comfortable and a nice place to live full-time.</p><br>My choice for winter.<p>Staff friendly and pleasant. Great place to make new friends. Plenty of space in suites. Nice not to do housekeeping for the winter because it's provided once a week.</p><br>the management is simply outstanding<p>i live here full time. its safe, comfortable and exceptionally well run.</p><br>Great place to spend the winter.<p>Staff is very friendly and helpful. Rooms are cleaned every week you are there. The pool is heated year round. Location is close to locals casinos.</p><br>Great, comfortable place to stay! Good value!<p>I definitely enjoyed my stay here. The rooms are plenty large enough, with a full kitchen and two TVs. Two outdoor pools and two hot tubs. If I had to choose something to complain about, it would be the location; without traffic it takes about 15 minutes to get to the Strip. Overall an incredible place to stay if you're looking for something off the Strip.</p><br>Best Suites In Las Vegas<p>This is our second year at the Siena Suites and we couldn't be happier with our choice. All the staff here are very friendly,helpful and courteous. The pool is heated and great even if the weather is cool. My husband likes the clean grounds, and my favourite is the complmentary housekeeping service! We look forward to next winter's vacation at the Siena Suites.</p><br>Siena Suites is definitely an excellent option for Las Vegas visit<p>This is our second year of spending 3 months at Sienna Suites in the winter. It is our tenth year of wintering in Las Vegas. The hotel is off the strip but location is handy to get anywhere here. It has one of the few heated outdoor pools for year around use. The staff is very attentive to any request and it rates well in all the rated catagories above. We have recommended to family and friends and they have been well satisfied with their stays here.</p><br>what a wonderfull place to stay<p>We come to the Siena Suites, because it is our home away from home. People are very friendly, the grounds around the buildings are kept very clean,it makes you feel that you are at a special place,especially around the sparkling pool, which is heated. Showers and toilet facilitiesare at pool side,which is a big plus.They have an endless supply of towels available at all times.They make us the (snow birds) fit right in.
Thank you management for making our stay here very enjoyable, we are looking forward to coming back next year.
-----------------------------------------THE THORNTONS.</p><br>good value for the money<p>We spent our last four winters at siena suites. The hotel property was going downhill for about two years. This year it looks like there starting to clean it up but they still have a long way to go. the rooms have a full kitchen with cookware, plates and some utensils The sofas are uncomfortable and need to be replaced and the bed mattresses need to be upgraded. The fitness center has two treadmills, two bikes and a stepper. The staff always does its best to meet our needs. If you don't mind taking care of yourself it a good place to stay. If you want to be pampered to spend the extra money and stay at one of the strip resorts.</p><br></body></html>
