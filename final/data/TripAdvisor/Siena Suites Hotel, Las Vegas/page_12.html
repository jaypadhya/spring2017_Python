<html><head><h3>Siena Suites Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 12</h3></head><body><br>Useless to have the kitchen.<p>We chose this hotel last year due to it's proximity to an event we attend. We were saddened upon arrival to find the kitchen completely bare of any pans/dishes/cutlery, etc. Being on a budget we had planned to make our meals, rather than eat out. After sending off an email to corporate about the lack of accouterments, a bag full of all basic kitchen items appeared on our counter half way through our stay. Needless to say we had already gone to Walmart and purchased plastic ware and such. Also purchased an inexpensive coffee maker as this hotel feels a 4 cup machine is adequate for a room that sleeps 6 people. Just called to confirm this years reservation only to find out they NO LONGER provide ANY kitchen items. So unless you have room to pack your kitchen basics with you when you travel, are willing to eat out each meal, or willing to purchase the needed supplies...I wouldn't bother with this hotel for an extended stay. The appeal was the listed amenity of a full kitchen, now it's just a useless space within the room!

The hotel also lacks adequate handicap parking, and unless on the ground floor, is not very handicap accessible. There are no elevators, only stairs. Otherwise, the price is acceptable if you budget accordingly for what this establishment lacks.</p><br>Clean place, friendly staff and good rates!<p>Stayed for a couple weeks. Overall, everything was chill. Front office and housekeeping was really nice. Only thing that happened was the vending machine for soda's kept eating up my quarters... but every time it happened, they refunded me the money.</p><br>great stay great price<p>about a month ago stayed there for week and a half, for a friends wedding, i liked the full kitchen it saved me quite a bit of money, rooms were very clean and house keeping did a wonderful job on keeping my towels and or bathroom supplies stocked, grounds were nice and clean, if i ever go back to vegas again i would stay there, because it took about 15 min to get anywhere in the city.</p><br>Very Dirty and Bad customer service<p>I recently took my family to stay in this so called suite for 2 nights and regretted my decision. I have stayed in several hotels, suites during my previous trips to LV. But my last visit happened to be on labor day weekend and did not have much options of moving out of this hotel as pretty much most of the other hotels were booked.

Firstly, I am not quite certain how many have given good rating to this place (could be the Siena staffs have given the good reviews)

Let me start with the staff and service. The lady in the front desk did not know what courtesy was. The hotel did not have elevator and we were offered a room in the 3rd floor. I have heavy baggage, 1 infant, 1 preschooler + 2 senior citizens and hence asked for something in 2nd or 1st floor. She said everything is booked. I asked her if she can provide some help getting the things to the 3rd floor... she gave a look at my dad and my husband as if why donot you take their help.
Some how I requested another staff and got a room in 2nd floor. When I surveyed the room I was shocked to look at the condition of the floor.. it was so shaky that it really felt like you would land in the first floor if you step hard on the carpet.
The carpet was dirty in the entire suite (or should I even call it a suite?). The TVs were outdated, with grainy image, remotes would not work.
The couch they had in the living area literally looked like they had picked it from road or a bad garage sale. I never let my kid sit on that dirty couch.
The kitchen did not even have dish washing liquid leave alone utensils. The house keeping did not clean nor replenish the coffee supplied for our 2nd day stay.
The rest rooms had roaches. The bed room had cricket. The Bed was creaking and God knows if there were any bed bugs. The first night of my stay I felt itchy and constanly had a feeling something was biting. I asked my hubby the next day and he said the same.
The AC was horrible and was absolutely not working.
The lamps were dirtly and each and everything in this place was dirty, outdated and not maintained.
I would never consider staying in this place. Trust me, If you look around, you will get better hotels/suites for your money in and around LV.</p><br>Nice Hotel, Good Value, Growing Pains<p>Flew in late Sunday nite and needed a reasonable place to stay. New or redone hotel. Great value. Very nice new, clean rooms, but definitely new enough to be going thru growing pains. Got stuck in Reno following Saturday evening and called to get reservation. Phones were not answered and after calling back and someone finally answering phones got a very useless reservation agent who after ten minutes told me they were sold out...Very weird to say the least....</p><br>You get what you pay for!<p>Didn't pay much for my stay here. Booked through an online service. Rooms are clean and basic. Bed is like cardboard on springs! TV remotes didn't work 90% of the time. It appears that there are many long term residents living there. Saw kids toys on window sils and ash trays outside of rooms on the ground. Probably wouldn't stay here again.</p><br>far enough away from the strip<p>When we arrived we had the choice of a ground level suite.
The suites are very clean. All the staff was friendly and helpful.
Lots of choices for shopping close by. Having two swimming
pools in the complex was convenient. When one pool gets
serviced, you can use the other one. Being away from the
strip was more enjoyable on this trip.
The only downside were the very hard beds.</p><br>AC units are horrible<p>Our only complaint is the ac units, maintenance claims they are repaired but all they seem to do is keep switching them around, they freeze up and are not strong enough to keep units cool. Maintenance even went so far as to tell us to move if its not cool enough. So we are moving out tommorow and moving to a different weekly hotel
Room Tip: Unless your room has 2 ac units as some do. plan on being hot, even some rooms with 2 ac units dont...

I've stayed at a hotel near the Strip and ON the Strip; Siena Suites was the best decision I made as far as accommodations go. I won't be staying near or on the Strip again.

-The "suite" part was good and bad: good because I definitely used my microwave; bad because I had to rent utensils! Which I didn't do. Apparently that's standard though.

-Both of the rooms I had (the living room and the bedroom) were great. They also both had TVs! The couch was a bit firm but good for my back. The bed was too. The first night I slept terribly thinking my back was going to give me all sorts of problems... but it was quite the opposite. The bed was fine. The area was quiet -- I fell asleep in less than 5 minutes on the fourth of July! I loved that I was able to park my car and walk right up to my room. I also saw a really cute cat hanging out in the windows of another suite. I digress. :)

-The air conditioners were PERFECT. I kept them at 78 at night, and during the day if I was "home" I'd keep it around 70. A few times I woke up freezing. This was awesome, because I was in Las Vegas on the hottest day of the year!

-The staff: I'd like to say a big thank you to RJ who checked me in and helped me get a laundry card and to Bea, who helped answer any questions I had. There was also another girl who was there early in the morning who helped me with the computer (she had long, wavy hair). Everyone was so friendly and in a *genuine* way. It was clear that they all worked hard, enjoyed working with each other, and took pride in their jobs.

-A shout out to Luisa who cleaned my room the day before my big job interview. At the time of this review I don't know if I got the job, but I felt confident because my room was clean and I had laid my clothes out the night before, etc., etc. She made the bathroom sparkle!

-THANK YOU to Siena Suites, Las Vegas -- I will be recommending you to family and friends!
Room Tip: I stayed on the third floor. If you don't mind walking up the extra stairs, do that. I didn'...

First and foremost, the AC is pretty old (and the building too) and not suitable for a 300sqft apartment. I could not get any sleep when it was hot outside. The bed is cheap, uncomfortable. Cheap bedsheets, not like the photos you see online. Unless you have a good night sleep your next few days are going to be screwed. I got my room changed and had the same problem, so it is not a single room thing.

First floor smelled like foul. Third floor did not smell but not a lot of people seem to be on third floor and it was quite dusty when I entered. My white socks turned black like I wore my socks for gardening. Really.

I never touched the sofa. It was ugly, dirty and had grainy fabric that told me it had all the dust on it, it was torn and all other furnitures were like you would see senior folks giving away free stuff in a garage sale. No exaggeration folks. This is America and we pay a price for quality.

600 sqft apartment cost about $500 per month in las vegas. This place cost $35 (+ 6 tax) per day and brings the total to $1200 per month. This place is about 300 to 400 sqft, paying anyting above $300 is high, granted it is furnished but it should not cost $1200 per month.

On the third day room service person dropped by, but I did not want the service. That person never came after that, I did not care either. Just an FYI for those who need it.

Plastic doors, plastic door frames. That should give an idea of quality. Laundry machine only accepts web card. Web card is $5 minimum, $2 just for the card. $1.75 per cycle, so you dont have money left for another cycle. Another refill? Another $5 and you lose the balance when you leave. Silly matters but silly business tactics.

If all you need is a roof above your head, refrigerator, electric oven, microwave then you will accept it. But unless you get a good night sleep none of these matter.

There are beautiful hotels available all over Las Vegas, sometimes below this price and better quality.

Everytime you enter and leave the property, the road is one-way so you need to make a U turn to get back into the property or go out on the other direction, that kind of sucks.

Staff members were pretty bad with service. I interacted with three of them all of them did not give a *hit about anything. Fourth person was courteous. I guess it all depends on individuals attitude.
Room Tip: Try Main Street Station Casino, even Riviera is better than this place.
