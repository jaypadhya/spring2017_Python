We came to Las Vegas with our family to enjoy the trip pleasantly and happily.We selected Sienna suites because it has kitchen and will be like home for us,But unfortunately the entire trip experience turned out to be a big "Night Mare" with bed bug bites.2 year old kids to adults everyone is suffering with mental distress and trauma of the bug bites.Now Kids are scared to sleep on bed peacefully.After the room transfer also we suffered with the bites not sure how many rooms got infected with bed bugs. 1.Health issues with Bed bug bites 2.All the clothes were damaged when heated up in a dryer with high heat 3.BIGGEST CONCERN -What if Bed bugs travel to our home,car,car seat and stroller and reside at our place who is going to treat the bugs? 4.Cancelled our trip to other places as Kids were badly hurt with bug bites My sincere request is to please take this bed bugs seriously and act on them so that other guests will be happy to stay at your Suites,So that they don't have to experience the same mental distress and bug bites .

We booked the 2 bedroom suite from booking.com here at Siena suites based on the great price they were offering for the suite. Up on arrival to check in the two ladies at the front desk were nice so so just very busy that they failed to answer some questions we had. When we got to our room it appears decent but there are no real comforters or blankets in the room or even on the bed. They use 2 sheets and 1 think blanket as the coverings for the beds. It was extremely cold in Vegas We called to the front desk to ask for more blankets and they informed us they will see if they have any and if so we will have to come pick them up she will call us back, well guess what?? She never called back so apprently they had no extra blankets. What kind of nonsense is that for a hotel to not have extra blankets?? I know were in a recession but thats like KFC running out of chicken. Next the shower curtains had mildew on them YUCK!! I wanted to take them down and throuw them away for them. and last but not least all of us hardly slept not based on the partying based on the hard mattresses they have. The beds are horrible the carpet and the couch felt better. We all left with pain in our necks and back...SMH. The room also by far was far from the strip its about 9 miles out and can be tiring after awhile to drive back and forth to. Will I stay there again?? Not even if pigs can fly will pay the extra money next time and stay elsewhere. I should have just stayed at Motel 6 personally I know it would have at least been a bit more comfortable.</p><br>don't waste your money in this horrible pit<p>I stayed here for an extended time due to a local work contract and the company I work for found the place for me- I travel with 3 dogs, it is hard to find short term rentals with 3 dogs......but let me tell you, anything else would have been better than this place! First of all, I could not get housekeeping to come clean the suite at a time that was convenient for me- where I have dogs and work full time-------so I ended up just cleaning the place myself- it was easier than having to hassle with them, and I bought a vacuum as they would not lend me a vacuum to clean the place either. I had simple requests, such as exchanging the dirty bed linens for clean ones, and that was a hassle too...........simply unbelievable---------this is supposed to be a hotel, after all........front desk staff are rude, telling me I have to bring the bed linens (bedspread etc....) to the front desk myself..........I don't think so...............I am not lugging the linens to the office- it is far away, and it is housekeeping's job to do this. So, they reluctantly took away the dirty linens then refused to give me clean ones, saying they didn't have any clean blankets or bedspreads (there are 600 units here)..............don't tell me there are no linens available. So I have no blanket or bedspread for the night. The place in in an undesirable area also, riff raff wandering about at all times of the night...............if I didn't have my dogs with me, I would not be safe. The police seem to be here a lot too, and many who stay here are loud and obnoxious. It is not a quiet place to stay or have to live. The grounds and surrounding areas are trashy......meaning trash is strewn everywhere- especially broken glass...............it is a dump. So do yourself a favor and stay away from here..................they charge $1200 a month to live in a box with no housekeeping and are rude to you- for no extra charge!</p><br>Good-enough value<p>Based on the reviews I was braced for the worst at the Siena Suites, but came away with, on the whole, a positive experience. I was traveling to a sports tournament with my teenage son and a teammate of his, and chose the Siena Suites because it was the only place that offered the privacy of a two-bedroom suite at an affordable price. The room we were placed in was clean and roomy, perfect for our group. Unfortunately, it did stink of cigarette smoke despite the fact that it was supposed to be a non-smoking room. I went over to reception to see about switching, and they were very apologetic and quickly set me up with another room; however, by the time I got back to our room the boys were settled in and didn't feel like moving, so we ended up just enduring the smell. The other reviews are accurate in that the beds are not great, the kitchen is poorly equipped, and it can get noisy outside--but at this price, what do you expect? I just brought paper plates and continental breakfast-type food, which worked out fine. (I did notice that they have kitchen stuff available to rent at the front desk). The location of the hotel was pretty good for us since we were traveling to fields in Henderson; if you're competing at the fields around the Silver Bowl you can't do any better, since the hotel is right next to them. Overall, this hotel worked for us, primarily because we didn't want to spend much money, wanted some space, weren't interested in going to the Strip, and didn't spend a whole lot of time in the rooms.</p><br>You get what you pay for<p>This was a one night stop while road tripping, moving my daughter to college. I chose this hotel because I didn't need to deal with the strip and we had a dog with us. I was fearful that my pretty little red Audi full of my daughter's things might not be the way we left it in the morning because of the neighborhood. There was a kitchen which would have been nice if there was anything in the cupboards or drawers much less soap and a dish towel. The bathroom wasn't very clean. Luckily I had my own soap/shampoo because there were no amenities that I could find.</p><br>I would probably not consider them again if I go to Vegas for vacation.<p>The property is ok but too far from the action. I have stayed at Desert Rose suites and I prefer them better because they offer many more amenities and the location is very close to the strip. Siena suites is about 10 miles from the strip and the property is outdated. The staff is ok, but there is not any incentives to make me think about booking with them in the future. The price was not cheap for one thing and it feels like you are staying at an outdated apartment.</p><br>Selected hotel only because of location<p>We stayed for 1 night in this hotel, because it was close to the RV rental station where we had to pick up our RV the next morning. We had a 1 bedroom suite, rooms were big, there was a nice kitchen in, but no kitchenware, so we could not really use it. Bathroom was clean, but the carpet and sofa had stains and was dirty, so that I did not want to take off my shoes. We had a room on 1st floor, there was no elevator and we had to carry our luggage up the stairs. AC was very loud, so we switched it off to be able to sleep. Staff at the reception was not very friendly. Even though we staid only one night, I would not go back there again.
Room Tip: If you have lot of luggage to carry, try to get a room on the ground floor.

Granted I loved the idea of the two bedroom/ two bath suite which makes it nice for more privacy. But, they have the worst beds I have ever slept on. I stayed here last year and found the same problem, but was hoping maybe it was just the room we were in. But, it would appear they are all like that. We had several friends staying in the same hotel all in different buildings and they all complained of the same issue. It looks like our shower was recently done and the room was clean but I would have given a higher rating if we were not sleeping on squeeky plywood all night. Think our favourite part was the Irish Pub (Mulligan's) next door.</p><br>Best hotel deal of my life<p>I got this room on a Friday night for $40 including tax on Priceline. Room number 10210. It is actually a 2-bedroom suite. It has a living room, full kitchen, 2 separate bedrooms, 3 televisions, and 2 bathrooms! It was clean and quiet. I was EXTREMELY pleased. Free wired internet.</p><br>Good for a longer stay<p>Convenient for a longer stay, especially if you invest in the cooking equipment to make your own food! For a shorter stay, bear in mind that the toiletries supplied are at minumum and your used coffee & tea bags won't be replaced. Geared for a longer term residents. Some fast food around.</p><br></body></html>
