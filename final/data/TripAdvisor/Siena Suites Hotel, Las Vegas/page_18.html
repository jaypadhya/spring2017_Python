<html><head><h3>Siena Suites Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 18</h3></head><body><br>Good service<p>I give it 5 starts doesn't meat the hotel quality is the same level as 5-START hotels. If I compare the price and the over all quality and service, I will say this hotel is excellent.
I visited this hotel 2 times in June and I found there is no towels in side the room. My wife called the front desk and they sent us towels quickly.
They have a 2 pools open till mid night and a computer with printer so I can print out my boarding pass which usually takes $2 per paper in some hotels.
There is one thing I was not impressed is some mattresses are old enough to throw away.</p><br>MOUSE IN ROOM!!!!!!!<p>This place is crazy! I will just fast forward to 2:00 in the morning. My 6 month old wakes up screaming and my wife tells me to turn off the air conditioning it is too cold for the baby. I turn it off and now it is really quite in the room. 3:00 in the morning my wife wakes me up and says she hears something rustling around in the baby bag where the baby food is. We use our cell phone light to look cause we didnt want to wake the baby and sure enough we see movement. Now I have to turn on the light cause my wife is not just being dramatic, there really is something crawling around. Sure enough when I turn on the light, a black mouse goes running out from the bag and into the other room where kitchen is and under the fridge. I saw the mouse sevral more times. It is now too late go to another hotel so they switched us rooms. (Not easy to do with all the pack and play and waking baby) I don't think I need to say much more but I will. The front desk has a sign that says, If you give us a good review on trip advisor we will refund you $10!!!! I only say this so you know to not believe most of the good reviews. Chose somewhere else. This hotel is not worth the savings and my ticket to the dog house with my wife. P.S. The front desk had a name for the mouse. They called mim Mickey! I know this sounds crazy but it's all true.
Room Tip: Ask for the room with a mouse in it!

We stayed in the room over Supercross weekend and after our first night, we left our room open to housekeeping so we could get fresh towels and a quick clean up of our room. So after a long day at Sam Boyd stadium and a full dirt dusting from the race, we were ready for a quick shower to remove the layers of dirt. Much to our dismay we got out of the shower to find that housekeeping left us (2) with only 1 wash cloth to dry ourselves off with.

When I was checking out I notified the staff that I was disappointed in the how we were left with no towels to dry off with at night, the staff's response...put your review on Trip Advisor....great response don't you think.

All in all I would recommend this hotel to anyone with business at Sam Boyd, as it is within walking distance to the stadium. However Bring extra towels for both bathing and swimming. You only get two towels per suite and if you use them, they may not be there when you return.</p><br>Great value for your money<p>We booked this hotel for a weekend getaway for our family of four plus 2 dogs after reading decent reviews and feeling like we were gettting a good value for what we were paying.

After booking however, I read other reviews which mentioned cockroaches, so needless to say I was a little apprehensive about what we would find when we got there. Fortunately, my husband does pest control for a living and brought "supplies" including small glue boards which would detect the presence of cockroaches if there were any. He placed them strategically throughout the suite and left them in place for the entire weekend (3 nights). I am happy to say that all was clear and not a single cockroach to be found....yay!

Other reviews also mentioned hard beds....this is true!! The beds are very basic and bottom line beds so don't expect comfort. However, I brought our own pillows and comforters, and we exhausted ourselves during the day so that we had no problems sleeping at night on these beds, hard as they were.

This facility is in a nice area with dining and gas options nearby. The property itself was very well kept outside and in as well as quiet. We stayed in a 2 bedroom suite in building #9 on the 3rd floor. There are no elevators so be prepared to haul you luggage if you stay on an upper floor. We didn't have a problem with this and I would say the only downside was taking the dogs down 3 flights of stairs when they had to "go".

We would definitely stay here again.</p><br>Good room at a great price<p>My wife and I stayed at the SIenna Suites for a week at a great rate that included spacious and clean rooms, parking, high speed internet, unlimited long distance calling and a TV in each room with a good selection of cable stations.

Our suite had a kitchen /living room and bedroom with bathroom. The kitchen included a fridge, stove, microwave and two bowls, cups and cutlery for two. The kitchen did not have a toaster or pots or pans. We didn't ask for these so they might be available. Room service is available but we didn't try it.

Unfortunately we weren't able to get coffee for the coffee maker and the furniture at the pools were barely useable and needed to be replaced. The water in the hot tub was a little murky.

This is a large development with 600 rooms located in several different three story buildings.

See more room tips</p><br>A good Las Vegas vacation starts with Siena suites<p>We booked a 2 bedroom suite at this hotel with my niece and her family. When we checked in around noon time the rooms looked clean. The room was not fancy but since it was so inexpensive we had expected this (but not what we got). We left the hotel to visit family in Vegas and returned for the night about midnight. The lights in the room had been off so when we came in and turned the lights on my niece saw a cockroach run from under the telephone down the side of the night stand by the bed, when she picked the phone up four other roaches ran out from under it scarring her 4 year old daughter into a panic. There were roaches in the bath tub, on the bedroom wall, behind the TV and on the carpet. We immediately got our bags and the two kids out of there. We had to shake out the children’s blankets and pillows we had brought with us . When my nephew went to the office to complain the clerk only said ’bummer’ and offered us a room on the floor above us (which needless to say we turned down). Remember if there in one room there in all the rooms. We finally found another hotel that night about 3am where my 4 year old niece immediately checked under the phone for ‘bugs’. I wouldn’t stay here if they offered it for free which is too bad since the room and grounds looked clean and neat.
Room Tip: Read the reviews before booking.
See more room tips</p><br>Excellent all around<p>My family and i stayed at Siena for 3 weeks, the rooms were clean and comfortable, the staff was very nice and the pools were great! Its hard to keep teenagers happy but with big beds, cable tv and free long distance, its much easier. The heated pool helped to. I would recommend Siena Suites to anyone wanting to vacation in Las Vegas but doesnt want the hassle and expense of staying on the strip.</p><br>Nice place, off the strip<p>Everything was excellent. Pool to entertain the children (with good hours), roomy and comfortable room, quiet, no problems!</p><br>great place to stay and great customer service.<p>This place was nice, clean, and a great alternative to staying off the strip. It's about 10 mins from the strip if that is your intentions. Location was easy, we got a 2bdrm and sleeper sofa. The room was clean and had two bathrooms. excellent for our case. I have three kids and there were plenty of space for all of us. The towels were fluffy, three tvs, equipped kitchen. We stayed two nights and it was quiet. No rowdy people. We would recomment this place to anyone with a family. We got a deal on expedia so the price was well worth it. The only problem we had was that the beds were hard as rock. Really it felt like we were sleeping on box boards set on a concrete block. Literally there is no bounce to the mattress. However, me and my family are deep sleepers so it wasn't that big a deal for us. And the Two BDRMS have two king beds. PLUS!!! And they have a heated pool.</p><br></body></html>
