<html><head><h3>Siena Suites Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 13</h3></head><body><br>good pool and facilities<p>My family and I stayed here for the 3 day weekend cause it was close to the strip and a very good rate. It was nice to have a kitchen to cook, we did have to buy the utensils from the staff though which we weren't expecting, but I guess thats code.

The pool was great in the hot Vegas weather and my wife and I used the workout facilities which were also really nice. It was a good stay for the weekend at the right price.</p><br>Decent stay, but could be much better...<p>We stayed here for over 2 weeks as we got a great deal on the price. Booking.com charged us $200 just for a weekend(memorial wkend.) And we didnt mind because of the long weekend and we wanted to keep it cheap. We then decided to stay longer, again checked booking.com and they wanted over $450 for the week. Instead of booking through the website, we went directly to the front desk and got a week stay for $250! A big saving of $200 just for a week. My advise is if people want to stay, ring the hotel direct and you should get it for this price.

The room we got a 1 bed apt, with a full kitchen in it. But there is nothing in the kitchen only a coffe pot, a microwave and a oven. No spoons, folks, etc. You would need to bring these with you if staying. Or you can buy them at the reception. If staying longer than a week,a month yuo'd pay deposit for the kitchen stuff and get it refunded to you at the end.

They do have 2 swimming pools, 1 heated, 1 cold and a hottub at each location. The gym is ok as well. he pool and area could be cleaned up a bit more. But then again it is an extended stay hotel, and people do live here. The people who do live here could respect it a lot more for people staying in the hotel.
We found 2 different people smoking and drinking coffee and beer while in the pool. And there is a Romanian family with a few kids staying here and they have little respect for the property and people staying here as well. You hear them before you see them.. They dont even have any proper swimwaer as they swim in their full clothes. And they use the restrooms as their changing rooms that nobody else can use. My girlfriend went to use the bathroom and couldnt as they had it filty with their clothes. They stuffed their clothes into the paper holder in the room and had locked off a toliet only for their use.. They just dont care. I think this lets the hotel down badly..

Another thing we found strange is if you stay for 6 days you get full room service for the 6 days,if you stay for 7 days you get room cleaning only for 1 day!! If you want extra toilet papaer and fresh towels you might go to the front desk yourself..

The management could do with controlling people a bit better for others staying here.
That said if or whenever we return to vegas we would stay here again no probelm, we stayed over 2.5 weeks in total.
Room Tip: Ask for room near the pool and somewhere close to where you can park your car, as the place is quite...

Absolutely the worst beds ever creaking when you get in or out and very uncomfortable. The carpet looked ok, but walk on it barefooted and it was filthy. The location said Las Vegas, but it was easily 20 miles from anywhere we wanted to go -- I think it is 'fringe' Las Vegas aka Henderson! Would not stay there again.</p><br>Great experience at a reasonable price. Recommended.<p>We stayed here during our first and last nights in Las Vegas (traveled to AZ and UT in between). We had a great experience both times. Rooms were very modern and clean, service was prompt and friendly, and price was very reasonable (for two bedrooms with comfortable king beds and two bathrooms, plus a full-sized galley kitchen). I highly recommend it.

It is an extended stay, so some guests are living there longer than tourists. Still, no problems or complaints.

Ask for discount if you are a teacher or first-responder, as well as the usual AAA and AARP.</p><br>Solid Hotel Off The Strip<p>I don't want to got the strip every time I go to Vegas so this hotel is my go-to when I'm feeling a little more low key and I want to delve into the classic Vegas. The hotel staff is great and the rooms are super clean. You can't beat the price either.It's definitely the best option I've encountered for a nice, off-strip hotel.</p><br>Inexpensive, Close to Sams Town Casino<p>The hotel is down the road from Sam's Town, which is awesome. Sam's Town has a bowling alley, a movie theatre and free live entertainment PLUS, $1 bottomless margaritas. Sienna Suites is in a residential area away from the Strip, but that's why it's cheap. Just $239 for the week...not bad for a large 1-bedroom suite.

The housekeeping service is available DAILY (not sure why people wrote that it's weekly...)

Pluses:

Close to Sams Town (cheap gambling hall with great drink specials and a really good, cheap steak house)

Good location if you're looking to take a day trip to Lake Mead, Lake Las Vegas or the dam (it's pretty much a straight shot on the freeway).

FREE movie channels, WIFI

Front desk open 24-hours

Minuses:

You definitely need to make sure you have a car. There's a bus stop but the bus system isn't very good.</p><br>Solid Price and Close To Sam Boyd<p>Some friends of mine were in town for an event at Sam Boyd, which is why we decided to stay at Siena Suites. We were incredibly close to Sam Boyd and the rooms were nice. Everything you get for the price is the reason I give this property 5 stars. The pool, spa, kitchen, and exercise room are all nice. Staying for a week at Siena Suites saved us hundreds of dollars. I would definitely stay again.</p><br>Welcome drug dealers and addicts<p>Do not stay here. Grounds look attractive. 3 floors in all complexes, no elevators. No security.
Couch looks and smelled like it came from 3 years under a freeway bridge. First warning; was told at check in that housekeeping is once a week. I bought groceries on the way because
of the kitchenette. I put the first bag on the counter and was greeted by COCKROACHES
running across the stove and counter. I looked down at the floor to observe baby roaches running all over. The bath room had bug bits all over and what looked like blood stains in the
bath laminate.
I pulled the stove and the fridge out from the wall only to find complete filth and many dead and alive bugs. I took pictures. There were characters outside watching me come in and out of my car. This was between 2:00 and 5:00 AM. Looking at the door and window, it would only take a
push of the hand to break in. Good thing I did not stay with my laptops and printers. I am still upset and have the creeps about it. Took a week for a refund on my credit card.
Room Tip: Stay at Tuscany Suites 955 E.Flamingo Rd L.V. NV. 89169. Been there many times for extended stays ov...

The reviews were trending up for this property and we got a very good weekly rate so decided to give it a go. There are very few places we will never return to and Siena Suites just made the list at position #1. We were located in room 4112-and it had roaches. In the living area were the oldest sofa and TV probably still in existance. Bed was extremely hard. You get NO maid service at this dive as well. There are no dishes or cookware in rooms-manager told us because of health regulations which is lie, because other extended stay hotels in Las Vegas offer these items ( just as well, would not want to use utensils that had roaches crawling on them anyway). There are plenty of other extended stay options in Vegas-stay at any of them over this place!</p><br>Odd Mix<p>Nice grounds and beautiful pool/spa area. Wish I could say the same about the interior areas. Rooms are small and dated. Furniture was old and uncomfortable. Not a single glass, plate, pot, or utensil in the kitchen. No reasonable counter space in the bathroom or bedroom - had to balance everything on the side of the standalone sink to put in my contacts! Tops of nightstand and dresser in bedroom were fully covered by lamps and appliances. Couldn't even put a book on them. My favorite problem though is that they only provided packets of decaf for the coffeemaker. When I asked at the front, they said they ran out of regular coffee packets! 14 buildings of rooms and they ran out of coffee? Okay. So even though the price per night was low, next time I'm in the area I'll try someplace else.
Room Tip: My room in Building 11 had a terrific shower (maybe redone because now ADA compliant). My friends wh...
