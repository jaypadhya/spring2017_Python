<html><head><h3>Siena Suites Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 17</h3></head><body><br>Clean with a MAJOR Roach infestation???!!!!!!<p>I was traveling with two other friends. When we found this hotel it was perfect! Perfect pricing for our budget but most importantly it offered TWO bed rooms, One King in one anf TWO SEPERATE Full-Sized Beds, TWO bathrooms and a kitchen!! Perfect!! It was the only place we found where one person wouldnt be stuck on a pull-out sofa bed (i know i wasnt sleeping on one). BUT I should have listened to the reviews posted. It's just that some were good and some were bad. I figured the bad was an isolated incident. When I checked in, I mentioned to the front desk manager that I read good and bad reviews and to determine how to make this a good experience. So we were put in one of the 'newer' buildings. As the facility doesn't have an elevator, were were advised that the top floor (3rd) had less traffic. Soooo we took that advice. Being the person I am, I came prepared JUST IN CASE. I purchased 50 gallon trash bags and Raid, JUST in case. Well when we checked in I was absolutely relieved to find that the rooms were very nice and CLEAN!!! so we put our bags down and head out for a night on the town. When we go back after 11pm, tired after traveling all day, we turned in. Lo and behold while I was in the bathroom out of the corner of my eye I saw something crawling.. You already know what it was. I put my suitcase in trash bags and alerted my friends who weren't moved because they had no sighting. As the night progressed we saw MANY big ones, small ones, you name it. I contacted the front desk and they said they would come up and spray (the next morning). I slept with the lights ON and STILL they were crawling the walls. Well my friends wanted to give them one more chance, especially since with the daylight we didn't see anymore. So we left for the day to come back to an UNCLEANED ROOM!! We have no idea if they actually ever came to spray but again we didn't see any critters so I wasn't as ruffled about it. UNTIL I closed the door to my room to find a HUGE roach behind the door. That was it. I searched all nite to determine where we would stay because we had to GET OUT before we ended up taking some extra critters with us. It was such a perfect set up but after the three people in the room any other critters made it a CROWD!! I WILL NOT GO BACK!! We checked into the Hilton and I was so on edge about ROACHES for a while I was just staring at every corner. Finally I fell asleep and lost an ENTIRE EVENING because I was so exhausted from not being able to rest for fear and uneasiness of ROACHES!! never again...</p><br>Nice affordable lodging<p>Had the opportunity to stay here several nights in July. With a family, it was good to get away from the bells and whistles of the casinos at the end of the day.

I would suggest getting a second or third floor room. Several guests left their doors wide open while they went back and forth to the pool causing the bugs to swarm towards their lights. As mentioned in other reviews, although they provided cables to hook up your computer, without wifi we were limited to using the Internet one at a time but it was FREE - no hidden charges, a big plus in Las Vegas.

My only complaint was that they don't match online prices at the front desk, the only way to get the lowest price was online. Found myself booking a room using my phone from out in the parking lot. This doesn't seem fair to their hard working office staff.</p><br>So much better than the strip!<p>Siena Suites was the perfect place to stay to save money, still be able to lounge by the pool, and be minutes from the strip without spending an arm and a leg. Longhorn Casino, which is right there on Boulder, has this awesome $5.99 Steak meal 24/7, which is the Vegas that I appreciate, not this $50 steak on the strip that tastes exactly the same.

Also, Sam's Town and Eastside Cannery are right there and I didn't feel like had to battle a ton of tourists to enjoy myself. The rooms were clean, nice, and relaxing. I never heard the neighbors once, and I stayed for an entire week!

Basically, if you want to save a huge amount of money, not only because of the hotel's affordable pricing, but also because that area of Vegas has stellar deals, than Siena Suites should be your first choice.

One more thing, if you into sports, the Sam Boyd Stadium is walking distance!</p><br>I'll never stay anywhere else in Vegas!<p>Siena Suites went above and beyond what I expected. We traveled to Vegas to stay for a week and visit family and it was a great place to relax and had a great location. The entire family came over and hung out by the pool. They had great service and very friendly staff. We will for sure be staying at Siena Suites the next time we come to visit.</p><br>Really cheap n excellent!<p>I stayed here on the weekend of july 29 to 31st. The check in was very fast. 49 a night was very cheap n u get more thn wht u pay! The room was very clean. The sofa and beds were confortable. The pool is big and like the fitness center. Just see the desert crickets on the first flloor but thats no problem. This place is good for a family adn for extended stay. Defineetely recommend it</p><br>Hmm...okay but somewhat annoying<p>the good points are: the rooms are huge, new (or newly renovated), clean, kitchen appliances work. the grounds are very nice. the pool is big. i had no problem with the bed or pillows though i read some people thought they were awful. and it was super cheap. i paid $30/night.

the bad points: i've come to learn that w/ these kitchen places to bring your own utensils and this one is no exception. no spoons, crap cookware, no towels, no dish cleaning equipment, no ice trays. no coffee maker. bring all your own stuff or you'll be in trouble. they also forgot the iron/ironing board and tv remote.

the management could use a lot of help. rude at the front desk and no amount of charm works with them. there is no ice anywhere! and it's july in vegas. no ice. vending machines are broken. the gym has 2 treadmills and they're crappy but they work.

the internet is an issue. it's wired but not every room has a cable. when i checked in, i was told they were "out" of cables so i could wait for someone to return one or go purchase my own. i refused to do so because they advertise FREE high speed internet. paying for my own cable is not free. someone eventually found one but i still think this is a gross misstep. it is 2011 people! one word: WIRELESS!

would i stay here again? yes. but i would be annoyed by the same things. especially if i paid more than $30/night.

hope this helps... oh, it's not loud. i had zero noise trouble. and there are nice flowers around the grounds.</p><br>Small tiny black bugs, that were not roaches. They need bug strips in doorway and windows.<p>I enjoyed my stay and the bed was great, since I like firm beds.
I had to request a clean comforter, or I would have washed it myself.
The sheets were not for a king bed, so part of mattress was exposed.
I plan to bring my own bedding, and bug strips, since it is the dessert, and I was on ground floor.
There are tons of eating places next
door and across the street. The bus stops nearby. I plan to always stay there, for it was quiet at night.</p><br>Poorly managed<p>Unfortunately, my review is not a good one for Siena. I called few hrs before arrival to confirm my arrival but still they didn't have 2 room suite I booked. The guy at reception was kind enough to give us 2 one bedroom units, but with kids it was inconvieniance than luxury for us. The room didn't have adequate basic utensils. No toaster, 2 plates and cups. What is the point of booking a suite with facilities when they are not offered.

Second day, we came back to room around midnight and realised no towels. I called front desk and answer was "come to reception and he will try to fond some towels" - I had to yell at him to get towels to room.

Next day went to pool and there was no towels. 3 people called witting like an hour... But finally we walk to the room without towels.

Overall, this is a nice property away from strip for families, but POORLY MANAGED" - and I am sure future visitors will encounter same issues we encountered in 3 night stay. So my recommendation is " look for something else"</p><br>Great value, however very basic<p>Given the price of just $45 a night which included tax I can't really complain. I stayed 2 nights in a 1 bedroom, two twin bed suite with my daughter and her dog. The facility was nice and the grounds were clean and appeared to be well kept. They have two pools which were adequate. The pro's: Cheep price, clean environment, nice pool(s), two TV's, full kitchen, accepts pets ($10 per night charge) free internet (wired only, no wireless), no resort fees. The Con's: The absolute worste beds I have ever attempted to sleep on, no kidding they felt like box springs, train tracks nearby and could hear clickity-clack but no horn (thank God), could be a long walk (depending on which building you get) to the main building/front lobby, Only offer wired internet, (no WiFi). Tip to the facility, provide higher quality beds and I would have given a much higher overall rating.
Room Tip: Ask for the first floor in a building close to building 1 which is the main lobby building toward th...
