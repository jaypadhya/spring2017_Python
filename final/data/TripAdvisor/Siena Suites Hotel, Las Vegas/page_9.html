The rooms are spacious and great shower available, problem with this all suite hotel is its location and clientele it attracts. There were lots of drug addicts on the premises and the doors don't have a safe/secure locking mechanism. It is scary for single moms traveling with children. I don't recommend this, spend the money and stay somewhere safer. I didn't sleep a wink all night!</p><br>Sienna smiles<p>Pleasant accommodations, nice pool. Great rates. No wireless, just ask for an Ethernet cord and you're plugged in. Glad we stayed here. Just a few miles from the strip. Nice and quiet. We booked online and it worked out fine. Even let us bring the dog.</p><br>Great Place to Stay! Affordable Price!<p>This is a great place to stay! I stayed for a weekend. It was very clean, they have a full kitchen and living room, which I was really happy to have in my room! The pool and Hot tub were great too! The Staff was really nice and available for any servicing. If you are looking for an affordable place this is the spot!</p><br>What a Dump!<p>When you're looking for a hotel on any of the search engines this place looks nice in the photos provided.
Looks can be deceiving, especially with this place, and not in a good way.
Because we were staying in Vegas for a week, we were looking for a place with a kitchen, so we wouldn't have to eat all our meals at restaurants and to be able to make coffee naked in the morning.
It may have a kitchen, but there are no dishes, flatware, cups, or pots and pans.
Either you have to pack up your kitchen and bring it with you or go out and buy everything you need.
When we first walked into the room the first thing we saw was the sofa that was covered in stains, so disgusting we were afraid to sit on it! The living room and the bedroom each had an old, picture tube style TV, each with bad fuzzy pictures.
Another thing you need to know is that this place allows pets, people with pets may see that as a plus, but not us. There is no insulation between the floors, so if you are on the ground floor you will hear everything going on in the room above you. The people in the room above us had a big dog, when they were not in their room you could hear the dog pacing back and forth in the room constantly. They also did not clean up after their dog when he left a steamer outside, it was like walking through a mine field. If you did not have a flashlight with you when you left the room at night you were guaranteed to step in a pile in the dark. We complained about it and nothing was done. When we complained that the dog was keeping us up at night all they did was go and knock on the door which made the dog start barking and do nothing else.
The bed in the bedroom was very lumpy and creaked and squeaked with every move, it was painful to sleep in.
I cannot think of one GOOD thing about this hotel, we should have left immediately as soon as we saw that filthy sofa, but because in was New Years Eve there were no other rooms available at other hotels. I had made the reservations for this hotel a couple months in advance because of the Holiday, it looked nice in the pictures online and had a reasonable rate compared to hotels on the strip. After we left we found out that this place is also used as Section 8 Welfare Housing, another feature they do not disclose on the web.
House keeping was a joke, they would take the wet towels we threw on the floor and fold them and put them back and on the rare occasion that they would leave clean towels they would only leave enough for one person, not two, which meant a trip to the front desk to get more towels. They never vacuumed the carpet the whole time we were there.
Also, the police were there several times while we were there and we never found out why.
My advice to anyone considering on staying at Siena Suites is to avoid it at all cost!
Unless you love filth.
This place deserves less than one star!
Room Tip: No restaurant or room service, they had a menu from the restaurant across the street that would deli...

We stayed in a 2 bedroom suite that comes with a full kitchen and living room pluse the 2 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms. The pool and hot tub was great, the front desk staff wasn't too friendly. We did have a knock at our door at 9:00 am to asked if we were checking out that day which I thought was odd since we had a do not disturb on our door.</p><br>Long term good stay<p>I was in Las Vegas for a training, picked Siena Suite based on website and the location. Fantastic rate through website, and when my stay needed to be extended, they honoured the internet rate without begging. Note: Kitchen do not comes with utensils as "mentioned on the website", I brought basic pots/pans from home, worked out well. The room was very clean, especially the kitchen. Almost brand new appliances, good neighbors, everything worked, no insects, roaches, hot water was aplenty, carpet was clean, air-con hummed effortlessly coffee maker brewed as advertised. Few gripes: internet is wired in the room and bit slow at times. TVs could use update. Halfway through my stay I looked around similar properties, there are quite few toward Nellis, but as it turned out it was there to prove that I picked the right place. I wake up in various hotels 260 days a year around the world and I know a thing or two about hospitality industry. You can have best facilities/amenities in the world but ultimately it's the staff that makes the difference. On this regard, Siena Suites was a pleasant surprise. Everytime I went to the front desk, I was met with efficient, bright smile and courteous help. Every issues/request was solved promptly on the spot. Morning front desk staff "RJ" really stood out, with his bright smile and eagerness to assist, was highly appreciated.
Room Tip: My room was 2nd floor, faced Boulder Highway, reasonably quiet.
See more room tips</p><br>Very comfortable and feels like home<p>Four of us made a road trip to Vegas. This property is actually in Henderson (about 10 miles from the strip) but I would definitley stay here again. The rooms (suites) are huge. We had a two bedroom (both with their own bathrooms) with a common area (kitchen, small living room). This property is older and could use some touch ups, but overall a GREAT experience. There are two pools on the property, very nice. The price was very reasonable. There are restaurants located nearby (which offer a discount to guests of this hotel). Staff was friendly and accomodating. If you want to ride the bus to the strip, it picks up and drops off right in front of the hotel with one transfer.</p><br>Great Place to stay.<p>We stayed here for the first time as snowbirds for 2012-2013 Winter
months. The staff is super. I mean if you have a problem with anything
they will address the issues in a prompt matter to your satisfaction.
The site manager Bill D.'s office is open for your concerns or your
complements on the staff. We plan on coming back for years.
The desk staff of Benjamin, Bea and RJ are very helpful in addressed
your needs and concerns. Liz and Sonia are great marketing and very
informative to your concerns and needs for your extended stay.</p><br>they help with flair<p>Great place and the staff are very cheerfull when needing to help on the unexpected issue that surfaces on many trips!! The manager, Bill and also Bea gave great service and offered help when help was needed.
Room Tip: all rooms seem to have their own positive points, and the 2 outside pools are well maintained. Exerc...
See more room tips</p><br>Solid Place To Stay For Biz Travelers<p>I travel to Vegas often for work and because of that I've been staying at this place regularly since 2011. I read some of the other reviews about the murder on site and a few other things but in my frequent stays here I've never felt like I was at risk. Generally I have very positive experiences staying at this property so I continue to stay there.

Things I like: In my experience, the room is always clean. The kitchen, which has a dishwasher, stove, oven and fridge is always tidy. I'm super picky about bathrooms, and this place always has a clean bathroom. Toilet, tub, towels, sink and all. The beds are moderately comfortable. The windows are big. The space in the one bedrooms are a good size for a single person. The furniture is never damaged; it maybe a bit old, but in good condition. The staff is almost always friendly.

Things I tell my friends about this place: It's an extended stay hotel, so they have a number of permanent residence. At times this can be kind of creepy, only because it's hard not be aware of it. Next, even though there is a kitchen, there aren't any utensils..something about a hepatitis scare prohibits them now from providing this to short term guests. Luckily, the neighborhood has a grocery and drug stores near by so you can pick up anything you may need. The neighborhood...well, it's about 20 minutes away from the strip. So I don't suggest this place for fun-seekers! This neighborhood also can feel kind of sketchy at times. Especially depending on which way you drive in. The immediate area feels a bit rundown, but just 5 minutes away on the other side of the I-515 it's nice. There's a Target, Banes and Noble, Ross, Nordstrom Rack, In-and-Out, The Galleria Mall, all kinds of stuff. I usually go there when I have to kill some time.

Things I don't like: The internet access is free but it's not WiFi! This is understandable just because of how the place is set up. It's basically a 13 building apartment complex, three floors to each building. Each room has it's own hard line internet connection.

My best advice is don't go in thinking that this place is anything like you what will get on the strip because it is fffaaarrr from it. Expect to have a reasonably comfortable stay for a reasonable price.
Room Tip: Try to ask for rooms on the sides of the building. You won't have people walking past your windo...
