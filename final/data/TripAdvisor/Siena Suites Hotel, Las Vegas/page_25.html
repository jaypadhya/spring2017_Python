<html><head><h3>Siena Suites Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 25</h3></head><body><br>Exceptional Staff &amp; A Wonderful Place To Stay<p>We moved in Sienna Suites in April 2007 & are still here!!! The complex is immaculatly kept the staff are sooooooo helpful especially Bea & Marcos, nothing is to much trouble. Security is on the ball we feel really safe here. There is no undesirables allowed to stay here so no problems there! The apartments are fully equipt & are spotlessly clean. The rates are very reasonable.</p><br>New, but has problems<p>My husband and I were in Las Vegas for a soccer tournament and like to stay off Boulder Highway because it is close to the fields. We chose Siena suites because it is new and right next to the fields.
Plus:
1. They really are suites with a separate bedroom. Two tvs, and a full kitchen.
2. It was clean and it didn't look like anyone had ever used the stove and pots and pans.
3. There was a pool and a hottub which was nice after playing soccer all day.
4. We got a really cheap AAA rate.
Minus:
1. The first day they never cleaned the bathroom sink and left dirty dishes in the kitchen and only left one towel in the bathroom. I would have washed the dishes myself but there was no dish soap.
2. The decor was very stark and minimal. No pizazz or style whatever.
3. The second day when I got back to the room at 4:00 they still hadn't been in with towels or to clean. So, I go to the desk to get towels and they don't have any! At least not folded they said. So, I thought I could get some off a cleaning cart but they didn't have any either! Luckily I had brought a beach towel so used that instead.
I doubt I would stay here again. We really like Sunset Station because it is also a casino, so will porbably stay there next time.</p><br>unprofessional manager<p>We have been staying at Siena Suites since May 06. We have 2 cars which are registered at their office. My husband works but I don't so one of our cars are rarely driven. I happened to notice one day, tow trucks entering the parking lot. Well low and behold they were hooking to our car (that we hardly ever drive) and preparing to tow it away. I understand they have to keep up on abandoned cars, but I think before they go TOWING someone's car off that PAYS to stay at their hotel, they should first check their registry of paid guests. When I approached the manager (Kimberly) and told her that the car belonged to me, she was VERY rude and VERY unprofessional and stated that she would not have them unhook my car unless we was going to pay the tow bill.....I could not believe what I was hearing!!!!...By the way, the violation was that the car had been sitting in the same place for a long time, upon review of our rules and regulations, I found NOWHERE in it did it state you have to move your car around in the parking lot . Although there are numerous "work" trailers parked everywhere, taking up 3-4 spots at a time, it was told to us, they were ok with that because they knew who they belonged to....sounds like discrimination to me!!! In my opinion they need to replace that manager before they end up in a lawsuit.</p><br>Find another Place<p>Be aware, this place presents itself as a fully equiped extended stay hotel. It actually has only the BARE essentuals, not even as much as you would find in a Motel 6. Coffemaker but no coffee or filters, NO hairdryers, NO basic paper supplies, Towels napkins etc., NO dishsoap, dishtowel, sponge etc. You must bring everything with you and then haul it up to the 3rd floor, (no elevators). The front desk seemed polite when we first tried to check in at 4:30 and our room still wasn't ready, (not the room type I had reserved but the only one available) but when they were asked for some very basic supplies we were treated very rudely. Additionally the immediate neighborhood Siena Suites are located in is very unsavory and not anywhere you would want to let kids out of the room. The walls are paper thin and we were treated to a 3 hour drunken rampage by a screaming long-term tenant out first night there. There are lot of decent inexpensive places to stay in Vegas, find one of those.</p><br>No room service!<p>Horrible! First off its not Minutes from the strip... more like 25 minutes from the strip. Very deceiving! When we got there the front clerk was very nice. Props to that guy. Rooms were ok... not bad for the price. But room service was horrible. We tried getting extra towels in the room. They rudely told us to come up to the office to get it. Never have I had such horrible room service. Would never ever stay there again.</p><br>Overbooked!<p>How did the family vacation we had been looking forward to turn into such a fiasco? Overbooking by Siena Suites.

I'm looking at my confirmation receipt that states, "Your reservation is guaranteed for late arrival with a MasterCard." Yet, when we went to check in on Friday before noon (we hoped we could check in early and drop off our suitcases prior to attending an event), we were informed that they had overbooked for the weekend. Our two-bedroom suite with a king-sized bed in one room and two double beds in the other had apparently been given to someone else.

The desk clerk apologized for Siena's mistake and offered us two, one-bedroom suites at the same price as our other room. The problem is that we have four kids, ages 3 to 13. We chose this hotel/motel because it allowed my wife and I to share the king-sized bed in one room and the kids to double-up in the double beds in the other room. Not only did the one-bedroom suites only have a king-sized bed (tough to fit four kids in one bed), but they were on different floors. When I asked about having a rollaway bed or two, I was informed that they didn't have rollaways--not that one wasn't available, but that they didn't offer them at the establishment. Well, looking at the information that I printed off the Siena Suites' website last week, I see that it specifically states that "Rollaway beds available--Charge is (dollars) 10.00." When my wife asked why it was on their website when they didn't have any, one of the workers in the office said that they didn't have cribs, either, although they were also offered on the website.

The desk clerk offered us a refund if we didn't want to stay in the suites, but what were our alternatives? It was Thanksgiving weekend and we were in town for a baseball tournament. We had originally booked rooms at a different hotel, but cancelled them when we found out about the two-room suites at Siena Suites. Continuing to attempt to be helpful, the desk clerk offered to have their security person keep an eye on the room that the kids would be sleeping in. Are you kidding me? They can't take care of a confirmed reservation and they think I am going to trust them to watch my kids? Instead of all being in one room or having my wife and I in one room and the kids in the other, my wife stayed in one room with two of the kids and I stayed in the other with our other two kids. Instead of sleeping in a king-sized bed with my wife on the first floor, I slept on the couch in a room on the second floor. And about that security--it would have been nice to have had them around when someone was pounding on multiple doors at 4:00 a.m. and loudly looking for "Buddy."

Unfortunately, things that sound too good to be true often are; this is the case with the Siena Suites. I wonder what would have happened if we had waited until Friday afternoon to check in? I doubt there would have been anything available and we would have been scrambling for a place to stay.

By the way, my positive impression of the desk clerk disappeared when I went to check out. Another desk clerk assisted me while the first desk clerk assisted another patron with a request. When the other patron left, the first desk clerk began to complain to the other desk clerk about how picky the patron was; this was while the desk clerk was still assisting me. How tacky. Anyone who has every worked in a service-related business knows that this is inexcusable.</p><br>Don't Stay Here Either<p>When we stayed here for the Superkart Nationals, the rooms were nice, but on the Sunday when we came back from the race the rooms were not even cleaned. My husband had to go down to the office to get towels, the front desk did not even offer to clean their room. My advice don't book a room here.</p><br>Service better, but...<p>I have been here two months and will stay until the end of the year. rooms are good and clean, pool is good and staff is pretty good depending on who you talk to. First night floor above me squeeked and they moved me to the top floor. The TV was snowy and they prommised to fix it. after a week and three complaints they moved me to another room and it is perfect. My only complaint is the TV service NO FOX NEWS, MSNBC, or CNBC, Only CNN and CNN headline news. They will not even talk about getting other channels. They raised prices 60.00 a month to give you free long distance service, which I have free on my cell phone. But, compaired to the other extended stays in Vegas, they are the best for the money. Some close by are really bad and the same money. Closer to the strip there are better ones, but much higher prices.</p><br>Loved Siena<p>Reading one of the previous reviews scared me. But, when I got there...the room was better than I expected. We got a 2 bedroom, 1 king, 2 double beds abd a couch. We had a very enjoyable stay. Pool was great. Hotel is only a few years old, so you cant go wrong with that. Will def. stay there again next time.</p><br>Wonderful stay!!! family hotel<p>Siena Suties is a wonderufl hotel, the rooms were very well kept as well as the property. It is wonderful that they take pride in their hotel! I had a little problem when i checked in, however the staff and management were VERY helpful in solving the situation. They were all very nice and profesional people, i was very impressed with the management. I would recomend Siena Suites to any that is going to Las Vegas NV.</p><br></body></html>
