<html><head><h3>Siena Suites Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 10</h3></head><body><br>Great place to stay with kids.. very clean.. very friendly..<p>I was a little bit weary of this place just because of the bad reviews but I decided to stay anyways due to the price.. let me just say that I had a great stay.. the rooms were very spacious and I didn't feel like I was in a hotel.. I felt like I was in an apartment.. there was a living room with a full size kitchen plus 2 bedrooms with king size beds.. I was travelling with children and it was nice for them to have their own room.. the mattresses on the beds appeared to be brand new and were not hard like everyone said.. they were actually comfortable and I slept great.. the kitchen was surprisingly very clean.. the whole suite was clean.. the only thing that was a little dirty was the couch but it wasn't bad just a little stained.. in all I had a great stay and I would definitely stay here again.. 10mins from the strip but the suite is too much of a great value to pass up.. I would definitely recommend this place to everyone..</p><br>Trip to Vegas<p>Were refered by friend. A bit out of center of town, but really cheap, really clean, really large appartment. Good and friendly service. Free calls in USA and Canada. Services nearby. Good choice to spend little money on hotel.</p><br>False advertising<p>My family and I booked a 2-bedroom, 2-bath suite at Siena Suites (through booking.com) over Presidents Weekend because they advertised free internet, no smoking rooms, and most importantly, photos showing nicely-stocked kitchens (dishes, pots & pans, etc). When we entered our "non-smoking" room, not only were we were bowled over by the putrid stench of cigarette smoke, but we couldn't believe that every drawer and cupboard in the kitchen was 100% empty, and neither bathroom had a shower curtain!

When we called the front desk to complain, we were told that someone from housekeeping could spray air freshener in our room to cover up the smoke smell (there were no other "non-smoking" rooms available), and they'd be happy to deliver shower curtains to us. When we asked about the dishes, pots & pans, they said the health department would no longer allow them to provide these things in the suites!

The air freshener did nothing but put MORE chemicals into the air we were breathing, and the shower curtains were a JOKE! Both were 2" shorter than the top edge of the tub, so needless to say, water sprayed all over the bathroom floor!

By the time we went shopping and bought dishes, pots, pans and utensils to use during our stay, suddenly, the low price of this suite wasn't low at all!

Oh, and to top off this "unforgettable" stay, when we called the front desk and asked how we connect to the free internet, they told us "there isn't any internet."

We'll never stay here again.
Room Tip: Stay somewhere else!

Please google the incident and make other arrangements. Bad area, and now a murder.</p><br>Another Good Stay<p>I returned again to the Siena Suites on another "quick trip" to the Las Vegas area during the President's Day holiday. The rates were quite reasonable versus the gouging happening on the Strip and other properties. I found the property clean and tidy and a very good value for what you receive. All of the rooms are SUITES for the price of a regular room at a mid-range family hotel chain in the USA.
Yes, the property is not near the Strip, but that is what draws you to it. It is conveniently located off the Boulder Highway if you are just stopping through the Las Vegas area, and it is easy to find. You can basically park right outside your room, and do not have to traverse some huge casino. The environment is cozy, clean, and quiet. The front desk is very friendly and knowledgeable of the area. There is plenty of shopping and food opportunities within a short drive along with casino action if you wish.
Overall the Siena Suites is a nice property with HUGE suites that meets the traveler's needs. I look forward to another return trip when in the area.
Room Tip: Rooms on the first floor are convenient for moving your luggage. Be advised there is NO ELEVATOR fo...
See more room tips</p><br>Very large rooms; not a casino so quiet; 3-story drive-up so close to your vehicle; friendly/helpful staff; full size fridge in <p>This hotel has huge rooms for the value; and you are not far from the car if you're traveling. Front desk is friendly & helpful. Maintenance issues: large, heavy double lamp in bedroom could barely stand on its own. We uses our car tools to fix it so we wouldn't get clobbered during the night. The stove was so wobbly that liquids in a pot would spill. We pulled it out & leveled it. Beds are hard, carpet stained & burned. Sink plugged up. Spacious but wont stay here again. If you stay, book online; it will cost you $40 more at front desk, but you can book from your phone in the parking lot.</p><br>Very nice place to stay<p>I recently stayed at the Sienna Suites, Las Vegas. Wanted to share that the hotel rooms very clean, staff was extremely effecient. Ecpecially Liz...she was very helpful and friendly. I was able to check in early without any problems. I would definitely recommend this to anyone. I truly enjoyed my stay there.</p><br>Nice, Calm Place To Stay "Home away from home"<p>I stayed here for a couple days on bussiness, and really enjoyed it. The large one bedroom suites are spacious, clean and smelled fresh. The office was great and let me check in early (10am) due to driving all night, thank you so much. I called half the hotels in the city, and no other hotel wanted to let me check in early. I was so surprised when I walk in the room, it was very clean, everything looked brand new, even the fridge and dishwasher. The couch was clean and fresh and the furniture was freshly polished. Considering it had some recent bad reviews, I was very unsure what I was going to get, a great room so clean for $ 59. The beds were not the greatest, but for the price you pay it was a great value. The staff was amazing with good customer service and accuracy. I am glad he gave me a great location of a room, for a single female, security is important. Overall this is a great place if yoou want a clean place to rest for a short time or even long term. P.s.~ they offer a dish set if you want to cook.
Room Tip: closer to the office is better
See more room tips</p><br>Excellent price, great location, great size room. House keeping horrible, cleanliness was horrendous.<p>I arrived with my husband and children. Easy checkin process. Got to the room. The size of the 2 bedroom was great. It had to seperate rooms with 2 seperate bathrooms. 1 room with a king size bed and the other room with 2 double beds. There was a full kitchen. No pots, pans or any utensils to help with the stay. The smell was horrendous. Drove to the 99cents store. Bought lysol, gloves, disinfectant and air freshners. Got back to the room and cleaned. While my husband and children enjoyed the pool. It was super filthy but cleaned to the perfection I wanted.

Pool- there is 2 seperate pools. They Are heated and has jacuzzis. The pool near the office area is the quietest. The pool further away is by the fitness center.

Housekeeping-they skipped my room the first day. I called the front desk at 330pm to see what was going on. They said they would get back. I did not get a phone call. Called one hour later. They said it would be done. Went to my daughter's soccer tournament and came back. Still no sign of housekeeping. Called again around 7pm housekeeping already went home. I asked to see if I could just grab the vacuum instead and do it myself and they said it was locked and only housekeeping had the keys to get in. Always call the front desk to tell them to send housekeeping daily. Let them know if you need extra towels or anything as well.

Front desk- Keisha is amazing. She tends to get things done when you need things to be done. If traveling with Children call in advance to request a room downstairs, near a parking stall and pool area. Traveling with children is stressful so minimizing going up and down the stairs will help minimize frustrations.

Shopping area- it is a great location near shopping mall, gas station, grocery stores, Henderson area, freeway, eatery places and more.

Payment- I thought that the payment was either charged ahead of time or after we had stayed there but payment is taken the day you check in via cash or credit card.

Kitchen- there is NO pots, pans, cups, spoons or anything for cooking. There is a refrigerator, microwave and stove. Make sure to plan your meals ahead of time or take anything that you may need to prepare the meals you will eat.

T.V.'s- they need to be updated. It was disappointing to watch NFL football on older bulky television but grateful that we had 3 televisions. One in each bedroom and then another in the living room area.

Living room- good size to mingle. Couch was disgusting. Looked like someone threw up on it. Used a sheet to cover it after it was sanitized and disinfected so we could sit, mingle and watch t.v.

The drive is not far from the strip. Sunset casino is down the road. Great price, great size. Just be prepared to do some cleaning and sanitation.</p><br>A good place out of town<p>The price was right and I was not interested in the Las Vegas Strip, but stayed in the area for the surrounding nature and because I has to fly out of the airport. So for me it was no problem to stay way outside the action. The location itself is quite nice, front-desk was matter of factly, i.e. courteous and professional. The suite was spacious, the kitchen was just bare essentials, no way you could prepare food without bringing all the necessary utensils. Housekeeping was sporadic and erratic, even with the sign "Maid service please" at the outside of the door, nobody came and the towels were not changed and the bed not made. It was okay, but next time I stay someplace else.</p><br></body></html>
