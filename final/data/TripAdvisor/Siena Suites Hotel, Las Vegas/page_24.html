<html><head><h3>Siena Suites Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 24</h3></head><body><br>Reasonable extended-stay hotel<p>I stayed at the Siena Suites for 11 days. The room was very clean and comfortable, the laundry facilities were great and the parking was convenient. I didn't use the pool, but it looked very nice and well-maintained.

The staff was very helpful. At one point in my stay I asked to be moved to a room closer to the main office. They were happy to honor my request.

The hotel provides only enough dinnerware and dishes for 2 people, so bring extra if traveling with a family. The wireless signal was spotty and the connection was a bit slow.</p><br>the best extended stay in vegas<p>We lived in Las Vegas for 10 months. 3 of those months where at Sienna. I must say Sienna was the best by far of the different x- stays in Vegas. If your looking for the Ritz, keep looking, but if youre looking for a nice, safe, clean place to stay in Vegas, it is very hard to beat. Not the cheapest, but you get what you pay for. 10 minutes from strip or downtown, beautiful grounds, pool, workout room, etc. If you are just starting out in vegas, and on a tight budget, or just visiting, you cant go wrong!</p><br>Loved Siena Suites<p>We requested a pool side room and were told at check in that we would have one. When we got to the room we discovered it was not pool side. Called the front desk and they were more than happy to give us a pool side. Very sorry for the mix up and happy to accommodate our request. The room was clean and quiet. Pool was very quiet in the early morning and late evening. Great for relaxing and star gazing. Would recommend to others, however a rental car an asset when staying at this location. We will stay here again.

Ontario Canada</p><br>no problems<p>I cant understand all the negative reviews. We stayed for one night in a 2 bedroom/2 bathroom/living area/kitchen suite. The price was unbeatable. Its a bit out of the way but suited our needs perfectly.</p><br>Enjoyed Our Stay Here Very Much!<p>I don't know why this hotel has so many bad reviews because this place was great. The place is being revovated (sp?) but our room was great. We had a third floor which had a great view. The staff was great. We had a trailer and they were nice enough to block off parking places for us because we were coming in late and would need them to park. I would recommend to anyone.</p><br>Don't Stay Here!<p>We were told that this hotel was close to the Sam Boyd Stadium which we were coming to for the Pioneer Bowl. It is an easy 10 minute walk. Stay on the street, do not walk through the park at night.
When we opened the door to the room, we were met by a very disgusting smell. This is not a classy place to stay. the bathroom towels had holes in them. The overall condition of the room was not acceptable.
We found out that this hotel rents the rooms out by the day, week, month or year. We will closer into town next visit.</p><br>Keep looking<p>Stayed three nights. Right on Boulder highway. Noisy and cheaply built. The Harleys rattle the front windows. Get third floor or beware the floors are paper thin. The beds are the cheapest bedding you could imagine. You have a high risk of being dissapointed.
This motel is only two years old and already shows the wear. If you want cheap this is it but if you are used to something a little better look out this isn't it. I'm not usually this negative but I get cranky at 4:00 am after little sleep.</p><br>canceled our booking<p>I had made a reservation for a two bedroom suite for myself and another couple. We booked this hotel as it was within walking distance to Sam Boyd stadium, and we were attending an event there.
Three days before our departure, the hotel called to say our room would not be inhabitable due to "water damage" and that we'd been booked into a hotel 6(!) miles away in Henderson, and only into one room with two beds! I tried to argue that one room with two beds was not the same as a two bedroom suite, but to no avail. Since everything else in the area is sold out or over $300+ a night, we're forced to bunk up together, ruining our relaxation, plus we'll have to fight traffic for the event.

Avoid this property at all costs.</p><br>do not stay here<p>This used to be a nice place to stay. They have now decided to allow pets. This would be fine except they have NO policies in place, Pitbulls, Chows, Rotweillers anything goes. There is barking all day all night there are NO designated rooms for pets, so you could go & end up in a room thats had dogs or cats in. There is dog mess everywhere.
There where several problems during my stay, 2 pitbulls got loose on the property & animal control had to be called. There was also another incident where a guy had 2 dogs yes one being a pitbull that he locked in the room, he never took them out they barked and yelped constantly. After 2 weeks of complaining & NO sleep (may I say I know of several other guests who where complaining on a daily basis) they decided to through him out. The management & staff where very slow & very unproffesional. I will never stay here again. It is absolutley disgusting to think you maybe sleeping in a bedroom thats also been used as a kennel!</p><br>No frills here!<p>I knew we were in trouble when I went to the front desk to check in and an unsavoring looking character also came in to ask for an overnight stay. Other guest were also coming in to pick up extra towels. (what? no delivery service?) Marcos informed me that housekeeping only comes once a day and if you missed them, oh well, they would come the next day. The room and furniture was sparse and old looking. The bed was lumpy as well as the pillows. The blanket was old and rough. We ended up buying a blanket because their blanket was gross. When housekeeping called early in the morning to say they were coming in 20 minutes, we left after 60 minutes, and when we returned they had never shown up. Then we asked for clean towels and 2 extra pillows and they said that housekeeping had left and there were no extra pillows but we could come to the office and pick up some towels. I won't even discuss the towels, but if you're planning on staying, I would purchase towels so that you won't scratch your skin when drying yourself. After my husband called them, they decided to deliver the towels and lo and behold 2 extra pillows. The water smelled so heavily of chlorine that we had to keep the bathroom door closed because it burned our eyes and nose! We wanted to leave as soon as we opened the room door but unfortunately, Orbitz had already charged our account and they would have charged us 100% to cancel. This hotel does not cater to those of us with high expectations. Our stay here was memorable...in a very bad way!</p><br></body></html>
