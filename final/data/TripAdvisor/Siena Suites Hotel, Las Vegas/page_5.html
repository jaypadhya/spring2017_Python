<html><head><h3>Siena Suites Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 5</h3></head><body><br>Stay away from this place<p>I have to give one for a rating because I have to,not because I want too.My neighbor had a RAT in his room on the third floor,and we had to get it out.I have had someone try to sell me METH two times.This place shows great pics but you get screwed bad.My room is trashed and I don't think its going to get the things done they promised to do.The person before me at this place really trashed it,and now as a VET I am stuck with this for a year.I wish I would have never moved in this place</p><br>THE BEST AWESOME CUSTOMER SERVICE AND A GREAT PLACE<p>I had great outstanding help in the office with Lilly, Kisha, Dominigue, Nichole, Liz and especially the manager Bill Deyo was very friendly, helpful and was very easy to work with. I stayed there for 4 months and they all made me feel very welcome as if i was home and it made me feel very welcome moving from Colorado and not knowing anyone here. They did a awesome job and should be looked at for raises because it is very hard to find great help especially in the customer service area as well i know cause i have worked it many many years! Please pass on to Siena Suites Employees listed in Las Vegas Nevada i said thank you and a great job done there as a team and i feel that is really important in a company business as this. i have also recommended this to all my friends and family members and even a dating site and on Facebook! thanks you Las Vegas Siena Suites for an excellent job well done!

Room Tip: I love the swimming pool side myself the best, air conditioning worked great, rooms like an apt.

Next non smoking room smelled like an ash tray. Second room had several dead cock roaches on the floor. They gave us a smaller room in the new section (same price). Floors filthy, stove didn't work. Also no daily maid service, staff snotty about getting fresh towels. Parking lot full of drug dealers, and crack hookers.
Parking is next to impossible if your towing a boat or trailer. WIFI works fine, how I wrote this review.
Room Tip: Go somewhere else
See more room tips</p><br>DON'T STAY HERE<p>I booked through Priceline on a "Last Minute Deal" where you don't know the name of your hotel (only the general area) until you have paid. The bed was harder than most floors, the refrigerator sounded like a rocket ship blasting off, and I witnessed an obvious drug deal in the lobby as I pulled in. Stay at your own risk.</p><br>Good Value, Good Space<p>For $160 for three night over the weekend, we got a 500 sq ft suite with a full kitchen. The grounds are well maintained and the pool and hot tub are spacious ,clean and modern. Daily room service was prompt and nicely done *I wasn't sure there would be any at an extended stay. There were well behaved pets in a number of rooms (my dog stayed home this time but I will remember this)

The internet (cable) didn't work and it was hard to tell the difference between the towel and the wash cloth.

This was a good value if you are looking for a non casino alternative in Vegas.</p><br>Clean, large rooms, pet friendly and friendly staff<p>OK, first yes the rooms are not brand new and they could definitely use some new linens and pillows and towels..but for an extended stay property it is clean. Which is super important. So many extended stay properties have bugs or are really abused. Everything in the room was well maintained. I stayed in a 2 bedroom/2 bath. Great water pressure in the shower, the toilet worked well. Also the property is very very quiet. There is an air conditioner in each room so the temperature can be individually controlled. The hotel gets a 15% discount at the Omelet House across the street too..yummy.
The grounds were fairly clean and well maintained. I was there over the weekend and there were plenty of staff at both the front desk and on the grounds, cleaning and security. Lots of people with dogs and no dog poop everywhere which is more than I can say for most properties and everyone kept their dogs on leashes. I did not use the laundry room but people were using it so I would assume that it was working.
The fitness room was a disappointment...the only real downside to my stay. I wanted to run on the treadmill but it was broken and also I don't believe there was any air in the fitness room.
The pools appeared clean and sparkling, didn't use.
The staff at the front desk Lilly, Kisha and Dominique were wonderful. They were quick and efficient at check in and check out. Great customer service which can be very hard to find these days.
I did ask about dishes and was told that right now they do not have any. But they will be getting some soon and will probably "rent" them out. I imagine they used to have dishes but they dishes have moved with the guests who stayed previously so ....unfortunate but that is how it goes sometimes. If you are staying long bring your own...for the price and the size of the rooms it is well worth the money. The best part, super easy to get to from the freeway and NO CASINO in the hotel.
I did feel very safe taking my dog out late at night too...added bonus being a single female to feel safe out at night.
Room Tip: I prefer upstairs there are three levels and no elevators so keep that in mind. This is a HUGE prop...
See more room tips</p><br>It's okay. <p>My mother and I stayed at the Siena suites for about 3 months while hanging out in Vegas. It's okay. Nothing fancy but for $329 a week for two bedroom two bath was excellent. I was in a ADA room which was adequate for my mother. Beds are not special. I wear slippers so I don't know how clean or not clean the carpets were. Pool/jacuzzi is okay, they have two. Gym was super small. The neighborhood can be irritating at times as far as people around. The maids are idiots and rude. They will block your room with carts in front of the door. I had to ask several times for them to stop blocking the walkway. Even after the manager Bill talk to his staff they still proceeded to block my room. It was frustrating to have to navigate around 3 maid carts as a disabled person. Very inconsiderate. After being frustrated with that I wrote a note in Spanish asking please stop. They laughed threw the note down and call me a name I won't repeat. Just pure stupidity. When u ask the maids for a towel or tissue they act like they can't understand or just laugh. But it's okay for a short time and weekly rates make it worth the silly maids. Liz, Bea, Kesha, Dominique are great front desk staff. Ben is okay, he can be irritating tho. Security guys are friendly and keep annoying people off the property. Nice huge park next to property. Ice machines are always empty unless it's 6/7 in the morning. Do not use washer machines in back building (14 I think) will mess up your clothing. Beware of night critters. Bugs come out at night and can crawl thru crack of door and windows. Wifi is now in all buildings. No pots or pans so bring kitchenware. A few long term guest but a lot of them are veterans so they are cool. I would stay again.</p><br>Friendly, clean, reasonable<p>Beatrice! She's an absolute asset to this hotel. I was having a discouraging time finding a hotel that didn't have age restrictions for my son who is under 21. She listened to my frustration and then did her best to make sure my son had a clean, comfortable, quiet place to spend the night after driving by himself from N. UT on his way to south AZ and having to negotiate the detours on I-15 after the recent storm. My son said check-in was quick, staff was very friendly and he was pleasantly surprised that the room was so nice. From some of the reviews people have had some bad experiences at this hotel. But perhaps management has addressed some of the prior complaints. Keep up the good work.</p><br>Worse than Motel 6<p>The room was pretty clean but the mattress was completely worn out. The bedspread was tattered and had holes in it. The staff were friendly but there weren't enough of them. When we checked in and out there was only one person working the desk. The grounds weren't well kept and there was trash strewn about. There was ample parking.</p><br>The best hotel in Las vegas<p>My wife an decided to extend our stay at this hotel an call it home.its not just a hotel its more like your own condo,the entire staff housekeepers maintenance,front desk,landscapers,both mikes,johnathan,carlos oliver,keisha,lilly dominique,nicole Ben,beatrice,liz bill,sandra,liz,brian omg an the ladies an men that do the housekeeping.The entire staff here are never rude aiways patient with the guest always have time to listen an give the guest the answer the guest wants to hear. my wife doesnt want to move.Mr. Luke Siena Suites Guest ps we are still here</p><br></body></html>
