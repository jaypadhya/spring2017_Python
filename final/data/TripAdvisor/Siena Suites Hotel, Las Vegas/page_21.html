<html><head><h3>Siena Suites Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 21</h3></head><body><br>No Covered Box Spring and Stained Sofa<p>We booked for 3 nights at this hotel and the decided to cancel the 3rd night right away.
We would cancel the 2nd night if we could get the refund
The reason was when we want to sleep, we found both beds box springs were not covered, looked very uncleaned with stained (pls. see picture). Then, we wanted to sleep on the sofa, and again, we found the sofa were stained as well.
We reported to the front desk right away, the front desk claimed that the waitress might forgot to put cover on the box springs, and promised to have it all corrected.
The next day, when we returned to the hotel, and found the box springs still uncovered. What they did was just to flip the stained part over.
It is really disgusting, we WILL NOT go to this hotel again</p><br>2nd night Free Expedia Scam<p>We were on an extended road trip (5 weeks), which included a stop in Las Vegas. Turns out that we were getting there on Friday night---Labor Day weekend!! We all know how the Vegas hotels double/triple their room rates for weekends. So I was looking for a halfway reasonable rate. Complicating the issue was that we were traveling with a cat. So I used Expedia to find hotels that accepted pets. Siena Suites popped up on the search. Eye-catching was Expedia’s “2nd night free” – average night price of $62---for Labor Day weekend!!!!! Wow!!!!! I changed my search to include 3 nights, and the quoted price was $93 for Friday night, Saturday night FREE, and Sunday night $93. Again---WOW!!!! I read some of the reviews, and as we all know, they were quite varied. I decided to call the hotel directly, so I went to their website to get the number. I vaguely recall seeing their price as $49 (!!!) per night, but for some reason it didn’t register what Expedia was doing----which was almost doubling the price for Friday night, but posting that Saturday night was FREE. I called the hotel, but instead of asking what their price was, I asked if they were familiar with Expedia’s website offer, and if they could match it---I was told No. So I hung up and went to make my reservations through Expedia for a 2-night stay, since Sunday was listed as $93. Got to Siena Suites and was pleasantly surprised. It is a HUGE complex. All buildings are 3 stories, and I requested a ground floor suite, which I got. Very nice with a full-sized stove and refrigerator. There were pots and pans, and a few dishes. I didn’t really check out to see what else (cooking utensils) were provided, since I wasn’t going to cook. There was a kitchen table, sofa in the living room, separate bedroom---flat screen console TV’s in both rooms. I thought the suite was very clean. The towels were “thin,” but you make do. Didn’t go out to the pool, although we could see it (we were in Building 13). It is located on Boulder Highway about a two miles east of Sam’s Town. So yes, you need a car. We ended up staying Sunday night, and got the rate of $49 at the reception desk. Don’t fall for Expedia’s scam---book directly with the hotel on their website.</p><br>Comfortable &amp; Good value<p>A nice quiet suite hotel in Henderson district.

Our suite overlooked the pool and was away from the highway traffic so it was nice and quiet. The suite has two identical bedrooms each with it's own bathroom ensuite. There was a common living room and kitchen with Range, oven , microwave and coffee maker. Laundry facilities are available in the complex. The bedrooms had plenty of space and the queen size beds were comfortable.

The receptionist (Bea) was very friendly and helpful.
You will need your own transport as its about 14 miles from Vegas central but it is very easy to navigate to.

Overall we were very happy with our stay here and would be happy to stay again.</p><br>Ok for the Money<p>Print out instructions before you get there - we called the hotel and they took us all the way over to another side of town and added another 45 minutes to our already 15 hour drive. The hotel is nice enough. Definitely no frills. It's in a real nice, new neighborhood, so no worries there. Good for the value. Bring an ethernet cable if you want internet and your own dish soap. Toilets don't have great pressure, so flush often (if you get my meaning). Housekeeping is weekly, so if you want sooner, you will need to let them know at check in. To get clean towels daily, you have to call the office (don't expect them immediately). You also have to call to have them pick up towels and trash. Great if you're travelling with pets - nice pet area with baggies supplied to pick up pet waste. FYI - the large pool is shut down temporarily, so the only pool available is a wading/kiddie pool. Reception area has computers for personal use, but no printers.</p><br>My first and only visit<p>I had a chance to stay with you I had come down to see my sister whom lives across the way from you so she paid for the room.

I stayed with you on the Friday evening and only to decided I would let you know how "wonderful" your visitors were.

Attached are few o them. Not to leave out what I was able to bring home have attach to my clothing, handbag, or not us not leave out our skin.

I would like to also comment on when I was checking out after only being there a few hours they were no help. they told me to talk to the manger, and when I wanted to show them my visitors they said they did not want to see what they already knew.

Sleeping made me feel like I was pre 1970 with a bed that was so sot I would sit on it made me feel like I was sitting on the floor</p><br>a bargain.....<p>a real bargain and s was the price. nice kitchenette and two beds. the rooms were clean, alot to offer. pool was great [ it was in the 100's]. the sidewakls could have been kept cleaner due to ice cream and filth on them, otherwise a nice place to stay.</p><br>I was pleasantly surprised<p>Like some others I read the reviews and was scared to stay at the hotel. We went anyway, but unlike some others I found the staff was helpful, we did not see any roaches in the rooms, we did not smell anything even though we were in a smoking room. The hotel was only minutes away from our destinations and we were happy about that. It was only about 10 minutes from the strip.

Now the issues: The pools and one of the jacuzzis were cloudy and other Jacuzzi had what looked like paint coming off. The microwave as well as the tv in the front room seemed like they were shorting out. The "State of the Art" workout room was in great need of repair and probably should be closed before someone gets hurt. They need to power wash the bird poop from the stairs and walkways. Like some ppl stated the internet was down for a time.

After reading all of the harsh things ppl had to say about this place I almost did not go but I was surprised it was not all that bad. I would not recommend to someone looking for a resort like atmophere but for a convention or just a place to crash while on a business trip it may be the place to stay</p><br>If you love to be dissapointed stay at this dump<p>This place has bugs (roaches). The beds are hard and some beds are lower on one side then the other. The internet is rarely up. I've tried the wireless and the plug on the wall and both have failed. Internet is important for my job because I need to log into a work server for work. I have to agree with one of the other posts that the rooms appear clean, but you can tell that the pillows are old and the comforters are never washed (gross). When calling customer service about the internet they where useless and rude. The employees they hire should be screened and trained in customer service. If you need a cheap place and you are totally broke then this might be for you, but I am recommending to my company and all my friends to not use this place. This place is supposed to be around 2 years old. It feels and sounds like its 2 decades old.</p><br>Nice place for the price we pay..<p>To be truthful, i was bit hesitant to go to this hotel after reading reviews. But the stay was good. it has 2 rooms with a kitchen and utensils. here are some facts which i experienced.

Pros: good staff, cheap rate, good room considering price, has kitchen if you want to cook.TV in both rooms.
cons: i did find a small harmless insect in a room, some problem with hot water in bathroom, A/C was bit slow to cool room but does cool down pretty well after about 30 mins.

there is a field beside this suites so there will b some insects in the corridor. but the staff was trying well to take care of the situation.</p><br>Poor service, good value<p>First of all, and I cannot stress this enough, DO NOT use the restroom in the lobby. Although it isn't marked as such, it is EMPLOYEES ONLY, and Bill, the desk clerk, WILL yell loudly across the crowded lobby at you. He will also tell you that next time, you should ask first. Absolutely mortifying. Also heard this man tell a child who came into the lobby, asking for a towel for the pool, "Thanks a lot for dripping water all over the floor". Yikes.
Also, the wireless may be "free", but it's going to cost you $7 to buy the cord at the front desk, unless you bring one from home.
We stayed in a two bedroom suite...one of the rooms didn't have adequate A/C (it was connected through a hole in the wall to the main A/C unit in the living room, but the main A/C kept the living room cool, and the A/C in the second room (a separate unit) kept the room chilly, and that's the room I was in, so I can't complain. There are fans in the bathrooms, which I appreciate for white noise at night. I will say, I couldn't hear a sound from any of the other rooms, so either it was empty, or well-insulated, and didn't hear the traffic outside at all, either.
The pool, as one person mentioned, is dirty. We swam anyways, because it is mostly dirt, bugs, and leaves, not mold or scum. But it is a little off-putting to get into water that is cloudy and green.
The pillows are extremely lumpy...like sleeping on tennis balls. I drove to Target and picked up a couple cheap pillows, and that solved the problem...the bed itself was comfortable.
There are pots and pans and basic silverware, but no dishtowels or dishsoap, so if you plan to cook, bring some, or make a trip to the store.
The housekeeper did a great job...everything was very clean and tidy.
There is a Walgreens almost across the street, and you are very close to the Gallaria mall, easy access to the freeway, etc.
Basically, for the price, it's a good deal. I got it for $100/night, for two nights. I wouldn't pay more than that, but as a headquarters, and the benefit of having two bedrooms and two bathrooms, plus central living space, it was worth it. Don't expect anything glamorous, but for a base for traveling, or if you have a lot of people, which we did, I would stay again. You just can't be sqeamish about the pool :)</p><br></body></html>
