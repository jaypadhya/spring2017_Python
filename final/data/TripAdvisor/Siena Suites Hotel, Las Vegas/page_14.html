Noise from people who lived at the top. the only plus is the price.</p><br>Las Vegas but not the glitz!<p>the staff and chief were great and very attenitive. Place was very clean and accmodations were very good. Price was in line with the apts and grounds. Large park adjancent to the property were a great plus. Close enough to the Strip to have easy access but far enough way to have quiet.</p><br>Very satisfied with the hotel and location<p>Four of us wanted to stay off the strip for a week. We stayed in building 10, on the third floor, in a room that had two bedrooms with a shared kitchen. It worked out quite well. We brought our own kitchen utensils. The room was quiet, clean, with no bugs. The appliances, carpet, shower and AC were in good shape. It may have helped to have a third floor room that hasn't seen heavy use. The mattress was hard the first night but after that we got used to it. Had to get some extra hand towels and bars of soap from the office. Found a couple of burned out light bulbs and the maintenance guy was sent right up. The office was friendly and helpful with coffee available in the morning. Checked out the exercise room. It was kept very cold, take your sweatshirt. The weight machine, treadmill and two exercise bikes seemed to be working. The ice machine was in the laundramat room in the next building. There are a few questionable people in the parking lot from some of the other buildings. I never felt unsafe and didn't consider it to be a problem. I would definately stay here again. We found a GPS was very helpful to navigate around town.
Room Tip: If you don't have pets, are staying for a few days and don't mind the stairs, stay in a thir...

The staff was very friendly and professional. I feel I got a GREAT value for my money. This property is away from the strip, but is close to Sam Boyd Stadium and convenient to many shopping and dining options. I always rent a car when in Las Vegas, and getting around is quite easy using main thoroughfares.

This property is an "extended stay" property also. Don't let that detract you from the property.

I would recommend staying here if you are looking for a clean and comfortable suite away from distractions. The guest laundry area was also convenient for doing laundry before packing up for my next destination. It is off-season now, but it looked as if the pool/hot tub area would be quite comfortable on a warm Las Vegas day.
Room Tip: I always like a room on the ground level in this type of facility

This was my third year in a row to watch the IRB Rugby Seven’s Tournament. It is a great hotel with a fast and friendly staff, closest to Sam Boyd Stadium. My stay was very good at each time I stayed here. Rooms are clean and the land scape is very clean too. I normally book over 20 rooms per year for all my friends, family and rugby fan’s. I would like to thank each and every one of you for making my stay a wonderful one. Keep up the good work. Deven Singh
Room Tip: Close to the swimming pool and on the first floor.
See more room tips</p><br>Fabulous stay!<p>Reading the other reviews makes me think they were staying in another hotel. I have been here for a while now and i cannot complain at all, and definitely have not seen a cockroach. Everyone is friendly, and helpful. The rooms are spacious, clean and very comfortable. Pet friendly which is amazing and something many people look for in a hotel. I am very happy by my decision of staying here. I do not know how long I'd be staying here for but I am very sure I will be more than fine.!</p><br>A Very Pleasant Place<p>I am an extended stay guest and I have had a wonderful stay so far. I've been in building 10 for about 3 months with no bug problems, no maintnence issues and I feel comfortable with the layout of the room. It is very spacious compared to other hotels and is perfect for families. I read some negative reviews below and wonder what they could possibly be talking about. They may be confused with another hotel because I have had no troubles. Thank you Siena Suites for all you do!</p><br>Great Value<p>Booked this because of its' close proximity with Sam Boyd Stadium where the USA Rugby Sevens competition was playing. It is a suite hotel and was very clean. We wern't planning on preparing meals in the room so the lack of silverware or plates did not concern us.
Front desk staff were courtious and helped me get on the internet. They also gave us directions to public transportation to get to the strip.
Our bed was a king and hard the way we like it. Being rugby fans we messed the rooms up pretty bad but the housekeeping took care of everything. We plan to return next year for the tournament.
Room Tip: Building 5 is where our contact placed us which overlooks the swimming pool. It was very quite.
See more room tips</p><br>Everything else was full<p>We ended up here because everything else was full. I'm sure we were too tired to see the imperfections, but it was better than pushing through. This 'hotel' is really a extended stay/apartment facilities. Several scary people working on non-moving vehicles, chain smoking with small children slamming doors, and other early 20's somethings moving coolers of beer into the rooms.
Wifi only in lobby. They have a cord you can borrow to plug into your laptop...too bad if you have an Ipad.

I do have to give a HUGE hand to the front desk clerk Ben....shame on his manager for letting this poor man work the desk by him self with hundreds of guest. At one time there were over 15 people in line and ringing phone for him to take care of. Not only did he gracefully check us in, he was more than happy to give us dinner recommendations....with a geninue smile. Ben...I hope you have your resume out, what ever Sienna Suites is paying you....you are worth more and deserve a higher caliber job.
Room Tip: higher floor. Aviod the back buildings....that were the auto repair was going on. Several toothles...
See more room tips</p><br>Cockroaches by the hundreds! Mouse Poop too!<p>We were three families travelling together for the Rugby 7's. We rented a total of 5 rooms. 2 of the 3 families were confronted with GERMAN COCKROACHES in every stage of life, from fully grown, half grown to babies. The walls, cabinets and bathroom were teaming with them. The sheer number of cockroaches present in the first room our group was given, is beyond words. I'm not talking about a couple of cockroaches. I'm talking about hundreds of them scrambling everywhere as the lights were turned on in the room when we arrived. Roaches poured out from behind the cupboards in the kitchen, in droves. Babies scrambled on the top of the stove. It was soooo gross!

We were relocated to a new room in a different building. On our last day there we noticed a new infestation in that room too. Roaches in the bath tub. We left. After getting home, we were then not-so-pleasantly surprised to find we had been charged for BOTH room. The infested one that we did not stay in and also the room we were re-located to. 1 hour and some phone calls back and forth got the charges reduced.

The staff are well aware of the infestation, but will lie and pretend to be shocked...until you confront them with overheard converstations. And apparently the health department knows about the infestation too. It seems as though they might have forced Siena Suites to remove all cookware and eating untensils (plates, pots, pans, knives, forks) etc out of their suites because of the massive infestation.

While I did not see any mice, there was mouse poop and evidence mice had been in the room. However that was less gross to me than the roaches.

I hate that in order to give this review, I'm forced to give at least one out of five. If I could give 0 I would.
Room Tip: Rooms in buildings 10 and 4 absolutely had roaches in them. Rooms in building 12 had mice, but no ev...
