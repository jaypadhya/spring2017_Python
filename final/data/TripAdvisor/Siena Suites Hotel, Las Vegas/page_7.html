<html><head><h3>Siena Suites Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 7</h3></head><body><br>Affordable squalor<p>The place is quiet, you have to give it that. And, there were two rooms, two filthy rooms. I lived in squalor during my stay.

The room smelled of stale beer and cigarette smoke, even though it was a non smoking room. The carpet was filthy, certainly not vacuumed before I arrived or during my stay. Clutter, lint, and debris littered the floor and every corner. The couch was stained in multiple places. I wore white athletic socks instead of going barefoot. The socks were blackened by the filth on the carpet.

The bed cover (bedspread?) was stained with who knows what. I folded it up and left it on the living room table to expose the stains, expecting a clean one to replace it. Instead, it was removed and my bed had no bedspread the rest of my stay.

The furniture was stained also. In short, the room was filthy.

My room was on the third floor. No elevators.

The good news was that I was in Vegas to work. By the time I arrived at my room, I was too tired to really care how bad it was. I closed my eyes and went to sleep, ignoring the filth.

I'm just glad I didn't take my family with me.

Find a different place to stay. This place is not good at any price.
Room Tip: Please read the reviews. Look for those that disclose conditions about filth, dangers, drugs, drug...

Room was clean and very functional on the first floor and near the grassy area for the doggie. Nothing fancy here. Furniture is a bit dated but our suite had plenty of room, nice kitchenette, staff were friendly and property was clean. We were visiting family in Henderson, so this did the trick but don't know if I would stay here again.
Room Tip: We asked for a ground level room as we had a senior traveler with us. There are no elevators in the...

- the matresses were beyond horrible
- no decaf coffee - when I called the Front Desk for some, I was told they do not carry any supplies at the Front Desk and that I could ask housekeeping for it the next day. Not only did housekeeping NOT replenish any coffee supplies, she also did not wash out the coffee pot for three days
- friends in other rooms also complained of the horrible mattresses, and stains in the carpeting
- since it is also an "extended stay", there were many "seedy" looking people that did not make you feel safe staying there.
Room Tip: If you have to stay here, try to get a room toward the back of the property, rather than off the mai...
See more room tips</p><br>GREAT place to stay...<p>This was our second stay at Siena Suites; we came down here from Canada a few years ago and checked out several places to spend some "winter" time...and after staying at a few places we decided we liked this place, so we booked it for two weeks this January...We could not be happier. The location is off the Strip, which suited us fine, and was still located close to a LOT of good places to visit and to eat. It's easy to access, and to leave. It DOES have in-room internet (not wifi), but that suited us fine. We like that it has a couch, and not just the typical one-chair-setup, and has a separate bedroom. The pool area is well-kept and very pleasing. The whole premises was clean, and felt safe; the kitchen provided is more than adequate; and the staff was very accommodating. We plan to return. NOTE-- NO RESORT FEES...
Room Tip: Rooms facing one of the pool areas makes it feel more like a "resort"...
See more room tips</p><br>Scary<p>Left this hotel to find another. Looked much better on the website and thought it would be good since I had extra kids with me for a nearby tournament. Cheap, long term stay motel with questionable people wandering about. Did not feel comfortable here. Ok if you need a kitchen and a lot of beds (although they are rock hard). Wifi is only in the lobby if that is a concern for you. Front desk staff were nice and friendly though.</p><br>Good for the Price<p>Traveled to this hotel the first weekend of April 2013 to attend the ACM Experience and Concerts at The Orleans. This Hotel was the only place that allowed us to check in at 18 (Most require you to be 21) and when I called to get more information the staff was very helpful. We arrived around 2pm and were immediately given access to our room. The building we stayed in was at first difficult to find. There is plenty of parking! Our room was on the second floor, and had a pool view. There is WIRED internet access if you ask, but wifi is only available for the suites.There was a private bathroom, kitchenette(with stove, microwave and fridge) , fully functional TV, and two A/C /Heating units (one in the bedroom and one in the sitting area). Everything worked as needed, there is an ironing board and hair dryer, and plenty counter space for girls with a lot of toiletries.
Now to the downside, we stayed across from quite the noisy neighbors, so our first night was a hard nights sleep. The walls are really thin, but the staff is very helpful and if you request to be moved they will do everything they can to accommodate you. We didnt use the pools or gym or any of that, we used it basically just to sleep and get ready.



Overall it was a good place to stay and I am already working with a representative to get a good deal to book for this April!</p><br>Two Stars? Really?<p>Stayed here because it was within walking distance of Sam Boyd Stadium (we could see the stadium from our front door), and they accepted dogs. We had a great time: the room was clean and fresh smelling, the staff were friendly and happy to help, and our team won. The rooms are not huge, but were a comfortable size, and the air / heat worked well. I advise staying on the top floor, as it will reduce noise. I am really puzzled why the hotels is rated at only two stars, at least three to me. The only drawback is the total absence of any silverware, plates, pots and pans in the kitchen. All in all, a great stay.</p><br>nice place to stay<p>this was our 2nd 2 week vacation at Siena Suites the staff were friendly and helpful and nothing was to much trouble for them Beatrice and Ben and rest of the staff were very nice we will stay there again if we visit with family. would be nice if there was plates cups ect .as traveling from the UK we have had to buy it and leave it behind.on both visits, P . A.EASTWOOD UK
Room Tip: corner rooms are less noisy
See more room tips</p><br>Great Honesty<p>Stayed there the weekend of 11/2, we left a cash box in the room, realized our mistake, called hotel. Room service have found the box, and turned it in to manager. There was a good amount of cash. Not penny was missing. I had to talk them in to accepting a reward. I won't sty anywhere else in Vegas.</p><br>Great place for long term<p>I have stayed in many extended stays in my travels and this is the best. If there is a problem, the employees strive to correct it. We got a non smoking room and it was clean! I complained about the bed and got a new one. Also, got a new a/c unit because of a noisy one. Our building is very quiet and we get great sleep.

The Operations Manager, Bill Degos, went out of his way to be sure we were comfortable.</p><br></body></html>
