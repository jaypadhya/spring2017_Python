<html><head><h3>Siena Suites Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 22</h3></head><body><br>BUGS BUGS &amp; MORE BUGS<p>OMG This is the worst hotel I have EVER stayed in.
I had roaches I mean hundreds of roaches outside the room in the room everywhere.
I went and complained to the reception they offered me another room, I asked them to spray & I was told they didn't have any!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
While I was in the office several guests from the same party where screaming they had BED BUGS, you could visably see the bites, that was enough for me I checked out there & then. PLEASE DON'T STAY HERE IT'S FILTHY.</p><br>Our stay was Ok. Kids really liked the pool and I liked the fact there was a kitchen!<p>When we got to the room we noticed some problems. We informed the staff and they said they would fix immediately but nothing was done. On the 2nd day we informed them again and nothing got done again until I called the manager that evening!! He did come right up and fixed the problems but told me they dont do any credits or refunds!! Not real pleased with that but the stay was ok, I just feel a paying customer should come first and not have to wait till management is informed!!</p><br>Unless you like sleeping on cement don't stay here<p>Let me start out with the good. Each room has two bathrooms and it is close to Sam Boyd Stadium. We checked in at 6:00am and took showers but the maids did not come in that day because we had just checked in and didn't need clean towels for the next morning. They did not leave additional coffee when we used the small packet. No creamer in the room. The king bed was like sleeping on a cement slab and the double beds had the springs sticking up. The hot tub was cloudy. There are 3 stories to each building and no elevator so be prepared to carry all your luggage up the stairs. We were on the third floor. Never again.</p><br>place to stay !!!!<p>If you are staying in Las Vegas for a week or so then we highly recommend staying here. Nothing is too much trouble. The apartment as very clean, spacious and with a great fully equipped kitchen. The swimming pools are large and clean. Also there are many food outlets within walking distance. We stay many weeks a year in Las Vegas and by far this was the best weekly stay that we have experienced with great value for money.</p><br>Stay away from-- If you can<p>Checked in late on a Wednesday night. The clerk took 20 minutes of computer typing to get get the room then had to send security to ensure the computer was correct.
(It wasn't) Went back, got the right room but it was a smoking room (non-smoking reserved) Carpet in room was filthy. A/C unit had bad fan that was as squeaky as a .......you get the point. This facility is proof that vice presidents are overpaid,
half braindead frat boys that care more about there empty hollow and meaningless words than there actions. Stay away from this facility at all cost unless you and yours are desperate. I would not recommend this facility to my worst enemy......well maybe I would to him.</p><br>Cable and internet access sucked. Worst hotel ever<p>We were told we rented a room that was in a "totally" non smoking building just to discover after check in we could not open windows for fresh air. Guests who smoke were also in this building were told they could not SMOKE INSIDE THE ROOM but could in front of their doors. This was unbelievable. Cigarrette smoke was terrible. The Internet??? unavailable during most weekends when more than 3/4ths capacity. Cable worked for a while then went out.. Called several times to complain and continuously told repairs were being made. NOT.. We discovered by accident that Siena Suites hotel had not paid their Direct TV bill and was shut off but the staff continued lying to the guests. This hotel rents to anybody such as prostitutes, drug addicts who had vicious pitt bulls just to name a few of their problems. Metro Police was involved in a few episodes. Travelers, DO NOT BE FOOLED by the nicely decorated lobby. You pay for everything but you get very little.. I would rather have stayed at the Emerald Suites. The staff is another story !!! Dont screw up your trips at this hotel.</p><br>The Worst place to stay in Vegas<p>I hated this place! There was nothing good about it. The gym had about 5 machines from the jurassic period and only 35 pounds of free weights. The rooms were horribly decorated and the bathrooms were incredibly small. The kitchen had about 1 plate, 2 cups, 2 little bowls, and some cooking stuff. It didn't feel safe either and was very sketchy. I will NEVER stay here again.</p><br>Not bad but bed way too hard<p>We just stayed one night traveling to San Diego with our dog. The room itself was very nice and having 2 rooms was nice but the bed was just too hard it literally had no padding.

The complex itself is huge and the room was not bad but our white socks were not white after walking around the room for a while.

Given the bed just would not come back price was very good but you go to a hotel to sleep in a bed!

We were able to walk 10 feet from car to door but the room while not real noisy our dog barked several times from hearing other people walking around.</p><br>Great place great people and i stayed for a year<p>This was a great place to stay.A unfortunate situation happen to me in Jan of 2008 and i was forced to find a place to stay with my 5 year old,I never planned on staying for a year but i made that decision because this was truely a awsome place i never felt affraid to be a woman by myself with a 5 year old everyone went out of there way to help me if i ever had a issue with my room they were there with in 15 min. Bee,Tracy and Kim were the best!!!! Im a VERY picky person and expect only the best when im paying!!! I made great friends there both workers and guest that i still speak to till this day.Please listen to me i think i should know this place very well since i stayed for a year the only reason i left is my condo was finally done!!!</p><br>Cheap and Stinky<p>I stayed at this hotel with a couple of friends because of its proximity to the Sam Boyd Stadium. We had general admission tickets for a rock concert, so we felt that this was an ideal place.

The reason why I would not recommend this place is because the beds were rock hard, the kitchen was understocked, and the room we stayed in stunk so bad that I had to go out and buy a big bottle of Frebreeze. I used the whole bottle.

There are other little things like $7 Ethernet cables (no wireless) and bug eaten draperies, but I think I covered the main ones. So if you have no sense of smell, don't drink coffee (no coffee maker in room), and like sleeping on rocks, then this place is for you. I would only visit this place again if I was really desperate and needed to tighten the purse strings. If you are wanting a cheap alternative to staying on the Main Strip, there are plenty other places that would be better than this one. In the future, I will be sure to budget for something nicer.</p><br></body></html>
