<html><head><h3>Siena Suites Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 1</h3></head><body><br>Siena Suites is very good!<p>I stayed in Siena Suites for 9 days in early November, 2015.

The first thing I noticed was that the men working the front desk were very busy and very attentive dealing with multiple patrons. Ezekiel took care of me even though he was multi-tasking with other things. Ezekiel was friendly, professional, quick, explained everything to me and answered all my questions. He is a very hard-working host! :)

Special mention to Ebony as well. She is always helpful, professional, very knowledgeable, proper and reassuring.

The evening Manager also welcomed me into his office one day and we chatted and he was very professional and welcoming.

The rooms I stayed in were very clean and comfortable and well maintained. The grounds were keep clean by many staff and security staff was present and caring. I would recommend this hotel to everyone.
Room Tip: The Wifi is free but not great reception in all rooms. The best Wifi connection is in the lobby.

We had a couple issues with our toilet but every time we had one Jon Jon came right up no problem and was very friendly but overall it was a great place</p><br>Cockroach Taking a Bath<p>We booked this place because it was within walking distance of Thomas Mack Stadium. We should have driven. As soon as we walked in the door it smelled stale. Then we used the toilet and it was running so it wasn't flushing. We called the front desk and they said they would send someone right away to fix it. We left to go have some fun, came back hours later and it still wasn't repaired. In the morning my husband turned on the water in the shower and a cockroach disappeared down the drain or a hole in the wall. We stopped by the office to ask them to fix the toilet again and they said they would send someone in 5 minutes. We left for the football game and came back hours later again and it still was broken. We gave up. The carpets were not clean. If we wanted to go somewhere without a working toilet we could have gone camping and used an outhouse! The front desk said they rent rooms by the day, week, or month. The place looked like it should have been renting by the hour. DON'T STAY THERE!</p><br>Give this place a miss.<p>The staff were very nice but my room was filthy. Bugs running round the floor, broken bed, stank of smoke, cigarette burns, tub didn't drain properly. I'm fine with basic and I wanted an extended stay but this place was so bad I ended up booking another hotel for my last night because I couldn't spend any more time there. After I left all my clothes and luggage still reeked of smoke.</p><br>Nasty<p>My friend chose this place because it had a kitchenette. The pictures show pans etc- not a single dish. There was a dead bird in the pool, it looked like it hadn't been cleaned in weeks. Trash and yuck everywhere. Apparently the website says otherwise The grounds</p><br>Anything you pay is too much!<p>Dirty room, no towels were provided for my room and nobody could bring it to me because it was late. It was cheaper than some motels but it isn't worth it. They gave a room right in front of the avenue which was very noisy. Don't stay there!
Room Tip: Don't go there

The hotel was hear most of our planned adventures, and the view was great.</p><br>Don't stay here!<p>This is an apartment building, not a hotel. They call it an extended stay hotel, but it is an apartment building. The room was poorly furnished and dirty. Check in was fine, but I fear for my safety as we traveled to the room. I worried that our Uhaul truck was going to stolen from the parking lot, didn't get much sleep that night since I was up everytime I heard a noise in the parking lot.
Room Tip: Stay at another hotel!
See more room tips</p><br>Outstanding service, Outstanding Hotel<p>I had heard some good things about this Hotel but didn't know what to expect, I figured it could go either way since everyone has different opinions. Since the location was a little off the beaten path, I had some reservations as to the area. Since moving in, I have found that the area is not bad at all. Unless you live in a gated area in Vegas your always going to have some transient pedestrian traffic, it's just the way it is. Here, I see security roaming around to keep that to a minimum. Other areas of Vegas Security hardly ever shows up even when they are supposed to. Sometimes they run out of towels but within a day I get them usually, this does not bother or surprise me much, afterall I am on a monthly rate and the emphasis is on the daily rate persons, I get it. No pots or pans in the kitchen is NOT a problem, who would want to cook on something someone else has used and not to mention a health hazard, so bring your own or go to the dollar store. There is a dishwasher so you can wash everything before you leave. In my opinion this place is great, not perfect but fully functional and perfect for me.
Room Tip: Top floor is always my preferred place

Room Tip: All the rooms had great A/C. The noise level at the building 9 was quiet.
