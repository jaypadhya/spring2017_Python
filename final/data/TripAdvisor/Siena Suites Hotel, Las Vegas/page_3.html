<html><head><h3>Siena Suites Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 3</h3></head><body><br>Tranquil home away from home<p>Siena Suites is a very comfortable place. It is extended stay and offers large, comfortable, 1 & 2 bedroom apartment like accommodations. Full kitchens, full baths, separate living room. The one bedroom I stayed in had two televisions. Also has drip coffee machine, full fridge, microwave, stove with oven, and free internet. It is fairly no-frill, about 2 1/2 stars would be my guess. But the room was very, very clean, no bugs, really clean and well maintained grounds, lots of free parking, nice pool, workout facilities, pets allowed, professional staff, & laundry facilities. It is ideal for those who are relocating, or in need of temporary extended accommodation. It is on Boulder Highway and Russell Road. Lots of stores, large and small casinos, and restaurants within walking distance or short car drive. Recommend bringing dishes, pots, pans, baking sheet, silverware, and a toaster to complete your stay!
Room Tip: Does have smoking rooms. Ask for a room off the Boulder Highway side for less traffic noise.

It was a welcome change, from the average fly-by-night hotel stay.
I was fortunate to have a veritable small apartment-sized room.
There was a full kitchenette, even.
The A/C units, lights, & bathroom exhaust fans, were all in good working order.
One can completely close the window shades- for privacy.
Maid service was efficient & honest.
The room rates were fair.
On the disappointing side, in-room wifi was unavailable, plus there was spotty internet roaming.
Although the Vegas rat race can be EXTREMELY stressful & ennervating; I was happy to get some tranquil rest time in this particular establishment.
Because many-to-most of the people staying at Siena Suites are long-term guests; they tended to be alot quieter & more considerate neighbors to be around..
The vicinity around the hotel complex is in the process of being revitalized; so don't expect elegant poshness.
For me, it was nice to take a break from the Strip's noisy & pretentious establishments.
There are alot of people struggling to get by in this part of Las Vegas; which is a slightly unsettling eye-opener.
Both the expansive low-rise hotel complex, & its surrounding area, are a refreshingly far cry from the stiltified monocultural uniformity of Henderson/ Boulder City, & the Ã¼ber-chic trendiness of the Strip {central LV Blvd.}.
A good, solid place to stay.</p><br>Rafael S<p>needed a place to stay for a week , I was very reluctant to stay because of some of the reviews . I booked online . Showed up 30 minutes later and ebony greeted me with a smile and was very kind and helpful , she made me and my family feel welcomed . The room was nice and clean , the ac was nice and cold , the maid service was fantastic . the laundry facility was clean and all the machines were operational . Every employee that I came in contact with provided excellent service . I must say I will definitely return when needed . and I will recommend the sienna suites to friends and family . I want to thank everyone especially Ebony !!!!!!!!</p><br>Poor service<p>This place serves as both a hotel and long-term housing. As a hotel it fails to deliver. They provide a kitchen, microwave, fridge, stove, and dishwasher but not a single pot, pan, dish, cup, or utensil. If you want fresh towels, toilet paper, etc. be prepared to raid the cart - we never saw a housekeeper in the three days we were here. We won't be returning.</p><br>Great Value an Friendly Staff<p>I'm in the process of relocating to Vegas and needed to find an extended stay hotel. I've been checking in and out of Siena Suites for going on seven months. It's in a great location away from all the congestion of the Strip. The rooms are clean, there is plenty of parking and it's a good value for the money. The staff is friendly and courteous especially Liz who works in the evenings. On one of my visits I needed a room on the first floor for my wife who was visiting. Liz went above and beyond to find me a room that would work for us. It was the kind of service you'd expect from a much higher priced hotel. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who is visiting Vegas.</p><br>What is going on there<p>we had stayed at this hotel previously. The last stay we left early and were told we would be able to use the two nights at a later date. When I called the clerk said she would call me back in 30 minutes. That call never came. I then went and booked the room on orbitz,so we would have a room and would ask about those days when we arrived. Upon our arrival to check therewas a young man who appeared to be very overwhelmed , by the phone constantly ringing and several other customers were waiting to checkin, or had other issues. He finally did check us in ,but claimed he did not see any notation regarding those two days . I asked for a manager but was told she was at lunch, and should return with the hour. We then went to the room. Upon opening the door I noticed all the burn marks in the carpet, and saw a huge cockroach in the bathroom. There was also a large area in the carpet that had a really poor job of a patch,a large burn hole in the couch cushion, that had been flipped over to conseal it . The kitchen floor looked like there had been a fire and it was stained with black . There was a sticky material on the door above knob,and the door did not close well , you could see outside . The person above us was constantly stomping and making very disturbing noise, and had his music up so loud you could feel the vibration in the wall. There were also many scary looking people just lurking around on the stairs. I spoke with a person who identified herself as Liz , who only gave us one night. I did not debate, but chose at that time , that we would not stay there again due to all of the room issues. It appears that management needs to inform their staff of procedural protocols , so they are not misleading customers. It appears that there has been a change for the worst at Siena Suites. We would rather stay where we know that it is clean and safe, and where customer satisfaction is a priority</p><br>Spring Break 2015<p>After reading some of the reviews, I have to say I had reservations about choosing this hotel. My children and I stayed in the 2 bedroom suite. The rooms were clean the staff pleasant and helpful. I felt completely safe being there. The other tenants were friendly, quiet and respectful. I did laundry at 2:00 am in their locked facility without feeling fearful of being there alone at that time. No, there wasn't any utensils there, but they could be attained at the office. I did not see any drug dealers there nor was I approached by anyone, at any time, for any reason. I saw no roaches all appliances were clean and in working order. I would definitely stay there again!</p><br>my vegas vacation<p>My kids and I went to Las Vegas for the Rugby 7's. Feb 12- 16th. We go to vegas at least once per year and we always stay at Siena Suites. We really enjoyed this last visit. I booked my rooms back in November 2014 knowing it would get full fast. I called and spoke to Nicole about my rate and she was so nice and helpful and was able to get me a better rate. I then called again and she was out on maternity leave and I had the pleasure of dealing with Keisha. She was so friendly and her customer service was awesome. Because of these two individuals I will continue to stay at Siena Suites when I go to Las Vegas. Thanks for an awesome Experience.</p><br>Great Hotel With Great Rate to match<p>I stayed here a week and loved it service was great rooms really clean i felt like i was at home. from the time i checked in to the time i checked out front desk and housekeeping and management was awesome. They have a business center that is open 24hrs that u can print and do whatever u need to as well as wifi. I WILL BE BACK..</p><br>You have been warned!!!<p>I recommend YOU DO NOT STAY HERE! If you have ANY class or integrity about you. If you don't? Well this place is just right for you!

I wish I could give this disgusting smoke smelling hell hole a negative review!

First of all, I was trying to check in early. Check-in is at 3pm. I showed up at 11. If they said it was way too early to check-in, no big deal, I would have left and come back. HOWEVER they said they could allow me to check-in early for an extra fee of $28.00, which is a cleaning fee. A cleaning fee? They wanted me to pay extra for a job that the maid gets paid to do already?! I asked to speak with a manager and she said to just give them a room. So my question is, where, or rather who's pockets, was this extra $28 going? Really? When they already had a room ready to go!!


Secondly, If you are a non smoker, like I am, you can smell the repulsive putrid smell that tobacco can leave lingering behind, anywhere, ESP in room 8115! Upon walking into the room the smell hits you like a ton of bricks. I have curly hair and any of my curly haired sisters would know, our hair likes to trap smells of ANY kind, good or bad. I was in the room for 20 mins as I changed clothes and then shortly after left to go about my day. I could smell smoke for hours, just as if I had spent time in one of the casinos for a while...

I came back around 345pm and honestly was so upset the room still smelled the same as I left it, I asked if I could cancel. The thought of inhaling the terrible aroma of tobacco all night was unbearable. The lady at the front desk said since I used a third party to book, I would have to go thru the ties party to cancel. Okay ... So I called them, they put me on hold, called Siena Suites and was told by the lady at the front desk they will not refund the money.

So I asked the front lady, why not just tell me that in the first place? She had no response. I asked to speak with the manager. Over the phone, Bill Deyo- the Director of Operations, told the front desk lady that I could check-out but he will not refund the $140.00 I spent on the room, FOR ONE NIGHT. Unacceptable. So she offered me another room, room 13302. Told me to check it out and if it's okay, just transfer my belongings there. I was not pleased, but took the key and checked it out... Low and behold, that same sickening smell creeped up my nostrils.

I went back to the front desk, told them it was the same, and asked to speak with the manager. They took me to Bill Deyo's office, and he said he went to my room, room 8115, and it smelled like perfume. CLEARLY THIS MAN IS A SMOKER, bc no perfume can cover the smell of tobacco no where, no how. He said that bc it is NYE and bc the room doesn't smell like smoke, he will not refund my money.

I have never had such poor service in my life!! I will never stay here again. If your customer is telling you OVeR and OVER again that it smells like smoke, why not accommodate them?? Rather than have an angry, disgruntled customer that will tell everyone and anyone NOT to ever stay here. This place is a joke! Has sheets from the 80's, old carpet, OLD furniture... The list goes on. I could look past it if the smell wasn't so bad... But clearly Siena Suites Hotel and Bill Deyo could care less how their customers feel.

My honest opinion, even if you see a cheap price when you see this place online.. Keep scrolling. Don't be trapped or stuck or out money, bc you don't want to stay here. As if I have $140 to just throw away ... Just disgusted with this place-- DO NOT STAY HERE! Trust me, you will thank me later! Or if you do stay here, you'll here me saying I told you so, in the back of your mind within minutes of checking-in and opening the room to your door ...</p><br></body></html>
