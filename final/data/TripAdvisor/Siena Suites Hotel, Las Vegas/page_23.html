<html><head><h3>Siena Suites Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 23</h3></head><body><br>Very pleasant surprise on the high quality of the place<p>We had tickets to see U2 in town. I did not ask for it, but they placed us in the farthest building which was the closest to the stadium. (Although I did mention I was going to the concert when I called few days earlier to check on my reservation.) The stadium is a five minute walk from the hotel. The hotel has plenty of parking near the rooms.

The room was huge and clean with two TVs. The bed was firm and comfy. If you stay here make sure to bring food and stuff because the kitchen is great for preparing your own meals; fridge, micro and dishwasher, even pots and pans are all there. Do bring some dish liquid and dish cloths though if you intend to use them.

If you don’t mind the stairs, ask to be placed on the top third floor so you won’t hear guest above you. We didn’t have any next door neighbors so it was pretty quiet.

Check out time was noon so we had plenty of time to sleep in after the late night show and the room stayed dark thanks to the thick curtains. We would definitely stay here in the future if going to the stadium.</p><br>Inexpensive, but nothing speical<p>My two young sons and my wife and I stayed here during beautiful fall weather (80s and sunny each day) and went to a football game at Sam Boyd Stadium (which was walking distance from the room).

This place looks like a huge apartment complex with 14 three-floor buildings. The landscaping is pleasant and the structures are all stucco. Many of the guests are actually long-term residents and several have pets in their rooms and keep piles of stuff at their doors. Two little dog poop bags were by the stairs we climbed all three days we were there.

Our room was large and the tiled areas and surfaces were clean but the carpet was quite stained. We had a two-bedroom on the top floor so we couldn't hear any noise above us but we could hear everything our next door neighbors had to say. The center room was a kitchen area with a small couch (not a sofa bed). Inexplicably, only three chairs were at the small table (and no chairs in the rooms) so all four us could never sit and eat all together. Near the table is an ethernet plug, where you plug your computer to get the Internet (make sure you bring your won ethernet cable). There is no wireless service. Occasionally, I had to quit my browser and email when the service went out but it was reasonably reliable.

There were a few utensils and the very cheapest plastic plates and bowls (four of each). The unit also featured a dishwasher but no dishwashing soap, dish cloths or automatic detergent. So we just used hot water and hoped for the best. There was plenty of cabinet space but no toaster or any other small appliances like a blender.

The beds were firm but also kind of noisy. The pillows were also lumpy. The sheets had a prominent bleach smell, which was oddly comforting. The towels were thin and rough. The air conditioning worked well. We never had the attendants clean the room while we there to save resources.

The kids and I swam in the pool and used the hot tub, which also were strongly chlorinated. Pool is only four feet deep.

Check-in was slow as the three attendants were all trying to solve a computer problem and hardly noticed me waiting. Check-out service at the front desk was also slow and they couldn't print my receipt. I sense they are not highly trained or paid.

All that said, it was a decent deal at less than $60 a night though they added $2 a day for long distance though we never picked up a phone.</p><br>Better than I expected!<p>After spending many hours trying to figure out where I was going to stay on my trip to Las Vegas I decided to Stay at Siena Suites. After driving for 24 hr and following the map I printed off of google maps I rolled into Siena Suites with no problems at all. The hotel is located right on Boulder HWY with a huge well lit sign which makes it almost impossible to miss even for a tired blurred vision traveler like myself.

It took about 10 minutes to check in and the lady at the counter was very knowledgeable, so check in was a breeze. I then lugged my bags up the steps to my 2 bedroom suite. I can honestly say the suite I stayed in was as good or better than the pictures I viewed on the internet before I booked my stay. The buildings were well maintained and the grounds were clean. The swimming pool and hot tub were both clean and pretty nice in my opinion!

My over all opinion of this hotel is pretty good and I would definitely stay here again, but I don't think Siena Suites is for everybody and I will tell you why.

1. The walls are paper thin! I tried getting a suite on the 3rd floor so I wouldn't hear people walking above me, but I ended up having to settle for a 2nd floor suite. The people above me were not very loud but I could still hear them walking. I could also hear when people were running water and walking by the suite I was in. The noise didn't both me a whole lot because I knew the walls were thin, but if your a light sleeper this could make for an uncomfortable stay. My advice would be to get a 3rd level suite if at all possible so you don't hear people walking above you. If you can't get a 3rd level suite I would suggest asking at the front desk to be put in a suite they feel will be quiet, because this place has the potential to be very loud if there are families with children or young people who tend to stay up late and make noise.

2. I'm pretty tolerant and understand things happen, but thought I would add this also, because it was part of my experience at Siena Suites. Maintenance in my opinion is a little bit slow, but they did get the job done! When I got to my room the remote for the tv didn't work. Not a big deal, but it took about 16 hrs before maintenance came to reprogram the remote. Then I had toilet problems, but lucky for us we had a two bedroom suite so we did have one working toilet. The issue with the toilet was the float was sticking and the tank would over flow. This could happen to any toilet and I don't hold it against Siena Suites, but once again it took 16 hours to get maintenance to come fix it. From what I was told they don't have 24 hr maintenance. Maintenance shows up about 8:00 am. They came to fix the toilet late in the afternoon. It's pretty laid back around Siena Suites so if you want things done right now, you might get irritated with how long it takes for maintenance to show up.

3. The internet. I was rather impressed with the speed of the internet. I was able to watch videos on my computer and check email just as I would at home, but the internet was down for at least 12 hours while I was there, but it did get fixed and everything was fine.

4. Laundry is not coin operated. You have to buy a card and you can only purchase in $5 or larger amounts, but laundry is about $3.00 a load to wash and dry, so that isn't to bad!!!

5. No elevators and outdoor entrances to all rooms pretty much like a Motel, so if you don't like or can't do steps this could be an issue for you.

6. If you plan to walk to the casino's don't even think about it!!! I think the closest casino I could find would be the Cannery on Boulder Hwy and that has to be about 3 miles away. If you have a car this is a great place to stay, but if you have to take taxi's it could get pretty expensive. I had a car and i like to drive, so it worked out just fine for me.

Like I said, overall I was pretty impressed. My room was very clean. It had pots, pans, silver wear and cups. The bed was not top of the line, but I thought it was plenty comfortable. I spent $47 a night for 7 night in a 2 bedroom suite that was comfortable overlooking the pool. If you are tolerant of noise like I am this is a very good deal and I would recommend it to anybody!!!</p><br>A Great Place To Stay<p>This is the best value for money extended stay hotel in Vegas.
The rooms are very clean, the majority of staff are friendly & very helpful.
The pools & hot tubs are clean but could do with some new pool side furniture!
I have lived here for nearly 3 years on & off and I find it secure & comfortable.

If you are intending to stay for 1 week or more before October 23rd 2009 please contact me at moreforless1@gmail.com</p><br>Inexpensive Extended Stay with Issues<p>The Sienna Suites look great from a distance but under the microscope, it's not so pretty. At $45 per night for a 2 bedroom with 2 bath, it's a bargain. But beware the $2 per night "mandatory" fee added for long distance phone service, whether you use that service or not. It is not negotiable. But hey, the Orleans in Vegas adds a similar "surcharge" only they call it a $5 per room, per day resort fee.

We stayed at the Sienna Suites for the last 2 weeks of May and here's a further breakdown of our experience:

1) Cleaniness: other reviewers praise the cleaniness of this place and I will say the grounds are well kept, if you can overlook the cigarette butts that contaminate the red gravel landscaping. We were on the second floor of building 1 and there was a small pile of trash at the top of the stairs outside our room that was not picked up for 6 days. Maids and service people constantly walked by that pile and did nothing about it. It was only removed when some of it fell to the first floor.

2) Weekly maid service: inconsistent. The maid assigned to clean our room the first week brought in towels, did not remove the dirty ones, did not sweep or vacuum and did not even want to re-make the beds with new sheets. She feigned lack of understanding English. The maid who cleaned our room in week two did a decent job.

3) Trash: I could find no place to empty our trash containers inbetween weekly maid service. The Sienna Suites consists of 14 buildings and yet the map of the complex did not indicate where to take your trash.

4) Cooking: there was a full size stove in our unit but no pots or pans to cook with. Fortunately we had our car camping kit with us but how lame is that. There were 3 TV's in our unit, one per room, but no pots or utensils. THIS IS WHY YOU STAY AT A PLACE LIKE THIS...TO OCCASSIONALLY COOK A MEAL.

5) The internet: the good -- it's not Wifi but wired. You plug into the wall and that guarantees or should guarantee more consistent performance. And for the first 6 days, it was decent enough for most surfing and email. You cannot watch movies on hulu and youtube videos buffer constantly. There is one T1 line (1.5 MB, the speed of a DSL line) coming into the hotel that everyone shares so you do the math.

Here's the bad about the internet: the friday evening before memorial day, when the place is packed, the internet goes down. And it's still down saturday morning. Then, on the following Wednesday morning, it's down again, sporadically all day. Even when it's up, I can receive email but I cannot send it. Yes, internet is more complicated than your landline phone service but give me a break, it's been around since the late '90s now and if you're going to shout free internet on your blinking billboard out front, then you better well have a reliable system. If you need to depend on your email working for business, DO NOT STAY HERE.

6) Location: a 15 min or so drive to Hoover Dam, which is an amazing place.

7) Overall room noise: We were on the second floor and although it appeared there was a flight path to the airport above the Suites, we never heard anything. And until a family occupied the unit above us, we never heard any outside noise. However, like most inexpensive hotels, the Sienna Suites were constructed poorly and the family above sounded like a herd of elephants on the warpath.

8) Amenities: there are 2 pools and plenty of parking. However, there are no luggage carts. Ok, there are no elevators in any of the buildings but the walk from your parked car to your room can be a long one and a cart holding your luggage would at least help get you to the stairs.

9) Laundry: Guess what, there's another "surcharge" for laundry... you have to load money onto a card and there's a one time set up fee for the card. In addition, you can only load $5 or $10 onto the card...no multiples of $1. So one load of laundry ends up costing you $5.</p><br>Not too bad<p>The hotel property is maintained quite well, and the service from Tracy or Marcos in the office is excellent. (Hope you deal with them- they are great)
I'm not sure why the hot tub often looks so dirty much of the time. I was told that the pool and hot tub are serviced 3 times a week, but that can't be true. Just look at the pics, it is filthy. There is no reason why it needs to look that bad. This hot tub gets a tremendous amount of use and should be maintained better. I've never stayed at a hotel where the hot tub looked so filthy. Yuck! (Believe me, it has looked worse than what even these pics show)</p><br>Great value, location, and quiet<p>I stayed at the Siena Suites Hotel for one week and found it to be a good value at the price I paid which was just a little over $300 for 7 nights compaired to staying at most of the high price casinos. The hotel is in a good location and just minutes from the strip.

The suite consisted of two rooms with a door between the bedroom and living room area. The bedroom, large enough for a king-sized bed, two bedside tables, and table lamps. The bathroom was a bit small & the toilet and bath area has it's own door, but very well maintained. Cleaning service does not come by everyday, but if you are needing extra towels or toilet paper, they are around cleaning other rooms or you can go to the office to get more.

Both the livingroom and bedroom has a TV each and hook up to cable. Has all the local stations plus a few sports channels, HBO, kids channels, Spanish and a few other channels. There is a separate, independently controllable a/c & heater unit for each of the main rooms.

The Kitchen area has a full size fridge, stove, microwave, and dishwasher. There are only enough plates and glasses for two people, so if more are staying in the room you may want to pick up some paper plates and plastic ware.</p><br>Reasonable rates<p>My husband and I stayed at the Siena Suites on more that one occassion and I have never experienced any problems. The rooms are always clean and they are roomy. We happened to have enjoyed our stay and we recommended this hotel to our family and friends. The prices are great for what you are getting and it is very convenient to all the food locations an close to the strip. This is just like a home away from home.</p><br>Good Value<p>I stayed at the Siena Suites Hotel for one night during the weekend of February 14-15 and found it to be a good value at the price I paid, in my opinion. The hotel is a newer property, and it shows. Much thought appears to have gone into its design, layout, and landscaping.

The suite consisted of two rooms -- three, including the bathroom -- separated by a lockable door. There is a full kitchen with stove, oven, microwave, full refrigerator with freezer, and a dishwasher. The appliances appeared immaculate. Dishes and coffee cups are supplied, as well as ample cookware. A coffee-maker is also supplied.

The bedroom, large enough for a king-sized bed, two bedside tables, and table lamps, was clean and well-appointed. A mirror and two lighting sconces faced the bed. The bathroom was a bit small, but very well maintained and came with a hair dryer as well as the standard towels, soap, and shampoo. The bathroom is within the bedroom and the toilet and bath area has its own door.

There were two large color televisions with cable, one for each of the main rooms. Each room also had a modern hotel-style telephone.

The living area consisted of an entertainment center, coffee table, and small sofa. The dining area next to the kitchen included a sturdy dining table which may easily be used as a work desk. Two chairs complete the dining suite.

Lighting throughout was ample. There is a separate, independently controllable HVAC unit for each of the main rooms.

Parking was good and noise was reasonable, given that there are two windows and the suite opened to an exterior hallway facing the parking lot. It is my observation that all units seem to open to an unenclosed hallway or directly to the outside, motel-style. My unit was on the third floor.

I hope that this hotel maintains its present level of service and value. I hope, as well, that this hotel expands beyond the Las Vegas area, as it is superior to many other hotels of this type I can think of.</p><br>Bed Bugs Bite!<p>The Siena Suites was listed on the Obama website and offered a discount to anyone coming to Nevada for the Drive for Change. I thought that was fantastic and booked my two-night stay. What I didn't bargain for was waking the first morning to bed bugs swarming the bed. I had been a meal for several hours. I immediately called the front desk and they said they would move me to another room. Later when I spoke to another desk clerk, she said I should speak with the manager and he would most likely give me a refund. I spoke with the manager on duty and he did not give me a refund. About an hour after I returned to my room, I did receive a coupon for a complementary night stay. As if I would go back. I sent a letter to the supervising manager, and an email follow up demanding a refund, (bed bug bites do not show up for 9 - 14 days AFTER you see them crawling on you), and not only have not heard back - it's been three weeks - I have not even gotten an acknowledgment that they received my letters. I highly recommend you don't stay here.</p><br></body></html>
