<html><head><h3>Siena Suites Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 16</h3></head><body><br>Value For Money Stay In Las Vegas<p>We stayed there during August 2011 & we found that the hotel was very nicely maintained from inside out. The hotel is spread across a big area consisting of 12 buildings. Depending on which building you get a room, you may find that the hotel reception is too far. The only downside I found is the room service, as after 5 PM if you need anything (bedsheets, towel etc.) you'll have to walk down to the reception yourself to get it as the receptionist will simply refuse to deliver anything to your room saying room service guys has left for the day. This hotel does not have any casino & this hotel is located on Boulder Highway 10 miles away from Vegas Strip; so if you've visiting Las Vegas just for gambling then this hotel may not be a right place for you to stay as you'll prefer to stay close to the Strip; however this will be a good choice considering value for money proposition.</p><br>Looks better on photographs as it is in reality<p>This hotel and extended stay suites is a very big complex of numerous buildings, 3 floors high. It is located right on Boulder Highway, a restaurant is right beside (Irish/ Pub).
A casino is not far. The pool area in between some of the buildings looks really pretty and spacious. It just was too cold to use in November.

I do agree with former reviews.

I got a room in house 11, 3rd floor. No elevators, steep stairs and outdoor corridors. The building is located in the back of the facility. It did face a sports field, but it was quiet as there was no big street there, and Boulder highway is far enough on the other side of the hotel. Stairs did not look so very well maintained.

Check-in was quick, it's a tiny lobby, not at all inviting. As I got an affordable rate for a friday night, which is usually expensive in Las Vegas and area, I had not expected much. Staff was not too friendly, but ok for me.

The room was a 1 bedroom suite, with separate kitchen/living room. The furniture is old and cheap and the plastic is peeling off on some parts of the furniture. The kitchen though is huge, with big fridge and freezer, oven, dining table and chairs. No dishes at all and only 1 package of coffee as others already said.There is a sofa and old TV in there. Small choice of TV channels. And TV handsets was missing.

The bedroom had 2 queen beds with spring matrasses, and they were good. As were the pillows. Blankets were cheap motel style woolen ones. TV in the bedroom is no flat TV as well.

Both rooms had various lamps. Tough the lights were not really very bright at all.

Internet is free with a cable which you get at check-in (if you ask). Internet quality was very good.

The bathroom was the tiniest one I have ever seen. You should not think of closing the door while sitting on the toilet. A sink with small counter is outside the bathroom in the bedroom. The tub was ok, cheap showerhead, not perfectly clean. You get a small shampoo and soap. Not too many towels, but they were ok. You will hear water and ventilation from around, the walls are thin.

This place is not new though probably newly painted. The carpet looks worn and it was not vacuumed very well.

What made me feel a bit unsafe was, that on the door 2 rooms further a broken police seal was still put on. Management should have removed it, it really looked like the place is not safe at all. There was ongoing renovation in that room that had been sealed by the police... well...who knows...
A resident told me that recently the SWAT team had been there... Must have been at that room...

I cannot really recommend this place. The rooms and furniture are not modern in any way and look worn. If they'd renovate it and put new modern stuff into the rooms, I would say go there. At the moment it's less than an average motel.

I missed information material about the hotel, Henderson or Las Vegas. There was a menu to order some food in the room, that's all.

This hotel is in Henderson at it takes half an hour to drive to the Strip.
Room Tip: ask for a room facing the pool.

First of all it's quite far from the strip, if you are going to enjoy the Casinos and the night life you'll don't want to have 15 miles to drive on your way back at 2 o'clock in the morning.
Second of all, you'll find the apartments very plainly furnished with no personality and last but not least there is no kitchen equipment whatsoever, not even a glass or a fork. Hotel policy so they say.
So those apartments are mostly occupied by long time customers.</p><br>Good news-Bad news<p>My husband, a cousin and I were in town to visit a terminally ill aunt. On line, this place looked like what we needed: a two bedroom suite, with a common area/kitchenette. On arrival, the facility looked well maintained, but the inside was pretty shabby. There was a coffee pot provided, with one packet of coffee....but no cups or coffee set ups. No glasses/cups (paper, styrofoam or otherwise) in the bathroom either. Carpet was dingy an stained, and lighting was very poor. All ice machines were empty. On complaining to the desk clerk (who was polite and friendly enough) we were told they did not provide cups, but we could come to the lobby for coffee, and there was a gas station on the corner where we could buy ice. No apologies.
The good news is that the suite was clean, and the beds (both king sized) were comfortable. The rooms were also spacious, and the kitchenette area was large (though there are not any kind of supplies there.) The rates are very low (which should be a clue to the quality.) The pool area is nice and seems well maintained.
This is an extended stay facility and there are families who appear to be living in some of the areas.
I would not stay here again.</p><br>Cheap<p>The good news is that its in a good location to go get food. There are a lot of people that live there. It is very cheap. You might feel a little grungy staying there. We had three rooms rented out and one of them found a dirty sock in their bed the first night. I suggest if you want to take the bus to Fremont or the strip you be very careful. It gets a little rough in the late night. Basically I would just stay on the strip.</p><br>Aussie traveller<p>The Siena Suites offers good, clean suites at a reasonable price.When you check their website, you will see a well equiped suite with a kitchen. Here is the catch to be VERY aware of. There is a coffee machine with 1 sachet but NO CUPS TO DRINK IT FROM. There is a microwave, oven and stove top all in good order but NO CUTLERY OR CROCKERY OR COOKING UTENSILS to prepare a meal and eat it with. Hello!!!! This is crazy. Management decided to remove these items. Save yourself the trouble, go elsewhere. Las Vegas has many good hotels offering better value andf a lot more common sense. "Goodbeard" was here before they removed all of the eating, drinking and cooking items. Tell me which traveller would bring their cutlery with them? We wouldn't have checked in if there was a kitchen and no other faciities</p><br>Bad customer service<p>Lady at front desk(check in) was very rude and not polite at all, then only 2 bath towels.
in the morning on our first day we ask the service ladies to provide us with more towels and on our checking out day, still not towels at all. When we ask again for towels the emloyee(male) brough them with very bad attitide.
The room is ok and comfotable.</p><br>Quiet and good value for money<p>A quiet area where we could rest up after busy days around Vegas. Only issue was not having wireless internet with only cable services available, not much good for the ipad. Good to have cooking facilities and fridge so we stocked up on food and drinks for once.</p><br>We're having second thoughts<p>This is our 3rd time staying here. I really like the fact that the room is set up like a one bedroom apartment. I have a small child so I was able to make bottles or meals for him rather than having to go out all the time to get what I needed.
We didn't really need much help from the house keeping but when we did they were very nice and helpful, however the front desk clerk was not very courteous and could use some improvement on her people skills.
I like that it is pet friendly and that their is a park nearby. I like that there is 2 pools rather than 1 so its not always crowded.</p><br>Good value with some problems.<p>I was here from 8/17 to 8/22, for a business trip.

For a true suite, this was a good value.

The bathroom area was poorly designed, in that the bathroom door blocked the sink area when it was open. A pocket door design would have been wiser.

There was a strong smell like a used cat litter box in the vicinity of my bathroom sink, the whole 5 days I was there,

On Friday, I had a "do not disturb" sign on my door until noon, because I work 3rd shift, and then called the front desk at noon, to ask for them to send housekeeping over. They said they would do that. When I returned to the room at 5 PM, housekeeping never visited. I called the front desk, they said that housekeeping was gone for the day, and they would get it Saturday.

Saturday, I went hiking, and a considerable amount of sand fell out of my shoes onto the carpet, when I got back. they failed to vacuum it up on Sunday's housekeeping visit.

On Thursday morning, I used one of the plates, and left it in the sink. The front desk said that housekeeping would take care of dishes. It was still there when I checked out on Monday.

I hear some suites had dishwashers, mine did not. There was no dishwashing soap available, or scrubbies for cleaning used dishes.

Something was wrong with the bed. If you sat at the end, so to put your shoes on, the bed would begin to teeter-totter.

Internet was available in the room, for free, but it was wired only, and you had to provide your own cable from your laptop to the connector in the wall.</p><br></body></html>
