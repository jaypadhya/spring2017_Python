<html><head><h3>Fairfield Inn Las Vegas Airport Hotel Reviews Page 1</h3></head><body><br>Loved it !<p>The hotel is clean, well appointed . Our room was clean and comfortable . The A/C was very noisy , so I mentioned it in the morning when we went for our free breakfast . When we got back to our room after eating, there was a knock on the door . A very nice young man came to check the A/C . Of course, the thing was well behaved while he was listening for it to act up . He checked it out and said it was the oldest he had seen at this site , and assured us he would swap it out for a newer, quiet one . We went on with our day and when we returned , our room was nicely cooled for us and the A/C was in whisper mode . Hooray ! The breakfast is a very nice bonus , good selection of hot and cold foods . For me, the sugar free syrup was a plus, it meant I got to enjoy a waffle . The hot cocoa being available to make in the room was very nice, as was the coffee and tea that is always in the lobby . There is a small shop by the desk to purchase snacks, beverages , foods you can microwave in your room and even sundries . The outdoor pool is small, but I was the only one who used it in the 5 days we were there . At least we saw no one else use it , and we could see it from our room . There is plenty of parking , and restaurants nearby . If you are up for a walk, the Wynn is a mile away , but the shuttle driver is very kind about dropping people off there if he is doing an airport run . The staff was very polite, friendly and professional . We enjoyed being away from the Strip for the peace and quiet , yet able to go there easily if we chose to do that .</p><br>won't come again<p>They are not very responsible for the work. we check with phone about early check-in time, but when we arrive they can not give us early check-in. So, we need to stay out of the hotel for one night. Tomorrow, we require to fix the tub bath when we go out. However, when we go back they didn't clean the room and not fix the tub bath.
Room Tip: shuttle bus

This is an updated Fairfield so the lobby and room are more modern. The toilet was running in my room but I was only there for 1 night, and was out of the room almost the entire time. So not a very big deal. I have had less than stellar experiences at other Fairfields - but this one was absolutely the best out of all of them so far for me.

Front desk agents were nice and welcoming, in person and over the phone. Which I had remembered some names!

Recommend this hotel for a short top over or even a few days - free breakfast is always great!</p><br>Fabulous location<p>This hotel has the most incredible location. It is right next door to numerous fabulous restaurants. It is also a fabulous find because it has a shuttle to the airport and to the Wynn. The staff is super friendly and extremely efficient. The breakfast is fresh and tasty. I have stayed here at least 8 times in the last year and will continue to stay here again in the future.</p><br>One night stay<p>This hotel is very close to the airport and the strip. We only stayed here one night to catch our flights the next day. Rooms are clean and breakfast included. The only bad thing is that the airplanes fly over every 10 minutes or so and you can here them. But it won't keep you up at night.</p><br>Fairfield Inn stay in Vegas<p>When we arrived, room was not one I reserved but the Manager helped us the next day into the right room. She was one of the most helpful people I have encountered during my stay at any hotel. I would definitely stay there again.</p><br>aging, but OK<p>Spent one night here after arriving on a late flight.

Shuttle was very convenient, driver was great.

The property itself is OK but is showing signs of age. Could have been bad timing, but there was no hot water when I showered. Breakfast was very mediocre. Most Fairfield Inns have stepped up their breakfasts, but not here.

Also, violated my #1 checkout rule by not asking if I had a nice stay.

I'm pretty loyal to Marriott, so I might be back if I'm in the area, or I might look for something a little more up-to-date.</p><br>NACS Conference<p>Hotel was clean and accommodating. Staff was great and friendly. The gym onsite needed some machines repaired but was viable. Pool was open and being used. The shuttle service was available but was very busy due to conference and airport needs.</p><br>Excellent staff<p>Great locations with lots of food options. They have hotel shuttle service. All the staff members really take care of you. Always made me feel welcomed. Wi fi works great and there's a nice breakfast in the morning.</p><br>Great staff<p>The staff was great. They are remodeling. We stayed on the second floor and didn't hear it. The room smelled a little like a smoker had stayed in it, but it was very clean. Every request, the staff jumped on with a smile. Shuttle service to strip was nice. We would stay again.</p><br></body></html>
