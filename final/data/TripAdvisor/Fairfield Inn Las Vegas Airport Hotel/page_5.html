We find the hotels good, service good and locations to where were going excellent. Clean rooms, good breakfast, fast check in and outs. We recommend the hotels to anyone.
Room Tip: We find that all are good.

Due to traveling with children and bad allergies to cigarette smoke we decided to stay off the strip and not in a casino. The Fairfield was an excellent choice. The smoke-free environment was welcomed and the location is close enough to the strip so when we ventured out to do something fun and get dinner it was easy access. There was a shuttle that dropped us off at the Wynn and that was convenient. We took a cab back from Ceasars for only $10. The room was comfortable and clean and was up to par with the typical Fairfield standards. The only downside was that the pool was closed and a swim may have been nice. I would go back for sure depending on my reason for visiting Las Vegas.</p><br>Apart from the "madding crowd"<p>Depending on your reasons for visiting Vegas, this might be an ideal place for you. A shuttle service is available to and from the airport (10 minute ride, but from the airport you might have to wait for pick-up). This is a relatively quiet hotel away from the strip/downtown. A shuttle is also available to take you to and from the strip (one drop-off and pick-up location). I used Marriott points for my stay. The accommodations for my sister and myself were two queen beds. The closet area was very small. The room included microwave, small refrigerator, coffee maker and of course, TV. Internet connection was free and generally reliable. The room was clean; beds were comfortable, but a little soft for me. The pool was closed for resurfacing for my stay, but had I really wanted to use a pool, a sister property was available. My chief complaint was unreliable hot water. It might not have been an issue for people who showered later in the morning but for the early risers (or perhaps the 4th floor residents) the water pressure and amount of hot water varied. This seemed to be a place that flight crews used, so perhaps most people were taking early morning showers! the complimentary breakfast was good and plentiful, from making your own waffles to scrambled eggs or cold cereal and etc. I found the staff to be helpful and accommodating.</p><br>Exceptionally friendly staff and clean rooms<p>When I arrived at the airport I called for the shuttle and to the minute that driver was there. The check-in agent was very nice, speedy and had me checked in within minutes. She explained that the weekend breakfast started at 7am and on weekdays at 630--very helpful.

The next morning, the next front desk agent ensured that my two day room stay would go without interruption: when booking two separate days through a third party site, often one has to check out and check back in again. She took care of this so my stay would be seamless.

My room though clean, with two Queen beds did feel a little cramped. I was on floor three and it took the shower about 2-5 minutes to reach hot so I could shower, but as I was in no rush, this was not an issue.

I enjoyed the breakfast choices which for me was fruit and yogurt. Coffee was available all day long. On my first morning, still being on Eastern time I was awake hours before breakfast was to be served and the kind bus driver hunted me down a banana. They were so nice.

The area is fine if one stays on Paradise Road. Just a few minutes North is a 7-11 which is very accessible and a great place to get a few extra snacks. I would advise not going East from there on Sands. Like any city, there are areas that safety could be a concern and walking East on Sands was one of those. I found a wine store on an internet map search and decided to walk over. In the daytime, suddenly I found myself with about four police cars around me--not for me but for a local person who was involved in something illegal obviously.

Paradise Road South and of course going West will take anyone to the Strip so that was fine.

This hotel too had a strict non-smoking policy which was wonderful! If the pool was not under construction, I probably would have stayed the entire week. They did offer up a shuttle service to their sister property but for tanning, I prefer just to be able to have it on-site. This hotel would be great for those who want to leave the madness of the Strip behind but still access it with a short 15-20 min walk!
Room Tip: A small hotel so any room would be fine
See more room tips</p><br>Nice Contemporary Hotel<p>Very nice hotel with contemporary decor. The rooms had a really cool pull out table under the desk and there were ample plugs for phones and ipads on both night stands. It was in a good location, not far from the airport, a short distance from the strip, and next to a strip mall and numerous small eateries. Good full breakfast with sausage, eggs (boiled and scrambled), fruit, make your own waffles, oatmeal and muffins.</p><br>CLEAN!!<p>We stayed 2 nights and it is a very clean hotel. I was very impressed. The breakfast selection in the mornings isn't to shabby either. The staff was helpful the second night but the first night she couldn't be bothered. Our TV didn't work (yes, I checked to see if it was plugged in). Now, I know we were in Vegas and there shouldn't be time for TV anyway but while I was ironing I would've liked some background noise or something. This hotel's location is decent. It is off the strip but if you're willing to walk a few blocks you'll be right on the strip. Or, obviously there is free self-park to at almost all of the casinos and buildings.

The beds were comfortable and the rooms were clean and big. The bathrooms were also a decent size and also very clean.</p><br>Great stay at this hotel<p>We had a great time at this hotel. The staff were friendly and accommodating! Kudos to Yaritza and Kaillah. Although the hotel was off the strip and is not considered first class, we were given AAA service.</p><br>Las Vegas 1st Visit<p>Very friendly and helpful staff.
One of the most comfortable beds in any hotel we have stayed. Very good breakfast.
A couple of negatives...the pool was closed for some city violation which was disappointing, and the hotel location requires a cab to the strip ($10 with tip), unless you enjoy a long walk. You can also take the hotel shuttle to the Wynn hotel and walk to your destination.
We would consider staying at the Fairfield with our next visit. There are NO resort fees!!!
Room Tip: Request a room in the back, away from S. Paradise Road noise. Since you are near the airport, the ta...

Front desk personnel were very friendly and welcoming. Beds were comfortable and rooms were clean. Would stay here again.</p><br>Great value just off the strip<p>A really good find just off the craziness of the LV strip.. This hotel is quiet and offers all you need for a comfortable stay. Friendly staff, full breakfast with eggs, waffles and more, free wi-fi, free parking, pool, small gym, and snack shop. Really good option if you want to be near everything but don't want the noise, smoke and extra charges of a hotel on the strip. Quiet rooms and comfortable beds. I'll definitely consider staying here again.</p><br></body></html>
