Next I called them on my cell phone and let it ring 25 times or so again no answer. Walked downstairs and the employees (six of them) were in the owners/supervisors office. I asked why no one was answering the phone. Because I didn’t let it ring long enough? I asked how many rings were acceptable. The answer was MORE. I then said our TV had no signal. They sent me back to my room to work on the TV as they were busy answering the phones. I did as asked and the TV didn’t work. She then said “are you sure” I said yes. Then she said do I have to come up and fix it as you don’t seem to be able to. Now there is a plethora of answers I could have come up with but I just said “yes, that would be nice as the news isn’t on and I would like to watch it.” She came up and after a few minutes said “the TV doesn’t work.” Said she would see if it could be fixed and left. The maintenance man was very nice and tried many things. He finally replaced the TV with one from a room being remodeled after 4 hours. Things worked fine after that. Four hours of my vacation I will never get back.

Now the hotel offers free transportation from the airport to the hotel. My mother is 80 and called the hotel phone number for transportation. Our direction from the tour group we were with was calling the number when you get in for a ride. Now from my previous calls to the front desk my mom had the same experience. They didn’t answer again and so I walked down again and asked to have my mother picked up. The answer was “NO, unless she called herself and talked to the receptionist.” I had her on the phone and the receptionist said again she had to call and couldn’t talk to her on my cell phone. I asked my mother where she was and she didn’t know. I told her to get a cab and we would pay for it as after two late flights and now these forget the silliness. I also asked and the shuttle would have been an hour as they just left the airport and were headed to the strip to pick up and drop off gamblers. Now there was a shift change and the front desk did pay $20 of the cab fare which was very kind of them to do.

Nice view of parking lots and razor wire, not a place I will ever stay again.
Room Tip: A different hotel as a seedy part of town. Asked the police where to shop and was told to get a bus...

Also woke up with a big welt on my leg from a spider bite. Iinfored the lady at the front desk as I was leaving.</p><br>Great value<p>Excellent staff, modern, comfortable, well maintained rooms and property. I stay here several times a month so the modern comfortable rooms always help with a great nights rest. The free breakfast bar is always a nice way to start the morning. The hotel does provide transportation to the airport and the strip.</p><br>Worst Marriott stay ever<p>First off in a platinum member and this is by far the worst hotel stay I've had.. No hot water, shuttle service was a joke, and the customer service was very poor, no one answers a phone at this location</p><br>very good location<p>the location on Paradise Road is an excellent location. Nice surroundings, good places to eat nearby, close to the strip but off strip. Front desk staff are excellent, especially a lady who goes by KT on the front desk. Very accommodating.
Room Tip: we had a problem getting hot water a few times in our room. The outdoor pool is not heated and very...
See more room tips</p><br>Oct short trip<p>Got partially handicapped room, was told only about the railings not the shower. Computer to print boarding passes was broken. Took front desk 10 minutes to print. Check in took forever.
Room was set for 60 degrees, was an ice box on check in</p><br>Great stay Great location<p>I stayed here last week for a softball tourney in LV. The hotel is in a great location off the strip but close to everything I needed to do Friendly staff and clean room. The parking lot was being resurfaced while I was there. A minor inconvenience, but not a big deal. Plenty of parking. The lot looked great when it was done on Saturday. Staff were friendly.
I saw some reviewers complain about the area east of the hotel. Yes, not the greatest, but then you would have to complain about every hotel in the area then, strip included. NOT AN ISSUE!!
Again, enjoyed the stay and I'll be back! :)</p><br>Not our typical Marriott experience - BAD<p>Most staff were nice but we received atrocious customer service from a staff member when my husband requested hot water for tea and then a tea bag. She acted as though he was bothering her judging by her sighs. We also had intermittant hot water for showering and when my husband called the front desk he was given the solution of running the faucet in the sink. We went right down the street to the Marriott Chateau...hope this experience will be better!</p><br>wonderful<p>I have stayed at Fairfield Inn many times and every time its amazing service. I mostly travel for bussines and my wife and child come with. They love staying here while im out for work. Its close to everything and the staff is very helpful</p><br>Nice and Simple<p>Stayed here on a Monday night due to a cancelled flight and it was a pleasant surprise to be greeted by friendly staff after arriving on the airport courtesy shuttle. Was quickly checked in and my room was just a short walk down the first floor hall. Room was clean and relatively nice. Had simple interior design and plenty of amenities for the casual traveler. Hotel seemed pretty quiet and I slept well. Only two complaints during my short stay are the pillows are awful, I just couldn't get comfortable with them until I was just too tired and passed out. The second is that the hotels wake up system was apparently not working and it almost caused me to miss my already rescheduled flight, only saving was the call I got because I was missing my scheduled shuttle otherwise I would have missed my flight for sure. Overall it was a great off strip hotel.</p><br></body></html>
