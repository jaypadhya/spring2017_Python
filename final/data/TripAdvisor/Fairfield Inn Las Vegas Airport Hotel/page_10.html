<html><head><h3>Fairfield Inn Las Vegas Airport Hotel Reviews Page 10</h3></head><body><br>Fantastic for those without a vehicle!<p>I stayed at this hotel in March 2012. I chose this hotel because it was a Fairfield Inn by Marriott, with complimentary WiFi, complimentary buffet breakfast, and complimentary shuttle service to/from the airport and to/from the Las Vegas strip. I was in town for four days to visit my dying grandmother in nearby Boulder City, and to film along the Las Vegas strip for a final class project.

The staff was absolutely excellent in their outstanding customer service. Everyone was great! I asked for a quiet room at check-in, and the front desk clerk graciously placed me away from the street towards the back of the hotel, which I appreciated. I never had service, but the room was well maintained and cleaned prior to my arrival. The shuttle driver was a remarkable man who took care of me on every trip into the strip. As a young woman traveling on her own, he was kind and courteous, and even dropped me off at the Convention Center, which was off his routine stops, when I was attending a showing of Phantom of the Opera at the Venetian so that I would be closer to my destination.

This trip was an emotional one for me, between visiting my dying grandmother via transit to Boulder City and compiling/editing footage for a college final project. The staff made my stay comfortable and smooth, and always had excellent suggestions in terms of restaurants and attractions.

The hotel is close enough to the attractions and nightlife of the Las Vegas strip. The shuttle service is perfect in that you hardly need a vehicle to get around that area or to the airport.</p><br>Excellent Customer Service<p>From check in to the van operator it was a typical Marriott customer experience.......excellent!
We will definetelty come back to this location. Highly recommended for a quick or long stay business or pleasure trip.
Room Tip: Well situated to the Strip and the Airport.
See more room tips</p><br>Decent Hotel<p>Wasn't too far from the strip, which is nice if you're looking for a cheap stay near it. Rooms were nice. Free breakfast in the morning was good. Got woken up early in the morning by the banging of the garbage truck on the property next door. Staff was friendly. Elevator seemed a bit weird, making weird noises and rattling at times.</p><br>nicely updated<p>Really nice, newly renovated Fairfield Inn. I stayed here for a quick overnight. Room was really nice with really comfortable beds. Everything looked newly redone and had a great look!
The only minor issue was the sink was clogged the entire time we were there and the water took a while to drain!</p><br>Great location, service &amp; very clean.<p>Really enjoyed staying here. When I told them my husband was in the hospital, they gave me a discount which helped me out a lot during this difficult time. Staff was very friendly, the amenities were great and the rooms were nice & clean. The hotel was very close to the strip so it would be a good place to stay if visiting Las Vegas on a leisure trip.</p><br>Great for Business Traveler<p>I've been staying at the Fairfield Inn for twenty-some years because it is always clean, quiet, and friendly. The latest redecoration makes for a very comfortable environment. Plenty of restaurant options are within walking distance. This is the place for a business traveler in Las Vegas.</p><br>Great hotel<p>We loved that they are all non smoking. Hotel is very new, decorated well, very clean and pleasant staff. The breakfast had anything one could want. The location is great for the airport. Very pleased overall and a great value!</p><br>A Business Travelers Gem<p>Stayed for one night and was EXTREMELY happy. CLEAN, COMFORTABLE, CONVIENENT and COURTEOUS staff......it met my 4 "C"s. Great and punctual shuttle transportation to/from airport and will also do on demand shuttle to the strip (drop off at Wynn hotel). Newly renovated hotel with nice in room amenities (microwave and fridge). Will definitely stay there again. KT at the front desk was so pleasant and responsive such a breath of fresh air! You can't go wrong with this hotel.</p><br>Basketball<p>I was very happy with me stay at the Fairfield. Hotel was new, clean and very nice. I really enjoyed it was a smoke free property. There was a restaurant right next and the food was really good. I'll stay there again. Next time i'll have my family with me.</p><br>Perfect Place for airport transfers.<p>Great hotel! Rooms were nice. We flew to Las Vegas as a first stop on our trip to Yellowstone. They have a transfer bus to and from the airport. We got in very late our second time staying there, and they got us right into our room and offerred to let us have a late checkout since we weren't flying until later in the day. Breakfast was fantastic, bus was prompt each time. Thanks Fairfield Inn!!</p><br></body></html>
