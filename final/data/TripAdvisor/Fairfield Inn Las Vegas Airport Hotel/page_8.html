<html><head><h3>Fairfield Inn Las Vegas Airport Hotel Reviews Page 8</h3></head><body><br>Great Value<p>This was a very welcome respite from the craziness of the Strip. It's a very nice and comfortable hotel, and conveniently located - not too far from the Strip. Even though airplanes fly overhead, the inside was (surprisingly) reasonably quiet. It was recently remodeled, and everything was fresh and clean. The beds and pillows were very comfortable. Room amenities included a microwave and mini-fridge. The daily breakfast spread off the lobby was extensive; everything from cereals, breads, pastries, fresh fruit, scrambled eggs and sausage, and just about anything else one would want for breakfast. A terrific value for everything you get!</p><br>Vegas on the cheap<p>If your trying to do vegas on the cheap and don't mind being a few blocks off the strip then here you must be. You don't come here for the parking lot pool or the small gym. You come here for the clean updated rooms, which have microwaves and a in room fridge . The free breakfast in the morning is good and the staff snd very friendly. Next door is "beer and taco" restaurant and its happy hour menu for food and drink is a nice place to go. Be forewarned to get to the strip is a bit of a walk but the money saved is worth it and if you change your mind cabs are every where.</p><br>Nice Hotel<p>Great rooms uniquely styled (for a chain hotel). They had a great breakfast the usual, scrambled eggs, sausage, breads, and fruit. The staff was very friendly. They have a great 24 hour fitness center with room key access. It is located about a mile off the strip with cab fare running between 10 to 20 dollars anywhere on the strip. There are restaurants/bars within the vicinity great place to stay away form the hustle and bustle of the strip.</p><br>excellent<p>Hotel staff is great, helful and the morning meal was fresh, hot and lots of items to choose from, fbetter than I expected, the night staff was very helpful chech us in quickly and made the trip start on a very good note. Thanks
Room Tip: great hotel, great staff
See more room tips</p><br>Great place off the strip<p>Great hotel just a short walk or ride to the strip. Much quieter without all the hoopla. Complimentary shuttle from/to the airport. Also a complimentary shuttle to the LV strip. Check-in was fast and friendly. Very nice lobby with complimentary coffee any time, Rooms are decorated nicely, large comfortable beds, with free wifi, flat screen tv, small fridge and microwave. Very well kept bathroom also. Considering this is Las Vegas, noise from the surrounding rooms is virtually non existent. Complimentary breakfast is also included with plenty of choices. Eggs, sausage, fresh cut fruit, cereal, waffles, juices, milk, a variety of breads and muffins. Plenty of food to get one started on the right foot. Free parking is also available. There is also a fitness center and outdoor pool, to cool off in when the weather is hot or even when it is not. Plenty of restaurants to choose from near the hotel. All in all, a nice place to stay.
Room Tip: Top floor is the best, no one walking above you.
See more room tips</p><br>Save money and take the cab!<p>I was able to get 2 rooms booked for a conference trip that turned into a mini family reunion in Las Vegas. It was a little off the Strip but the taxi was about $15 per trip and I think the dollar saved by not staying at the big hotels on the Strip more than made up for it. The breakfast was also pretty good, the front desk staff was helpful.
Room Tip: Ask for rooms away from the main road (Paradise Road). There were some good restaurants within walki...
See more room tips</p><br>Nice hotel close to the strip.<p>I stayed here for 4 days during my birthday week. My room was clean and comfortable. Free breakfast is included and there are a few restaurants within walking distance. They offer a free shuttle to and from the airport. The shuttle doesn't start until around 5 am, so if you have a super early flight and need to leave before then, you'll have to grab a cab. The shuttle will take you to the Wynn, however it doesn't run consistently (like at every top or bottom of the hour). Good luck catching a driver between airport runs. Internet was pretty slow and I wish the room had a mini fridge. Overall though it was a good stay at a good price.</p><br>I'm coming back soon!!<p>The service and staff were generous and always greeted my with a smile. K.T., Kayla and the rest of the staff were very respectful and helpful with whatever I needed...just very informative, considering that this was my first time in Las Vegas but, I can guarantee you that it won't be my last.</p><br>Helpful<p>Hotel staff very helpful. Husband is handicapped and we did not travel with his wheelchair. Hotel had one on hand and we were able to use it without a charge. Rooms were clean spacious.
Wew Would definately stay there again.</p><br>Delightful<p>This hotel was worth the stay. Great staff clean rooms the shuttle service is great. Breakfast in the morning is always a plus and I was able to use the office area and print out my tickets to a last minute concert Thanks Fairfield!</p><br></body></html>
