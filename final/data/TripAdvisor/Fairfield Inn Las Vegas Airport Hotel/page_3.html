<html><head><h3>Fairfield Inn Las Vegas Airport Hotel Reviews Page 3</h3></head><body><br>Vegas<p>The hotel staff are excellent! KT was pleasant and extremely helpful. She told us where everything was and asked us if we needed anything else. The room was clean but I didn't like the location. It seemed like it was on the edge of the the ghetto.</p><br>Excellent location<p>Great location and staff. Love this property! Plenty of food options, short walk to the strip and van service if you need it.
The staff, from the front desk to the airport van, is very helpful and professional. I can never thank them all enough.</p><br>Is this a Marriott property or Motel 6?<p>Very disappointing stay.

Upon arrival, the lady at front desk was friendly, but "harried", when I was asking for a map and other information about shuttle service, etc. She stated she was too busy and that she would call my room when things calmed down. At that point, another patron came to the front desk complaining her coffee maker didn't work in her room. As I got settled in my room, I waited about an hour when I decided to call the front desk to find out if where they put the coffee maker, microwave and fridge. (It was "hidden" and looked like a closet, not a place for these amenities). As I was asking, she told me to hurry up because she had other problems to deal with. I have traveled the world, and have stayed hundreds of Marriott properties, but in all that time, no one has EVER told a guest to hurry up b/c they didn't have time to answer. Again, it was in a friendly tone, but if there is too much to do at this hotel, then there needs to be another person there to help. OR hire someone that can manage a frenetic pace. I'm not sure what the issue was, but I felt like treated like cattle and not as a guest.

The bathroom was also less than appealing. The water never got hot enough in the shower. The shower head was old and clogged up and the spray was not even. The shower curtain had black marks on it, that showed it was old and dirty, The bathroom wall corner were full of dust. One set of towels was old and had no absorbency while the other was new => totally inconsistent. Again, very surprising for the level of quality I expect from a Marriott property. This felt more like a Motel 6.
Room Tip: Extremely loud bar/restaurant next door (Firefly), try to get room opposite side of building. On sec...

The cloth couch in my room was filled with stains and I found a receipt from a previous guest sticking out from between the cushion and the arm. The bed was ok. The decor was tacky, but maybe that is just Vegas. The Elevator was slow and ancient. Customer service was great but the place feels very "budget".</p><br>Clean, consistent<p>Helpful staff, breakfast buffet a bit crowded, housekeeping woke us up at 8:00 with a knock, garbage pick up at 7am, thin walls.



The end. I have no more to write but need to fill the space in order to submit.</p><br>Fairfield Inn Las Vegas Airport 3850 South Paradise Road, Las Vegas, NV<p>Friendly hotel very near the Las Vegas Airport. Free shuttle service to the strip. Shuttle is best way to get there because of parking. Free hot breakfast. Free Wi-Fii. Friendly staff. Nice fresh cozy rooms. Very clean. Comfortable nights sleep!
Room Tip: Higher rooms have better views
See more room tips</p><br>Hotel saying they offer a shuttle service is a lie !!<p>This hotel offers a "free shuttle service". They have one vehicle doing two terminals at the airport, the convention center and the strip. I called today for pickup and was told 20min. 58 min later, I got to the hotel. Second time this week! They need two vehicles during busy periods or pay for cabs. Marriott Corp should take action as this is damaging their brand. I am a multi-year Platinum with Marriott and have reduced my stays at this hotels because of this ridiculous service. I have now signed up for Starwood and am alternating stays with the Westin now. Just not worth the rate.
Room Tip: Avoid this hotel

Rooms are spacious, clean and quiet. Breakfast selection good. Small pool is clean and not to busy. Check in staff are very helpful and efficient. I would definitely stay here again.</p><br>Clean, comfortable and classy<p>We stayed just overnight passing through town. It was so nice to have a clean comfortable bed awaiting us when we arrived. The breakfast in the morning was fantastic. The staff was super helpful. The prices was worth not messing with a big, smokey casino check in.</p><br></body></html>
