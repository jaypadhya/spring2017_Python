<html><head><h3>Fairfield Inn Las Vegas Airport Hotel Reviews Page 23</h3></head><body><br>Very nice place<p>We stayed in this hotel for 3 nights..Spent 2 days in Las vegas and made a day trip to the grand canyon. The hotel is comfortable, rooms are clean and well maintained. The breakfast was good. It is about 10 miles from the airport and10 miles from the strip. They have free shuttle service to the airport and strip through out the day. They go to only 2 places in the strip near to bellagio and mirage..You can also take the local bus that goes on the strip if you want to go to MGM etc which is a little away..the bus costs 7 USD per person for 24 hrs and is very convenient..I would highly recommend this place for people travelling with kids..The hotel staff gave us milk for my son late at night when their kitchen was closed. We had the double double bed room..which is of course smaller than the queen bed..</p><br>Perfect Spot off the Strip<p>The hotel staff was always pleasant. Shuttle to and from airport and strip saved us lots of money. Shuttle driver tipped us off that first night Ruth Chris next door offered a late night 50% off happy hour at the bar... perfect fit after a long night of travel. Breakfast was and added bonus. Didn't use the pool, gym could use a little sprucing up. Thea/c in our room did make a lot of noise, but if you drank enough on the strip you'd barley notice :) Front desk printed our boarding passes and held our bags until we departed at 9pm. All in all a good fit for us, beats staying in hotel on the strip and walking 20 miles to your room!</p><br>Very good location, comfortable and affordable for short stay/trip<p>I stayed here around 1 year back and had a very comfortable stay for 2 nights. Close to all attractions. Also close to the airport.

Very good service and clean rooms with comfort stay. I would recommend this for anybody who is travelling to Las vegas particularly it has some good Indian restaurants near by, something like Indias Gandhi cuisine etc.
Also this hotel has shuttle to airport every 30 mins or so and helpful staffs with economical cost.</p><br>great<p>It was great staying in fairfield inn, There was frequent pick up and drop services provided.
and staff was good .. gave enough knowledge of las vegas so we can go around..
nice breakfast..
In all it was a great stay at fairfield inn</p><br>Satisfactory for the business traveler<p>I stayed here one night on a business trip. The hotel was satisfactory. The room was clean though a bit small. The AC/Heat worked fine and was quiet. Check--in was easy. The eliptical trainer in the exercise room needed service but was usable. The bright spot was the breakfast... While mostly typical fare, there was soy milk and other non-dairy items that suited my diet. The location is a plus, not by the airport, but only 4 blocks behind the Strip. The price was right and included breakfast.</p><br>Good for one-night stay<p>First time at this property, but have stayed at other Fairfield Inns before, as well as many other properties in Las Vegas. Just here for a stop en route. Slept, showered, ate a quick breakfast, and left. Room was small, but fine for what we needed. This is not a resort. Lobby computers not useful as the large screen will broadcast your doings for all to see. Breakfast suffers same problem as many of these sorts of motels--kids fingering items on buffet and then leaving them on the buffet--yuck factor. I stick with coffee, yogurt, and a banana. Nice towels in the room. Need in-room guide to TV channels--we did not have one. Basic place good for a quick stop.</p><br>Would have enjoyed it except for unpleasant front desk experience<p>Pros: Clean room; friendly shuttle staff especially Glen & Brandon; very helpful staff at breakfast area; cleaning lady very polite

Con: Front desk clerk (Deanna) was not pleasant at all. Even corrected me about the hotel cancel policy. When I went to the front desk to check out last last May 3rd and I requested for a receipt, I was told I could not be given one because firstly, I prepaid the hotel room when I booked on April 25th. (My reservation had a cancel policy of 24 hrs. prior to arrival; I can't understand why I was told that my room had been paid for) ; secondly, Deanna told me that she could not issue me a receipt because I had booked the room through a third party. ( I booked the room through the Marriott reservation line. I am a Marriott rewards member.) She could not even tell me which credit card was used to pay for my room. I have 2 credit cards in the Marriott profile. After some more clarification and after another lady at the front desk jumped in to help Deanna, they did issue me a receipt. But no apologies whatsover for this unpleasant treatment of a guest. This is very unusual. I always patronize Marriott hotels because of the wonderul way they treat their guests. This is a first!! . Other than this unfortunate incident, I will still patronize Marriott hotels but may not go back to this Las Vegas property.</p><br>fairfield inn very helpful<p>this hotel was very nice friendly staff and the men that ran the shuttle were very nice and very very very helpful</p><br>Clean, great service, accessible to UNLV and The Strip<p>I attended a professional conference in Las Vegas. It was an overnight trip--flew in Friday morning and out Saturday early evening. The Fairfield is a great place to stay--affordable, clean, excellent service!, free breakfast, and very comfortable rooms.

They provided shuttle service from/to the airport and the Strip. They even gave me shuttle service to UNLV where my conference was held! The desk staff were always courteous and helpful. The shuttle drivers were knowledgeable and pleasant.

The room was very comfortable, clean and had everything I needed. I was concerned that there might be noise from partiers arriving in the hotel in the wee hours, but I slept through the night. The hotel is very quiet even though it is very near the airport and flight paths.

I would stay there again!</p><br>Excellent value off the strip<p>Very nice hotel if you are looking to stay off the strip. We were there for just one night before our early morning flight so worked fine. Nice included breakfast which is nice.</p><br></body></html>
