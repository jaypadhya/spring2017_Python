<html><head><h3>Extended Stay America - Las Vegas - East Flamingo Hotel Reviews Page 4</h3></head><body><br>Ask before you stay...<p>First and foremost, the staff is fantastic.. Appearance of this hotel is that it has been remodeled or is new. Don't let this fool you.. This hotel has been under renovation as far as outside, lobby and maybe new laundry rooms. I understand they are only able to renovate one room at a time, but I can guarantee you there are rooms that are not fit to stay in, until they get renovated. Had reservations for a couple of nights, got checked in an went to our room.. EWWWW! It was terrible... The stench of I don't know what was permeating out the door. Opened the door and the carpet was filthy, the couch was the most disgusting thing I had ever seen, cigarette holes in the comforter, just not a room I was interested in staying in for a couple of days. Went back downstairs and talked with the lady an she kindly put us up in another room. This room was very old, the newest thing in there was probably the flat screen.. Blankets again had cigarette burns in them and mind you, these were non smoking rooms. Counter had burn places in it, Formica peeling off table, shower handle goes all the way around, you have to be careful not to burn yourself.. Any way, being so tired from driving, we chose to keep the room for a couple of days. Enjoyed the pool, at least it was clean, beds were comfortable and staff is nice.
Room Tip: Ask to see your room before agreeing to taking it...

The staff was very pleasant and quickly responded to any requests. However, the dirty rugs, stained bathtub, damaged but repaired Formica table, and poor to no reception we had with our smartphones were issues we decided to tolerate because of the low rates. The pictures of the rooms on their website is far from the reality. We like the concept of Extended Stay America but wished this site was in better condition.</p><br>More Like Camping<p>Eating my dinner I realized that the lack of basic cooking items reminded me of camping. Simply not enough items to call it full equipped by any stretch of the imagination. A strainer, ladle, forks would have been nice.

The ADA room is inconvenient for anyone over 5 foot as the bathroom mirror and shower are not equipped a typical guest. They should get a mirror that works for both types of guests. In addition, because the shower handset is removable, have a bracket to place it where a taller guess could use it effectively. I simply held it the whole time.

Also, as a note to the staff, the sign indicating that the utensils are located in a wheelchair accessible location should not be posted on the inside of the cabinet above the stove. One, someone in a wheelchair could never reach that. Two, a typical person would open that cabinet last. Three, the wheelchair accessible cabinet is a little hidden (due to the room lighting) and not obvious. Just place the sign on the fridge.

Tragically there is no oven or toaster oven, but there is a toaster. Woman working the front desk was awesome. Very polite, well organized, and nice to every guest. Rooms are nice overall and they are clean.</p><br>Great staff, again!<p>That was my third time as their guest and again the staff was fantastic. I got too early to the hotel, it was a weekend and even so they managed to get me a early checkin. The room was clean and ready for me. The only thing about the room I would complain is that the bathroom could have more light. I highly recommend this property and I will have my parents staying there this week.</p><br>Good deal<p>I stayed for 2 nights. It was all I needed considering I spent most of my time on the strip for activities. It was a great place to lay my head! Free parking, free wifi, room was clean ( no housekeeping for short stay ), but that was ok, I don't make a mess. The kitchen was fully equipped. I got the studio queen bed room, it was enough space for me and my boyfriend, small but enough! The coffee was good, the free continental breakfast was enough to hold you over to get real breakfast. Can't beat the price! Close enough to the strip! I'd stay here again!
Room Tip: Good value!
See more room tips</p><br>Management and staff were extremely helpful and very nice.<p>I stayed here for 3 months. Everything was great from my room to the management and staff. Rooms have everything you need and location is perfect to downtown. The price was very reasonable as well. I highly recommend this Extended Stay Flamingo.</p><br>Great staff, average hotel, a little to far from the strip to walk.<p>The title sums it up nicely.

The staff is what put my stay over the top.

They were very accommodating and helpful. They even found me a place to check my bags after check out so I could wander around and sight see before my flight. I don't think that was standard operating procedure, but they made it happen and I commend them for it.
Room Tip: Only a $10-$15 cab ride to the strip.
See more room tips</p><br>Eh...<p>"Hotels" seem to be having a hard time with the basics lately. Like, for example, not selling a room as "non-smoking" when it's obviously been chain-smoked in. A sign on the table calling it non-smoking does not make it so. As I can't tolerate smoke, they did agree to move me to a different non-smoking room that only lightly smelled of smoke. "Well, people break the rules, and we can't stop them," a front desk employee informed me. Yes, people break rules, but then large charges usually appear on their credit cards, and the room is properly treated to remove the smoke, or not further sold as "non-smoking."

But, that was just my first impression. The hotel looks decent on the outside, and is across from a good diner and Olive Garden. Inside, the carpet is terribly stained, dirty beyond belief, and loose in some areas creating tripping hazards. Carpet in both rooms I looked at wasn't much better.

Otherwise, the room was adequate, relatively clean, spacious, and the AC worked. The pool was also small but relatively clean and refreshing. Of course, the "free internet" has strings (video ads), the "free breakfast" very basic (but available, and appreciated), and a remote control for the non-existent DVD player was a nice touch.

While I sound rather sour on this property, I was here for 3 nights, and didn't feel unsafe, or like I'd wake up to any new diseases. Not having room service for my stay was disappointing (I'd booked through an opaque site, so did not know about this in advance,) but the front desk did supply extra towels when I asked. Also, the front desk is not open 24 hours, but there was someone to check me in late.

I suppose I'd stay here again, particularly for the price I paid, but some minor touches (clean carpet) and slightly thicker towels, as well as a bit more attention to detail (the missing DVD player), and an attempt to filter the smoke smell out of the hallways would really bring this to the next level, or perhaps even to the 2.5 stars it was billed as...
Room Tip: Make sure to check the room to make sure that non-smoking really is, and wear a mask in the hallways...

The rooms are old and not clean. The carpet is full of cigarettes burns</p><br>Clean and very friendly<p>We only stayed for a quick overnight, but the staff was very informative about the surrounding area and they were friendly. Used it for transition from a road trip to the airport the next morning - it suited our needs. If you do not want to stay on the strip and would like to go to a hotel that does not have any slot machines I would strongly recommend this property for a short or longer term stay. It is nothing fancy - especially good if you have more than 4 in your family, which can be a problem in Vegas...</p><br></body></html>
