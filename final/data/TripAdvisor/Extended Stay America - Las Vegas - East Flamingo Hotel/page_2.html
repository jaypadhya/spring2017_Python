<html><head><h3>Extended Stay America - Las Vegas - East Flamingo Hotel Reviews Page 2</h3></head><body><br>WORST PLACE EVER!<p>I was extremely disappointed in this hotel. My flight was delayed so I did not get into Vegas till 4 am. Upon checking in, Peace, refused to check me because it was so late, saying that I'd have to leave (check-out at 11 am), even though I had booked online reservations for 4 nights. Fighting with a front desk clerk when you've traveled half way across the country in the middle of the night is not a good way to start your vacation!!!! She finally agreed to check us in when I had dug through my lunge and found my reservation paper. Word to the wise, I thought they take the money out of your account when you book it, but buyer beware, they DO NOT TAKE MONEY OUT TILL YOU PHYSICALLY CHECK IN!!! EVEN THOUGH WHEN YOU BOOK ONLINE IT SAYS PAID. In the morning I had to drag cookware upstairs along with extra bedding. Who on their vacation wants to be carrying storage containers down hallways on vacation!!! Along with trash, I took my bag of trash down to the front desk to give to them to dispose of, all Cindy did was point me in the direction of the trash cans. The breakfast is JOKE!!! There is coffee, two types of cereal bars and oatmeal with no milk nor any bowls to cook in!!!! Then they promptly remove the coffee at end of breakfast time. I asked for directions to the red rock canyon and the front desk clerk did not know how to look them up on Google at the very least. Had to explain to him every step. SPEND YOUR MONEY ELSEWHERE!!!!!</p><br>Dingy Hotel, False Advertisement<p>I don't know how this place won a Trip Advisor Excellence award in 2014, that's scary. When I walked in, it was early around 11:30 am,the first thing the manager Cindy did was look at the clock. I paid for a one bedroom suite. I was placed in a King studio and charged same price for a king one bedroom suite. I was told by Cindy they don't have one bedroom King suites, which was a lie, they do but they have extra mattresses in them and supplies. Like they made those rooms extra supply rooms. I called and made sure this was actually a one bedroom through the corporate reservations. After walking around the property, I noticed there were one bedrooms. When I questioned why I wasn't in the room I paid for and requested Cindy raised her voice and seemed a bit angry that I questioned her. I want what I paid for. So then she explains that those rooms are booked up because of March Madness and I can check availability on Sunday. Sunday comes around and I talk to the assistant manager who states she needs to charge me at pet fee per Cindy. Cindy the manager had seen myself at least three times and my service animal paperwork and my notes when I booked had information for the service animal. My mother is disabled & so am I. Our vehicle has disabled plates, but Cindy still tried to get her assistant manager to charge me a fee. How unprofessional when Cindy saw the paperwork and my service animal certificate. I finally was placed in a one bedroom with two double beds. Still not what I paid for or booked per website. The hotel was dirty and dingy. Beware of the windows they pull out, yes out. They come off. So if you are traveling with small children then this is something you need to be aware of the windows will come out and could cause injury to you/child/animal. You could fall out thru the window. Very dangerous. I brought this to Cindy attention, she just said okay. She didn't send anyone up to look or nothing. It was like she knew and didn't care. I took pictures and video. Everything looked dirty. I personally wiped down several doors with my own disinfectant because it was that gross. Touching the stair rails and doors in this place was scarier then walking at night in a crime infested neighborhood. I was really scared I would get sick with something that would need a hospital visit. Breakfast was nothing. Coffee, orange, apple, Nature Valley granola bars, that's it. No juice or milk, nothing. Red Roof Inn had a better breakfast and cleaner. The air conditioner in our room was ancient & at $700.00 a week. I expected way more. Only reason I stayed was because it was March Madness and everything else was booked or way overpriced for a basic room. Cindy is not a personable person, trustworthy, and seems like she has no integrity. I do not recommend this hotel because they will put you in the wrong room and still charge the same price. I am looking into this on a higher level to ensure no one is treated like we were. Something is going on and I will get to the bottom of it. Tried to call the "general manger" Doug to no avail.</p><br>best<p>everything was best and the staff were very generous, helpful and welcoming

Thank you for everything. next time I will visit this hotel</p><br>Perfect long-term stay<p>One of the finest places we have ever stayed out. Customer service outstanding. Nice starter breakfast every day. Wi-fi worked great. Printer in lobby for guests' use. Pool, too. Very clean and quiet. ,Walking distance to grocery stores, CVS, Skechers outlet and even the Library. Easy parking. Excellent rates, too. Would like to thank the Manager, Cindy, and all of the employees, especially Christian, Neesha and the other front-desk workers.
Room Tip: We like room close to the lobby but it really doesn't matter as the parking is available at all...
See more room tips</p><br>Pleasant<p>We came out to Vegas for Jamz. With the kids this is a great stay for a good price. I had a kitchen and a nice spacious room. At reception Nakia was great to us. Our room was clean, spacious, well lit, everything was functional. I would definitely consider it on next Vegas trip.</p><br>Awful and dirty<p>Despicable dump that should have been demolished years ago.
Incredible smells that permeate from the rooms, like a boarding house in downtown Delhi.
Old, tired furniture and rags for towels leave this incredibly bad lodging at the top 10 of worst hotels in Las Vegas.
Front office staff could not care less and a non existent housekeeping department makes this place ready for demolition.
Room Tip: Avoid this dump like the plague.
See more room tips</p><br>Non-smoking room wreaked of cigarettes.<p>We were supposed to have a non-smoking room, didn't notice the cigarette smell when we checked in late evening. I had to shut the door between the living room/kitchen & the bedroom because the fridge was so loud. When I went out to kitchen in the a.m. It wreaked of cigarettes. Floors in both the kitchen & bathroom were sticky. We were also supposed to have a TV in both the living room & bedroom - the one in the bedroom was missing. Overflowing trash bins were in the corridors throughout the property. Overall, not the best experience we've had, worst Las Vegas stay ever. Fortunately we were able to get a room at the Palms Resort for our second night.</p><br>Cheap rate for Suite hotel<p>Lets be reasonable, if you are looking for a cheap rate and ready to give up a few of Vacation Dreams this is a great place other wise if you dream of a nice vacation this is not the place to be.
Lets go first to the good side. Friendly staff. Suite has small kitchenette . comfortable rooms. Linen was clean.
On the other hand; Our room was very smelly. every time we opened the door the odor hit us in the face. After a few minutes we got used to it. The lights were dingy especially in the bathroom. A few bulbs did not work. Windows were not clean. I visited an other room where my friend stayed and it did not have this smell. The surrounding are is not a place where you want to go for a walk especially in the evening.
If you do come here ask for a room that has a door between the kitchen and bedroom. this will eliminate the odor of the kitchen and if someone wants to do something in the kitchen while others want to sleep they can shut the door.
Bottom line we came for work not for enjoyment so we were overall happy with the low price. For a nice vacation look somewhere else.
Room Tip: Rooms that have a door separating Kitchenette from bedroom. Also smell the odor of the room before t...
See more room tips</p><br>Ok so far<p>Checked in yesterday on the start of a stay for a couple weeks. Everyone was very nice. The room was not ready but we were very early. While they got the room ready, they let me hide in the breakfast area and use the wi-fi for some personal business. The room is clean. It is a smoking room since it was the last one they had (CES show in town) but it did not even smell bad. Room is a little beat up and could use a handy man to roam around and do some repairs. As for the trip, OK so far.
Room Tip: The neighborhood is a little scary late at night, but you should be inside by then anyway. Stayed in...
