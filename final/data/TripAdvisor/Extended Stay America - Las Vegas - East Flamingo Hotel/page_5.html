<html><head><h3>Extended Stay America - Las Vegas - East Flamingo Hotel Reviews Page 5</h3></head><body><br>Business in Las Vegas<p>I stayed for several weeks at the Extended Stay on E. Famingo Road. It was just off the strip (just over a mile) and close to UNLV. The room was a nice size, with a kitchen & accessories. The room needed some updating, but while I was there renovations were happening at the hotel, including new equipment in the exercise room. The staff was the biggest plus for staying. They were just great and service oriented. Every request was followed up on in a curteous and timely manner. I felt safe at the hotel, but the area around the hotel was urban and not a resort area, so be vigilant.

Room Tip: Ask for a room toward the front of the hotel.

The manager and the staff were very friendly and helpfull. I had lot of mail and some arrived a few days before me. They kept it safe for me until I arrived. Thanks ESA!</p><br>st. patricks weekend 2013<p>Extended Stay America saved me from an unwanted night with no sleep in vegas. I had booked a room at the clairmont but they tried to charge me for fees that were not posted on their website when I said I would pay cash they wouldn't let me stay after several hours of looking for a room in vegas on st. patricks day weekend this year the extended stay america was the only place with one room left. The customer service lady was a gem and held my room so I could get over there. the room was clean the staff was friendly and it was a quiet night of sleep when I finally got checked in. would highly recommend it especially if your going to be staying longer than just a night.</p><br>At the high end of low-cost weekly places<p>Staff is very helpful. Everything is pretty much as advertised. Thanks Darius for your help on the last day of my stay. I appreciate the room layout; the kitchen, though tiny, is plenty for one. An ordinary overstuffed chair to watch TV in at the end of the day is great--much better than watching from the bed. I liked the flatscreen TV, and especially appreciated the DVD player. Pool was small but warm enough for swimming in March. Having stayed in a number of weekly places (under $500/week), and monthly places ($1500/month); this was overall the best match of value, service, convenience, and privacy. So many weekly places have exterior access to the units, which means all the windows face walkways which means zero privacy if the drapes are open. This place has an interior hallways--and elevators (THANKS), so I can have natural light and not lose my privacy. Laundromat is easy and accessible, parking lot is laid out well and lighted well.
Room Tip: The single studios are really appropriate for one as there's only one chair to watch tv from; ge...
See more room tips</p><br>Perfect<p>I suggested my aunt and uncle stay here as they would in Las Vegas for almost 3 weeks. I joined them for four days about a week into their stay. The amenities were perfect for their needs, they were treated with kindness and respect and smiles. They had a 2nd floor room near the elevator which was good for their limitations, and I had a room down the hall from them, which enabled me to mosey down the hall for lengthy visits. Though my room looked a bit aged around the edges, it was more than adequate for my needs and truly felt like home away from home.

A shout out to Deborah, night staff, who helped me print out my boarding pass. Thanks also to Jolene. All the taff were courtesy and friendly. Checkout was quick, great.

Often though, you would have to wait for someone to come to the front desk. You can call 0 on the phone and someone would pop out from a room down the hall.

I didn't look at the pool, but the front grounds were well kept and colorful with spring flowers. Thank you so much to those who took such great care in meeting the needs of my aunt and uncle -- I know they appreciated it. And the to-go breakfasts were ideal.
Room Tip: I clicked on ratings for kids activities and restaurant, though I can't rate...just needed to do...
