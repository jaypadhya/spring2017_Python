I would defenatly stay here again!!!</p><br>THE place to stay when you want to avoid the strip chaos<p>I'm traveling to Las Vegas for close to 30 years and have stayed at most hotels, I basically switched to a new place almost every time, but not after I stayed at The Extended Stay Deluxe on East Flamingo, the facility, the staff, the service was beyond what one could expect, forget about the price, it is indeed the most inexpensive one in this class, I would give them a 20 start rating but there Isn't more then 5. The 2 managers Doug and Gen are top in the class, they go OUT OF THEIR WAY to give you a pleasant stay. Keep it up. Looking forward for many more stays.

Max L.</p><br>CUSTOMER SERVICE<p>The hotel is very nice, especially the personal running it. The manager Genevive, and her staff were always friendly and helpful and concerned for their travelers. Jolene, Ann and Britany are all great. Jolene especially goes the extra mile to help everyone!</p><br>Great service, friendly staff.<p>Stayed at this hotel for four nights and I am very pleased with my stay. The whole hotel is clean and the staff is friendly. We got helped numerous times by the front desk representative, Angie. She was always prompt, very helpful, friendly and lovely to talk to. My friend and I would definately stay here again due to Angie's and the other representatives service and cleanliness of the hotel.</p><br>Clean and Comfortable.<p>SCOOTER B
This hotel has met all of my wife and I expectations. We recently relocated to Las Vegas and was looking for an extended place to stay until we could find something more permanent. In addition,I was having major surgeries and also needed somewhere to rehabilitate. The staff here has been exceptional with great customer service skills and supplying my wife and I with what we need. I recommend this particular location to anyone seeking an short term stay to check out the activities on the strip,at an affordable price.In additioon to anyone seeking a temporary,extended living situation.</p><br></body></html>
