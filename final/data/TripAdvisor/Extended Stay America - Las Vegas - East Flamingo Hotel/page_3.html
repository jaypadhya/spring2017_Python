They didn't listen to our requests for accommodation for our disabilities, nor did they tell us about the $100 deposit. On arrival placed on 3rd floor across the hotel from the elevator ( I have mobility issues.) Bathroom so dim that a tea light candle would have made it brighter. Was promised a retroactive military discount when I checked out because they missed that too when we called. Checked out this morning and the desk staff was rude and unaccommodating. Refused to give the promised military discount. And when we pulled back the covers to make sure we got everything found we had been sleeping with bed bugs. Never ever staying there again</p><br>Very Disappointed<p>Let me start off by saying we use Trip advisor as a way to know if the place we will stay is going to be ok. This is probably my first horrible experience of this nature. Using the method of the Excellent, Very Good and Average compared to the poor and terrible. Using this method, we have never been led astray until this time. I'm not sure who is posting the 5 and 4 stars but it has to be in house. Working in the travel business, I understand the importance of ratings and how important it is to get those in order for people to come and support your business. For this to be a well known establishment, I was totally disappointed in the overall stay. From one of the front desk attendants to everything else it was a horrible experience. First of all, I should have known there was an issue when I asked can I see the room first because we had never stayed at this particular hotel before. She indicated we were unable to. We were originally staying at this location for 5 nights. I asked Ashley if we could use my first credit card to do the authorization and any deposit on and then I would pay either cash or my debit card upon check out. After going around and around with trying to explain that, her response was no. The system only lets you book the room and you can't change it once it's in. I've NEVER heard of this. She said it's the "rule" at this location, I said so if someone has to leave or an incident occurs then what happens. She said it had to be approved and then they would be able to see what they can do....Also we were told if you want to cook, you have to ask for any utensils and cookware and then we take it upstairs... Interesting... Hawthorne Suites and other hotel chains like this have the items in the room. This is supposed to be a selling point of "extended stay" hotels. I just left it alone since we were going to be staying the entire time... Or so we thought!! We went to our room on the 3rd floor. When I tell you I felt like I was going through a bad dream and twilight zone that's putting it mildly. The first layer of smell was a horrible waste smell, as though there was feces or something in the hall, that's how bad it was. The carpet is worn, tattered and some places during the hall sunken in. The next "layer" smell was an unusual bad smell. It wasn't food, it wasn't body odor, it was very distinct but not describable. Still, we weren't at our room. Once we entered the room.. .that's definitely what it was... a room. Old furnishing, outdated completely, the microwave was the old fashion kind. The bed. What would best describe the bed would be..... an IRONING BOARD. I think an ironing board at least has some cushion and give. Once I remember having to stay at a Motel 6 and even in that place for $36 they had cushion in the bed. This room was $89.. .$89 and definitely not worth even HALF of this amount. The bed was horrible, the room wasn't cleaned properly. There were pieces of paper in the bathroom and in the kitchen area from most likely a previously checked out guest. I honestly didn't take my clothes off to get in the bed because I was afraid it wasn't sterilized properly. The towels feel like sandpaper and very thin. My husband and I only stayed because we called all around and there wasn't anything available in the area. "I know surprising since there are many hotels" but there was 2 conventions going on so the first night was a no go. The icing on the cake was the fact that we noticed traffic coming up and down the hall. The last time we heard the traffic, I opened the door to see a young lady scantly dressed and noticeably obvious when she asked us a question and then sauntered into a room down the hall that was left open for her. We toughed it out till morning and when we went to check out, the young lady kept asking why we were leaving so soon. I had only mentioned the bed and there was an excuse for that. I said something about the cleanliness and you would think I was saying something out of the norm, so we decided that it was best to write this review to help others. The most that I'm upset about is the reviews. Be honest, tell people what to expect and don't mislead others into thinking this is a good place when really it's sub par. Spend some of the "VEGAS" money and remodel this place. It could be a nice place if someone really cared!
Room Tip: NONE, I have no more words
See more room tips</p><br>Eight nights in Vegas<p>I arrived by Car around 4:00 PM Saturday afternoon after driving from central Saskatchewan. Considering some of the reviews I have read, I apparently had a very good stay. I was checked in by a young guy who was extremely polite. And not very helpful. Only thing I could see wrong with the hotel itself was that it could have used some interior renovations, particularly hallway carpeting. The room itself was clean but did have a small odor of cigarette. It was a non smoking room, so I can only blame the previous occupants of the room for the smell. A can of
Febreze from the dollar store just down the street fixed the problem. Only other problem was inconsiderate guests not respecting their neighbors when moving up and down the hallway at night. But I find that this is a problem in every hotel no matter how many stars it has.

I left Las Vegas the following Sunday and a check out was a breeze, trip to the Airport was less than 15 minutes, but it was 5:00 AM in the morning. And yes I left my car in Vegas with a friend.</p><br>Worst experience in History, poorest level of service ever experienced.<p>Upon arrival the Front Desk clerk greeted us by saying the computers were down so she could not verify my reservation. I offered her our confirmation number and the confirmation email confirming our stay. The agent said no and there's nothing she can do. I called customer service and they promptly faxed our reservation details to the hotel. It was 4 am by the time we were checked in. The manager began calling the room at 9:00 AM staying there was a problem with my card. The problem was that they incorrectly charged me over $600 for a one night stay! The next morning around 11:45, we awoke to 2 police officers banging on the door saying the front desk called because checkout time was 11:00 am and we were refusing to leave! Unheard of! The treatment rendered by every staff member we came into contact with could not be classified as service. Additionally the condition of the facility should not be considered clean, maintained or accommodating. Worst stay ever.. True Story. What a disgrace for the Extended Stay Corporation to be represented by this location. The most concerning part is as I'm reading reviews for this hotel, my experience is not unique, apparently calling the police on guest (unwarranted) is a common business practice for this location.</p><br>Bad smell in room<p>I recently stood here for a few hours while waiting for my flight i got a room with 2 beds 1 of them smelled like tobacco, the bathroom was tiny and had stains all over the tub and toilet. Also while walking the property there was a large group of men drinking and smoking weed bbqing in the parking lot it was a little uncomfortable since this was suppose to be a family place</p><br>Worst hotel experience<p>My husband and I checked in the hotel Labor Day weekend. The man who checked us in was kind and attentive. However, when we went to our room we discovered the room was filthy. There was dog food on the floor among other trash. We went straight back to front desk and reported this issue and was informed that apparently the room had not been cleaned yet. Mind you..we checked it around 9pm. How can the room not be clean yet?

We were assigned to another room on the second level and again was disappointed because this time the room smelled of cigarettes when we clearly requested non-smoking room.

The worst part of our one night stay was that at 7 AM a rude employee banged on our door. My husband sleepily answered and she loudly told us that we "are not suppose to be here" and she began questioning him regarding our reservation and rudely said she would check with the main reception. She did not come back to explain or apologize. I was absolutely appalled that this happened.

Terrible service and experience even for a budget hotel.</p><br>Awesome experience &amp; service!!<p>A great hotel! All the ammenities you need! A good location, not too far from the strip! But most of all the receptionist, Joleen, was outstanding! She made my checki-in and my stay an awesome experience. She was very understanding to my need to book this reservation quick, no rush to check-in and great customer service! & A great place for families.</p><br>Nice stay<p>Stayed here for a week, hotel needs some cosmetic upgrades for sure, but convenient to have amenities such as stove top, and full fridge. Pool is not big but clean, and cool for hot days. Friendly staff. Free wi-fi. Just a short drive to the strip. Some great chain restaurants close by -Applebees, IHOP, etc
Room Tip: We started off on the 3rd floor and a long walk to the end of the hall to our room...6 months pregna...
See more room tips</p><br>terrible service!!<p>stayed here in late July 2014. rooms are bad for an Extended Stay - No coffee pot, shoddy bathrooms. Service was AWFUL. I had a late night in Vegas and at 6am asked for a late checkout (noon), the woman barely spoke English but seemed to understand. I was woken up three times before then, once told by the front desk they "didn't do late check outs." then as I was booking a flight, the maids knocked on by door three times between noon and 12:10 before being told I was going to be charged for another night and the cops were being called. Completely unprofessional and discourteous staff. Avoid at all costs!!!!</p><br>average/slightly below<p>The accommodations were somewhat satisfactory, very roomy for the price (we got a two bedroom suite for under $80/night for memorial day weekend). They do not have housekeeping services included, its extra per night. We did not spend too much time in the room so this was not an issue for us. The pool and hot tub were sufficient. Towards the end of our stay we found a few ant-type bugs in the room, one of which was on our bed and immediately turned me off to never want to stay here again. It was ok for the price, I expected sub-par accommodations, but I would not stay there again. Also, the breakfast was coffee and granola bars, they do not refill when it empties. Unfortunate for necessary caffeine addicts.</p><br></body></html>
