<html><head><h3>Fairfield Inn Las Vegas Airport Hotel Reviews Page 24</h3></head><body><br>If Just Passing Through: STAY HERE<p>We were on a canyons tour (which was spectacular by-the-way, and stayed here only one night for an easy trip to the airport. It was great. Comfortable, quiet room with a mini fridge and a micro, easy courteous check-in, and the usual breakfast bar. The bed was very comfortable. Best of all they have a shuttle, and they picked us up at the airport after we returned the rental car and delivered us back in the morning. Also, within easy walking distance were many nice restaurants. We avoided all the crazyiness of the strip - but it's not far away if that's what you're into.</p><br>Clean, nice lobby &amp; breakfast, great staff, but very tiny rooms!<p>Hotel was clean with a nice and helpful staff. We had to check out of South Point Hotel Casino & Spa for two days during our trip due to them being booked solid, so we chose this Fairfield Inn. I may just be spoiled by the rooms/facility at South Point, but I was pretty disappointed when we came here. The rooms with double beds were very small. The double beds almost seemed as though they were twin beds. The bathroom was very tiny too. There were only one set of elevators that at one point only one was working. I would pay a bit more money to stay somewhere else. The lobby and the breakfast was also nice.</p><br>Short stop-over<p>Pre-booked this as we needed a stop-over on the way to California. The hotel was easy to find and had good parking, it is about a mile from the strip and in the temperatures here walking is out, so we were pleased to discover that the hotel has a free shuttle. The shuttle runs on demand to and from the strip, just ring them when you need to return. It runs until 11pm after that a taxi costs abut $9 from the strip.
The hotel did NOT inform us about the shuttle on check in, it was only when I asked what was the best way to the strip that I was told about it! Also on the website it says the hotel has a laundry IT DOES NOT you can however use the laundry in the adjacent Mariott free of charge. The pool was small but OK and the brekfast was also typicall of Mariott, nice clean place to stay. Baham Breeze within walking distance</p><br>Even at 5:30 a.m., we were greeted with a smile<p>We came to Vegas for a basketball tournament with a team of teenage boys and their families. This was the perfect location, as it was just a short drive to show the kids the lights on the Vegas strip at night. To avoid a lot of the Vegas "riff-raff', I recommend a visit to the Circus Circus amusement park and their all-you-can-eat buffet for the kids...they loved it, and didnt have to see all the more "adult-oriented" Vegas sights. Coming back to the Fairfield was comforting as we were always welcomed back with a friendly "hello" by the front desk staff. The rooms were very clean and had just what we needed..nothing fancy. There was always coffee available, and the "egg-sandwiches" and freshly made waffles were a hit with the boys. Early in the mornings another Mom and myself would head out at 5:30 a.m. for a brisk one hour walk to the Strip and back, and we were always greeted with a "Good Morning!!!" and a smile by the front desk staff. I would definitely return!</p><br>Perfect if you don't need the Strip buzz<p>We have stayed in Vegas on previous occasions. To be in the centre of things and soak up the whole "Vegas Experience" we recommend staying in one of the large Strip hotels. However, this time we were flying in and leaving next morning for Southern Utah. This was a perfect hotel for us - a few minutes from the Airport car rental place. Large and very clean bedroom and bathroom, comfortable bed, perfectly adequate continental breakfast and efficient desk staff when checking in and out.</p><br>very clean<p>us air had to pay for us a room so they sent us to fairfield inn.i was surprised at how clean this motel was.we were way off the strip. we went to mcdonalds for burgers. the 7-11 for beer.back to the room to (veggie out)watch tv.next thim we come to vegas we will stay here and rent a car.the staff was great but they need to remember everyone dont drink coffee so turn on the juice mach.</p><br>Great Staff and Nice Stay<p>We stayed only one night as I had a free night on Marriott Rewards. The free shuttle from the airport was perfect and the driver was really accomodating. After checking in, he took us to the Strip for free. The front desk was quick on chekc in and gave us free bottled waters. Great service. The next day they called a cab for us when checking out, a very short wait. Their location is not too bad, there are a couple of smaller casinos close by and restaurants.</p><br>Friendly Front Desk<p>It was a nice clean hotel with absolutely friendly front desk and hotel personnel. This is one of the few Fairfield Inns that I stayed at that I can really rave about the friendliness of all of the personnel. The only two problems I saw are the water from the sink and bathtub drained very slowly in my room, and the guest computers down in the lobby area had problems loading up files, so one would sit waiting a few minutes for each display to come up.</p><br>Nice stay off of the strip<p>This hotel was off the strip, on Paradise Road, and the traffic was much easier to negotiate. We stayed only one night. The hotel and room were very clean and comfortable. The ladies at the front desk were very helpful, and answered all our questions and concerns. Breakfast was good, and it was nice to have some meat items in addition to pastries, etc. We didn't get to use the fitness room, but it was filled with many aerobic machines - treatmills, bikes, etc. The only thing that I noticed that I didn't like was that the jets in the outdoor hottub were not very forceful, and the tub was shallow. Those are small complaints. The stay was nice, and we would stay again at this Fairfield.</p><br>Loved staying at Fairfield Inn Las Vegas Airport<p>Stayed at hotel during EMS Expo convention for five days from Duke University Medical Center. Staff was very friendly at desk and always said hello when passing the front desk. Housekeeping staff done an outstanding job in making sure the room was neat and cleaned. The older gentlemen who shuttle me to the convention center and airport was very friendly. He made me feel welcome in Las Vegas. I would stay there again if visiting Las Vegas again.</p><br></body></html>
