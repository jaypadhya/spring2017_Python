<html><head><h3>Fairfield Inn Las Vegas Airport Hotel Reviews Page 19</h3></head><body><br>Great stay<p>I stay there several times a month; the s staff is attentIve and friendly. The rooms are clean and the shuttle prompt. There are many great food locations nearby (good, as there is no restaurant on site although they do have a nice breakfast in e morning) and it is a 15 min walk from the strip if you are so inclined. It's a great deal for an off strip hotel.</p><br>nice stay, manager terrific<p>We were here for a two day conference stay. Had a couple of problems blowing a fuse and a door that wouldn't close. Night staff wasn't as accommodating, bit the manager Stormi, was absolutely terrific. She took care of the problems immediately, and even offered a rate adjustment. We will return. Thanks.</p><br>Good off strip business hotel<p>The hotel location is great for business. Out of the noise and bustle but close enough to the action if desired.
To start, the hotel staff are fantastic, friendly, informed and helpful. Front desk, shuttle drivers and cleaning staff are very nice. The breakfast is quite good and the rooms are clean and quiet.
The hotel seems to mirror the situation of the US economy. As jobs get tight, workers tend to hold give superior service but capital is scarce so I was told a planned renovation planned for this year was cancelled. Shame as the hotel needs it, with some rooms looking worn and tired. My air conditioner didn't work, in the gym one treadmill was out of order and the eliptical was in bad need of adjustment, my bath tub wouldn't drain for example.
In all, location and staff save this hotel but they really a reno and to step up the upkeep.</p><br>The Worst Mariott Hotel in the world!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<p>I made my reservations at this hotel and then thought better in the Cosmopolitan, but later note that the cancellation charged me one night and it was then speak again to this hotel and ask for the restoration of my reservation and there was supposedly no problem , and arrived the day and take my room and headed to the bathroom and when I travel around the shower curtains first thing that fell was a dirty and smelly rag!!.
And I ask that the exhaust air of the toilet was not working and the reception clerk answered me is working just fine but without sound. And finally, almost a month later I see that in my statement from my credit card charged me twice and you have a month that this happened and neither the Marriot hotel or customer service have solved anything.</p><br>Excellent!!!!!!!<p>The fairfield Inn Las Vegas Airport was a very calming Hotel.It was very close to the strip.The breakfast was very nice.I love this hotel!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p><br>Great Stay<p>What the hotel lacked in location they made up for in service. I had an issue with my shower and the front desk staff was able to move me to a room where I would be more comfortable. The shuttle service staff were equally as friendly and accomadating. All in all I was satisfied with my stay.</p><br>Great location, nice place to stay<p>Fairfield, Las Vegas had comfy beds, good breakfast, and helpful staff. They gave good dinner recommendations. The only problem was a very slow drain in the shower.</p><br>For a Marriott Property I was disappointed!<p>The hotel was dirty, Unfortunately I had to venture behind the night stand to plug in an appliance. Behind the stand I found several disgusting things, there were several very large clipped toenails greeting me along with moldy food and wrappers. This really was very upsetting and disgusting. The plug was broken and was an electrical hazard as well. The furniture was very well used. Also the rooms air conditioner blew on the bed closest to the unit and made it very uncomfortable. We also were upset about some conflicting information from the desk clerk. We had requested a late check out 4PM on Sunday, the clerk quoted us $29.00. Come the day of checkout we went to the desk and were charged $39.00 as I reviewed my. I disputed charge and was told the I had been misinformed by the night clerk and that the $29.00 was for checking out at 2PM. I asked for a refund and the clerk stated that she would bring it up to the manager for action. Have not heard a work or my $10.00 refund since! No laundry facilities. Hotel is in a odd area, but ther are lots of restaurants within walking distance. Bathroom sink area very small.
Room Tip: No laundry facilities at this location for thise traveling with sports teams. Room refrigerator has...

The shuttle staff are equally friendly. This hotel has an exceptional shuttle service in a city that is generally deficient in shuttles. The shuttle takes people to the airport and to the Strip. .

When we first opened the door of our room we saw a very ugly closet. Apart from the ugly closet however the room was quite nice and it had everything we needed.

I left at 4 am and was given a nice breakfast for $3. Overall I was very pleased with this hotel and would stay there again. I particularly appreciated the shuttle service, the free coffee in the lobby, frig in the room, and access to microwaves in the breakfast room.</p><br>Least favorite place to stay in Vegas<p>I'm sure there are worse places to stay in Vegas, I have just not stayed in them. This hotel does not have quiet rooms, I heard planes flying by all night, if you stay here be sure to bring a white noise machine.
The morning breakfast leaves much to be desired in that what they offer isn't much.
Worst of all is that the staff doesn't really try to accommodate guest requests. I was there with a large group that was there for a debate tournament, people there for the tournament were occupying about 80% of the rooms and the hotel was completely booked. We all had to be over at the tournament at 8 AM in the morning which meant that everyone there for the tournament had to leave by 7:30, the breakfast buffet didn't open until 7 AM. A request was made to see if it was possible to get it opened sooner. The answer was no. So come 7 AM it was crazy in there and the lady who was supposed to get the juice machine working was no where to be found. I tried asking at the front desk and they had no idea what to do since they couldn't see the one and only employee that could evidently do anything about problems with the breakfast buffet. If you have 250 people trying to hit this buffet all at the same time one person can not handle it.</p><br></body></html>
