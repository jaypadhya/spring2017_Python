<html><head><h3>Fairfield Inn Las Vegas Airport Hotel Reviews Page 11</h3></head><body><br>Good<p>It is a good place to stay. Just a normal hotel room. Good quality of service and transfer to the airport. Good pool and good breakfast. People at the desk are very kind and gentle. Close to the airport.</p><br>fairfield inn las vegas paradise road<p>After calling front desk and telling them of a late arrival and not to give the room away, I was shocked when I arrived the only room they had left was the handicapped room on the first floor.
If one more person would have checked in before me they would have to put me up at an alternative hotel. Upon entering the room the air conditioner was not working properly, (blowing out hot air) nothing the front desk could do to fix it. Breakfast is a great perk at this Fairfield Inn and the complimentary shuttle to the strip is great but I wish the shuttle would drop off at multiple locations, shuttle only goes back and forth to the Wynn the casino located at the end of the strip.

I would recommend this Fairfield Inn as a in between stop between strip hotels.</p><br>Excellent Stay!<p>Landed at 130am early Sunday morning and was looking forward to a comfortable bed. I was delighted to see the place was fully renovated since my stay there last summer. I flew back home on Monday evening. Though my stay lasted only 43 hours, the time I spent at the Fairfield Inn over breakfasts, the pool, and my bed, I felt as if I had been relaxed on vacation for a week! Love this place. Stormi, Hillary, the rest of the staff, including the shuttle drivers, go above and beyond to help make your stay the best it can be. Would absolutely stay the next time I am in Vegas..</p><br>Business Trip<p>Stormi the GM was gracious and professional. Her staff are attentive and courteous. Thank you KT and Mya for all your assistance. I recommend this hotel. Thank you all again. You went out of your way to accommodate my needs, thank you.
Room Tip: If you like a king size bed make a reservation on the 4th floor with an odd number room. These are...

Hotel itself was extremely noisy. Teenagers running up and down the halls all night. Had to call security twice. Doors slam LOUDLY. Manager was attentive and responded quickly but noise didn't stop. Won't stay again.</p><br>Fairfield Inn and Suites Marriott Las Vegas Airport<p>This hotel is a hidden jewel. Approx 5 miles from the airport, close to strip and the best Tapas I have ever eaten at Firefly Tapas right next door. This will be my hotel of choice whether on business or pleasure. I stay at a lot of Fairfield Inn and Suites and the breakfast served at this facility was one of the best for presentation and freshness.
Room Tip: If you are just looking to hang out on Las Vegas strip, stay at this hotel and don't rent a car.

I'm fussy about bedding and towels and don't tolerate lint on them. Towels and sheets were lint free, smelled and felt fresh. We didn't see anything that wasn't perfectly spotless clean. Very comfortable place to stay. Beds were very comfortable. Staff was friendly and helpful, even at 2 am when we checked in. Great breakfast.</p><br>Book this hotel!!<p>This hotel exemplifies customer service. I stayed 5 nights here while at a convention at LVCC and I could not have been more impressed!! The hotel has exceedingly friendly and professional staff, newly renovated rooms, quality exercise equipment and a great view of the mountains! It is very clean, very quiet (I was on the 2nd floor), is all nonsmoking, and is about a mile from the strip, and about a mile from LVCC. It does not charge a resort fee, and still offers free wifi, free shuttle, free breakfast and free boarding pass printing: a great value. There are several restaurants in the neighboring shopping center. In the wackiness of a city like Vegas, this hotel is a breath of fresh air!</p><br>An oasis in a mess called Las Vegas<p>It's a bit away from the Strip - clean, quiet, comfortable and reasonable. Everything's fresh and up-to-date without being glitzy or pretentious, in other words, handsomely spartan. This was our first overnight stay in Las Vegas, returning from a week in Utah's national parks, and our impression of the Strip is that it's a dump.
Room Tip: The desk clerks here are kids who don't know much about town attractions, so ask for the visito...

For little more than the price of parking I get a comfortable bed and a safe place to leave my car. I took the 430am shuttle arriving at the airport in about 10-12 minutes. One issue with the room was a slow drain in the bathtub. Front Desk was very helpful and said it would be addressed.</p><br></body></html>
