<html><head><h3>Fairfield Inn Las Vegas Airport Hotel Reviews Page 4</h3></head><body><br>Poor Service<p>We missed our flight connection so the airline booked us here for the night. We didn't arrive until about 9:00 p.m., very tired with 2 kids, under 3 years old. When we checked in we asked if they had any cribs or pack n' plays for our kids to sleep in. We were told by the lady at the desk that she was the only one working at the desk and we would just have to wait until she could check on it. Granted, we know it was busy, but her attitude was more like she was annoyed that she actually had to work. She did call about 45 minutes later only to tell us they didn't have any cribs or pack n' plays available. This is supposed to be a large hotel chain and no cribs or pack n plays?? Also was not impressed with the shuttle service. We arrived with 4 large bags and 2 carseats, a stroller and 2 little kids. The shuttle driver basically just pushed our stuff out the back end of the van and left it all there in a big pile right in the middle of the road. Didn't even offer to move it to the sidewalk or offer to get a luggage cart to put it on. My husband had to hurry and run in the hotel and get the luggage cart himself. And, yes, we did tip him.

Just not impressed at all. Yes, we get it. We have whiny tired kids but we are still paying customers. We weren't in Vegas to party and have fun like most people so I guess we deserve less than good service? The only good part of the stay was the breakfast was above average.</p><br>Mixed Emotions?<p>The staff, the shuttle, the breakfast all were excellent, the room was clean and comfortable. I had no problems at all, the facility just does not shine like most Marriotts like I'm use too?

If you stay you will be OK but it must be due for a refresh?</p><br>Unexpected stay<p>We were stuck unexpectedly overnight in Vegas. We did not get to the hotel until almost 3am. The front staff was very nice and helpful with quickly getting or room keys, as well as a crib for our 4 month old.</p><br>Shockingly Poor for A Marriott<p>Thank heavens for a sharp desk clerk (Christina)! We booked 24 hours ago driving from Boise to Phoenix with a Vegas stop over. Dumb us to only book 24 hours in advance on a Saturday night in Vegas but as Silver (Gold previous years)Marriott Rewards members we quickly secured this hotel for tonight. Arriving at 6:30 the lobby feels a little Motel Sixish but the shock came with the rooms. We first were given 315 which when the bathroom light was flipped on revealed paint cans and wallboard mud. Yup they had been repairing the ceiling and left the goods to prove it. Perhaps we could have lived with that but why at $159 a night (and they wouldn't give us the AAA discount "sold out" they said). When the air conditioning unit wouldn't cool we said enough and headed back downstairs. A great clerk Christina apologized and gave us 227. Guess what:? When the lock clicked the door revealed a room with a knocked over garbage can (plastic after all this is Marriott's cheap brand) and beds with nothing on them but wadded up mattress mads. No sheets, no pillows. Obviously this room was unfinished by the made. So why did the front desk have it as available inventory?
The third time was the charm. Again Christina apologized reduced the rate for our hassle to $99 and threw in some bonus points. We stayed in 225 next door which was fine.
Odd that a Marriott would have this kind of trouble. The walls in the halls are beat up and the popcorn ceiling makes you feel like your down the street at the old Las Vegas Hilton now called LVH or some such. Stay away from this Marriott property? Will we be at a Marriott again? Yes but doubtful a Fairfield. Last week we had 4 nights in Hiltons competition to this price range and it was much, much better.</p><br>Great location and great price <p>The room was very comfortable, the bathroom is spacious. You can have access to the pool where towels are provided
You also have access to the gym at every time of the day or the night.
In the morning the free breakfast is great, you have a large choice.
5 minutes away from the Strip by car and free parking (you can park for free at the hotel and also on the Strip)
For sure I'll pick this hotel for my future trip in Las Vegas .</p><br>Good stay in las<p>Clean friendly hotel, free breakfast no bugs, clean pool. Lots of restaurants to walk to. Staff was outstanding, hotel smelled fresh. Would come here and stay again, and suggest to other staying in in area</p><br>Great staff, tired rooms<p>Stayed here as a Park & fly, the hotel was clean but the rooms are old and their market is tiny. When I got back from my trip, my battery was dead. The front desk clerk was kind enough to loan me her jumper cables and jump my car, even though it was nearly midnight and miserable outside. Great hotel if you're just here for the night, but I'd spring for something a little nicer if it was a vacation hotel.</p><br>Car broken into with camara's and security on site "Really"<p>Our 2015 Subaru was broken into at Marriott in Las Vegas June 21, 2015 shame on us for leaving items in the car. When we checked in we asked about security. We were told there were camera’s and a security guard on site. We had a reasonable expectation we should be okay. We feel this was an inside job by the security company. The car had the back window and two side windows smashed, a lot of glass. There was enough stuff since we had just been on a biking and camping trip in the North Rim of the Grand Canyon. A truck had to hull the amount of items off. All night long the security didn’t see the broken Glass???

The ladies at the front desk went above and beyond to get the car cleaned up and file a police report and incident report to Marriott. THE KICKER we received a form letter from Marriott insurance Hanover stating they take no responsibility “too bad”. Please stay with us again. Really!!!! “Shame on you Marriott”</p><br>Perfect hotel for a convention<p>SO the Fairfield Inn is just a perfect place to stay for a convention. Ideally situated just a mile down Paradise Road from the convention center, their shuttle will not only pick you up at the airport but will take you to your conference as well. Perfect and convenient. Rooms are clean and comfortable, and best of all Marriott does not charge a resort fee or for wi-fi. Free breakfast also included with your stay. There also is no casino and no smoking at this hotel, so it's a great choice for families as well. Fairfield Inn Las Vegas is a great place to stay.</p><br>Great people!<p>Sometimes when you stay at a hotel one of the people at the check in is very nice - not here - they all were awesome! Also, is was not just one day either. All shifts every day the staff was super. The location was nice as well and the shuttle drivers were pleasant and on time. Overall this was a great experience and I would recommend this hotel to anyone.</p><br></body></html>
