<html><head><h3>Fairfield Inn Las Vegas Airport Hotel Reviews Page 17</h3></head><body><br>Ok Hotel off the strip<p>I've stayed here once with work. Located behind the Wynn area The free breakfast was nice The rooms are very standard and nothing special. The bathrooms we found to be smaller but ok. I've stayed at nicer hotels off the strip and if I was coming for vacation on my own, I wouldn't stay here. The staff was very nice.</p><br>An Average hotel with wonderful staff<p>I stayed in this hotel last year for 3 days. I was travelling from chicago to vegas. Being a marriott platinum member, i chose this hotel as i had enough points to pay for this stay all by points. Worst thing that I found here was there bus service which is alsmost of no use. It is not at walking distance from strip, so we definitely need a ride either vy cab or shuttle service of hotel but shuttle service was full waste. We waited for more than an hour at airport for pickup. Then while coming back from the strip, after waiting for 40 minutes we finally took a cab.
Rooms are just OK but for anyfault in the room, staff members feel so sorry that we just can't say anything. They are always ready to accept their mistakes and to give us marriott points for anything that is not perfect.</p><br>Perfect for my convention center visit<p>I was in Vegas for a trade show at the convention center and usually stay at a casino hotel. I wanted a quieter experience and this was perfect. Upon my arrival to the airport, I called the hotel and they promptly sent the (FREE) shuttle to pick me up. When I walked in the door the receptionist greeted me by my name and I was checked into my room within 45 minutes of touchdown. The last time I was in Vegas it was at least a 2 hour ordeal after waiting in line for a cab, paying a cab fee, waiting in a long line at the casino hotel, and walking the length of the hotel to my room where I paid $15/day for internet service. The room was clean and completely met my needs with good tv and free internet access. This will be my Vegas home in the future.</p><br>Clean place, no frills, but nice...................<p>This Fairfield Inn was just a mile or so away from the strip. The breakfast was free, rooms were big enough and it was a fairly quiet part of town. Needless to say, it's not a glitzy place, no casino, no extras but the price was great for Vegas!</p><br>Ok for a short stay<p>We stayed here for just a night. Hotel was clean although it is showing its age. The heat/ac located near bed was noisy (as they usually are). Toilet had a slow leak inside tank so it would refill about once an hour. Staff was told about problem but they seemed to dismiss it. Door to room would only close if pushed/pulled pretty hard (again staff seemed to dismiss this when I told them of it). Breakfast area was clean and well stocked when we arrived early. Only complaint is they didn't have bread. I have never been to a hotel where they didn't have bread!
If you are a light sleeper you may wish to choose another as planes go over very regularly.</p><br>All the charm of a cinder-block storage unit (in a convenient location)<p>We stayed at the Fairfield Inn Las Vegas Airport for almost a week while attending the Consumer Electronics Show in January 2013. During CES, taxis are extremely hard to snag because there are 150,000 other people trying to get from their hotels to the show in the morning, or back to their hotels in the evening, or to restaurants for dinner. It's not unusual to have a 30- to 45-minute wait for a cab at prime time, so we picked this hotel so that we could walk to and from the show every day. It worked well for that. Other hotels within walking distance of the LVCC were very expensive ($500 and up per night) so even at $200, it was still sort of a bargain.

However, the hotel itself was completely average in all respects. It was fairly clean and wasn't smoky unlike most larger Vegas hotels, but the property shows definite signs of aging and deferred maintenance. Our room was furnished with tired institutional furniture, lacked a safe for our valuables, had a tiny wardrobe instead of a closet, and the hotel's free breakfast was something you'd probably reject at a Denny's.

There's nothing "fun" about this hotel. The only thing it offers that is hard to get in Vegas is its proximity to the convention center. It's on a very busy, dirty street a few blocks back from the Strip, so if nightlife is your goal, this isn't the place to be. We actually felt a bit uncomfortable walking outside the hotel at night. It's not a bad neighborhood but "grubby" comes to mind.

To end on a positive note, the hotel is one of the few in Vegas that offers a free shuttle to and from the airport, and the breakfast staff and front desk staff were very friendly and helpful.

I guess the bottom line for me was that I didn't spend hours in taxi lines, and my hair and clothes didn't get all smoky smelling. Next year at CES, I might even go back, but I won't expect anything except a place to sleep at night and a cheap breakfast.
Room Tip: Unless you're an extremely sound sleeper, avoid rooms on the south side of the hotel. The trash...

The breakfast buffet was a horrible experience - my folks are both handicapped, the breakfast area was not handicapped accessible, their was hardly any food at 8:30 in the a.m. The place was a madhouse - guests were grabbing what they could to eat, the staff was slowly replenishing the food, not enough places to sit and eat. Front desk staff was very nice and friendly.</p><br>Way above average!<p>I stayed here only one night - wish it had been more. The location is convenient to the airport, without the annoying resort fee. The room was modern and well kept, staff very friendly and efficient, and the free Wifi worked well. Breakfast was excellent - fresh fruit, yogurt and fruit cups, hot breakfast sandwiches, make your own waffles, cereal, juice - you could set yourself up for the day here! I got a great deal on Priceline, but would consider it a good value at regular prices. You would look a long time for a better deal at this level of property.</p><br>A GREAT value!<p>I checked in at this hotel on Jan 31 2012. I appreciated the welcoming friendly staff. The room was very nice. The carpeting was spotless, the bathroom was clean, the furniture in excellent condition. A comfortable bed, a mini-frig and a large flat panel TV made for a great stay! The complimentary breakfast was surprisingly extensive and included fresh Belgian Waffles, bagels, cereal, fruit, juice and hard boiled eggs, etc. The coffee was fresh and hot. Everything was fresh and frequently replenished by a friendly welcoming staff. This is a great place to stay and the value for the price is excellent. I highly recommend this Fairfield!!</p><br>Definitely worth the stay<p>We stayed after an 11 hour flight in from London, and just wanted some peace and quiet to sleep away the jet lag. The check in staff was efficient and we got to our room quickly. A typical Fairfield room, yes, but the bed was great. The next morning, the complimentary breakfast was more than satisfying with fresh waffles, breakfast sandwiches, and the usual continental assortment. If you are looking for a central location not on the strip and without gaming, this could meet your needs.</p><br></body></html>
