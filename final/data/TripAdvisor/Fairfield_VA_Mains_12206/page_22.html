<html><head><h3>Fairfield Inn Las Vegas Airport Hotel Reviews Page 22</h3></head><body><br>If you need an internet connection, don't stay here<p>My wife and I recently stayed here. The hotel is on pa rwith other Fairfield Inn's we have stayed at: JFK Airport in New York, Newark Airport, and in Scottsdale Arizona. However, internet use left much to be desired. We were unable to connect to the internet from our room as advertised, and was advised by the front desk to call technical support but received a message to leave my name and other details for a call-back. At the front desk it was suggested that I take my lap-top computer to the Starbucks about a 5 minute walk in the July desert heat and to buy a cup of coffee for use of their internet connection. I might add that in the evening of our 1 night stay, the two hotel computers near the dining room were unable to surf the internet.
The following day the front desk was able to connect me to technical support and I was then able to surf the net on my lap-top computer but only in the lobby. I was given a typed letter at the front desk written by the manager apologizing for problems with the internet connections due to an upgrading of the system at the hotel. If this was true, why was a card promoting fast and efficient room connections to the internet left in the room? As the manager of the hotel was not available at the time, I left a feed-back card for her explaining the problem. I was told that she would reply to my evaluation as guest satisfaction was very important to the hotel. In addition, I was told that I would probably be compensated for my inconvenience via a price adjustment or Marriott Points.
Two weeks have passed and I have not been notified by any hotel representative.</p><br>Skip this dump...NOT Marriott standards.<p>I always, always stay at Marriott properties, but his is one hotel which shouldn't carry the Marriott name. The place is dirty, wi-fi doesn't work and the manager I delt with Kaena was less than friennly or helpful! Spend your money elsewhere! I would never stay here again, I was misled by some of the positive reviews I read....! If you have standards on where you like to sleep at night and are a true Rewards Member, skip this dump! I ended up cancelling my reservation and moving to another Marriott property clsoer to the strip.</p><br>Not recommended if you want to be near the Strip - where the action is<p>Service is average, no fuss. The female staff at the reception don't smile at all. They seem to be in a hurry serving you or when talking to you. The male receptionist at night is friendlier and nicer. The driver for the shuttle is nice and helpful.
The room is clean and has enough space. No bed bugs at all. Free internet plug-in in the room, free internet at the lobby area, free breakfast (however, you have to be up before 10am, or else, you won't be served enough), free shuttle service to/from the hotel-airport, to/from hotel-The Strip area drop off/pick-up (O Sheas and Wynn). They have a pool, and a gym. It's inexpensive, and you get a lot of plusses. It has its advantages and disadvantages.
However, I don't recommend this to people who want to go to the Strip everyday. Yo will end up waiting for the shuttle. Good if the shuttle is available - they only have 1 (one) shuttle service. There were about 5x we were not able to use their shuttle because: it's still at the airport picking-up a guest, or the tire broke down, or it won't be back soon. It happened to us. So don't depend on their free shuttle always. Be ready to spend for a cab ride. Overall, you will have to weigh it. But if I were to come back to Vegas, I will try The Venetian/Palazzo or Wynn (but these are more expensive) since they are near the Strip and has shops and theaters available.
Room Tip: The 4th floor rooms are Non-smoking, which I appreciate a lot.

It's a franchise marriott that needs management help. We were just there for basketball tourney so a bunch teenagers not harshest critics ..Housekeeping is mess just not enough staff /supervision .Don't expect anything on stayovers (no new shamppoo/ the bed being remade ,poor girls are way over worked .Breakfast always ranout stuff because staffing poor desk clerks had to also run over and cover .One of our group found used condom laying in open called housekeeping and GM everyone apologized and susposely cleaned second time he looked under bed and found 4 more ! Yuck! We all no housekeeping is toughest job in world "bless them" but really this bad ..

The free shuttle was a definite plus, as we were returning our rental car and wouldn't have transportation. We were able to catch the van back from the airport, and rode to the hotel with an airline employee. Seems a lot of them use this hotel to stay over. We did notice that there is no set schedule for the shuttle, as the driver has to pick up/drop off at the airport, as well as the stops on the strip. Our driver was kind enough to drop a group at the convention center, even though it wasn't an official stop. The hotel room was clean and beds comfortable, although there seems to be an issue with the water pressure. We found the breakfast to be adequate in quantity and quality, although there was not enough seating. We were pleased with our choice, which was dictated by budget. We took the monorail downtown, a short walk from the hotel. I would recommend this hotel to others who don't care about staying on the strip.</p><br>FLEABAG HOTEL. HORRIBLE LOCATION. RUDE STAFF. RAT INFESTED<p>Horrible staff. Dirty hotel. Horrible location. Never again.</p><br>Out of expectation shuttle bus service and breakfast<p>It is late when we arrive on the New Year day to check in. The best thing is that it has shuffle bus for you to call in the airport to pick you up. You can use the phone hanging on the wall. If you donâ€™t know just ask the airport staff. There is not a definite schedule. It is a custom service but the bus is constantly picking up its customers. Be sure to let the hotel know that which terminal you are. The next morning we ask the route of the bus and find that there are 4 stopovers that you can be dropped off. As we are going to Venetian and it is not one of the drop off point, the operator is kind enough to drive us there as we are the only ones on the bus. Of course, gratuity is highly recommended. Try not to walk to the Strip as it is quite far, my estimate is about 20 to 25 minutes with nothing in between.

The Front Desk is kind. We check in the top floor. It is a standard Fairfield Inn. The good thing is that at the lobby, it has a self serve tea/coffee 24 hours with milk/lemon. There is a shelf with snacks that you can buy. The Front Desk is responsible for cleaning up the self serve table as well as refilling coffee and hot water. How busy can they be!

In the morning the breakfast is included. It has boiled egg, Danish, Croissant, bread and bagel that you can toast, juice. One should not miss the self help freshly baked waffles. It has full instructions on the side. Almost everyone having breakfast will not miss that.

I didn't use the swimming pool but the look out of my window doesn't seem that it is very clean</p><br>As a no-frills functional stopover, this is fine, especially with free shuttle<p>It's effectively a 2 star motel but if all you need is to sleep here then it's a great option. Free internet PC's in the lobby and free wired access in the rooms. Don't have high expectations of the inclusive breakfast - basically cereals and bagels - but unlimited tea and good coffee make it fit for purpose. Helpful friendly staff. It's about 20 minutes' walk to the Strip BUT, BIG 'PLUS' - free shuttle will get you to/from key locations on the Strip and the airport - just ask and it appears. The fact that the hotel is off-strip keeps the price down and the shuttle solves the location issue so it's a good compromise if needed. Popular casual eatery next door if you don't want to venture that far. Even has a pool open in summer months.</p><br>Predictable Fairfield Inn, for better or worse<p>We stayed at the Fairfield Inn on our way back from Europe. Decent room, typical American breakfast (sugar cereal, waffles, packaged rolls). I think it's identical to every other Fairfield in the US, which means decent, but totally devoid of personality. The best part of the stay: eating at the Firefly next door. Outstanding tapas and a lively atmosphere. The Fairfield gets five stars on location for being next door!</p><br>Nice overnight stay - hotel offered many extras<p>I stayed at the Fairfield Inn for just one night and had an excellent stay. The room was clean, the Internet was included and the A/C easily managed the mid-August Vegas heat. Unlike many Vegas properties nowadays, the Fairfield has no resort fees! The breakfast was nice and a step up from "continental" style. There were waffles, breakfast sandwiches and mini-quiches alongside the fruit, cereal and pastries. It's the only hotel in Las Vegas I know of that has a free shuttle from the airport so no $$$ dealings with unscrupulous cabbies. Their shuttle will also take you to the convention center or the strip (Wynn's or O'Shea's/Harrah's). When you're ready to return to your room, just call them and the shuttle driver will pick you up in 10 minutes.

The front desk staff was a friendly bunch who gave good advice on local restaurants and attractions. Last, but certainly not least, the price was very fair.

I would stay here again without hesitation.</p><br></body></html>
