<html><head><h3>Fairfield Inn Las Vegas Airport Hotel Reviews Page 14</h3></head><body><br>Great Choice for the weekend<p>My son and I flew to Vegas to see Dane Cook at the Venetian. Rooms on the strip over the weekend are EXPENSIVE. Didn't want to pay $359 a night at the Venetian so looked off the strip (didn't find any strip hotel on that side of the strip for less than $200). Found this place for$109 and was not expecting much. I was pleasantly surprised....free shuttle from the airport and will also drop you off at the Wynn on the strip. The rooms were clean and newly remodeled. Rooms and hallways had that new carpet smell. Lay out and storage in room very nice, even had a fridge and microwave. Free internet. Staff went out of their way to be helpful. Free breakfast had a wide array of choices. For the money this place can not be beat. Also had a small outdoor pool that we did not use. Delivery menus from like 6 restaurants in the area until 9pm (Chili's, Tony Roma's, etc) Firefly restaurant (tapas) right next door. Large room service menu until 2am. I would not hesitate to stay here again. FYI....they only have one shuttle so ave wait was 10-15min for pick up. Once waited for 40min to be picked up at the Wynn so if that is a big deal for you, you might want to rethink staying here or pay for a taxi. Shuttle runs until midnight.</p><br>Best Breakfast!<p>We had a few issues the first night (construction at 7am) but they quickly changed our room and gave us marriott points to compensate for our lack of sleep! They were very accommodating (we have a baby so they gave us a very nice pack n play and fridge for the milk).

Best part: BREAKFAST!!! We had Belgian waffles with strawberries, granola, and whipped cream every morning for breakfast! There eggs seemed real as well :)</p><br>Love the Breakfast and Shuttle<p>Free Shuttle from the airport and to the strip!!! Free awesome hot/cold breakfast!!! Seriously, saved me $50 from taxis, and the breakfast was awesome. All kind of beverage, pancake, fruits, muffins, eggs... and other things that I can't remember. Room was as normal as it goes. Will definitely visit again.</p><br>A great overnight hotel<p>I stayed here on business this week in one of the newly renovated rooms. The staff were super friendly. The rooms were smallish but comfortable and well equipped. The breakfast was delicious and plentiful. For a simple motel it doesn't come much better than this.</p><br>The most convenient location for departure from McCarran International Airport<p>When I made the reservation I was concerned since in some cities the “airport hotels” may not be in the most convenient or best locations. What a surprise when the Fairfield Inn’s manager called prior to our visit; she wanted to alert me to the fact they were doing some updating to their fourth floor rooms. She did not feel we would be inconvenience in any way, but did not want us to be surprised. She asked if we had any special requests to make our stay enjoyable. I had already requested a first floor room and added we would need to take the shuttle to the airport; she reconfirmed both.
This was our first stay at this property; however, when we arrived we were greeted like we stayed there every week. Very friendly and personable staff; every staff member was friendly and helped in every way possible.
My wife and I are retired and we love to travel; due to our countries economy and the number of people out of work we currently travel exclusively in g the USA. Over the years we have found that Marriott properties set the standard for all hotels and this Fairfield Inn is an example of excellent service, well equipped rooms, and comfortable beds and pillows. For the price they are impossible to beat. Their bathroom is one of the few that has the sink situated with not only the standard mirror over the counter, but an adjustable mirror behind you. This allows a woman to see the back of her hair when curling or fixing her hair. By shuttle, it is just a few minutes from the airport and they offer extended parking if you have a car and traveling from McCarran International Airport.
Room Tip: Shuttle service starts at 4:30 am; extended parking is available if you are flying out of McCarran o...

We've stayed at several places in Las Vegas. This is always our first choice. We're not the only ones that feel that way because this location is sometimes full even if you plan weeks ahead. The location is close to the strip, but far enough away to be quiet and less hectic. The staff is always very friendly, the rooms clean and quiet, and the free breakfast is very nice. They have recently added hot scrambled eggs and sausage to the menu, which was already quite extensive. They use regular weight blankets on the beds instead of the heavier quilt-y ones that are being used by so many other motels now - we like the lighter weight. If you're going there for the pool, you're going to be disappointed. It's quite small. Located right by the side of the parking area and surrounded by a chain link fence. There are no trees or shade. We seldom see anyone using it, but otherwise this place is great.
Room Tip: We've never had a "bad" room, but we always ask for an upper floor. I don't like...

The hotel staff was very courteous and kindly allowed us to leave 30 minutes after we checked into the room.

The fitness center had some especially funky smells..

we went to the residence inn down the road.</p><br>Comfortable, clean, good location, no resort fee!<p>Hotel staff was friendly, and fast. Room was comfortable, we had a good night sleep. Breakfast was really good. Breakfast lady was super nice. There was a storm, a tree fell over in the parking lot, but not the fault of the hotel, and no damage done. They had the tv's back after a short stoppage. Which was also not their fault. The hotel was close to the strip, and I used an employee discount which gave us a fantastic rate!!!!!!!!!!! Marriott hotels are the best.</p><br>5 star service<p>It has been a long time since I have been so impressed with the service of a hotel! Their was a misunderstanding as to when their shuttle left for the airport. But they immediately took responsibility for their error and arranged for a cab to come and get us in the morning. They were willing to store my bags by the front door so I didn't have to haul them all to my room just to haul them back down the next morning. Super impressed! Thanks Fairfield!!!</p><br>Nice place without The Strip Hassle<p>You don't have to pay the resort fee here. We liked this hotel, the only problem was that it was very crowded for the breakfast bar. The breakfast area is nice but the crowd made it difficult to get any food. The kids enjoyed the pool, parking was good.
Room Tip: Rooms all nice, get rooms near the back, elevator was near back door.
