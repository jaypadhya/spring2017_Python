<html><head><h3>Fairfield Inn Las Vegas Airport Hotel Reviews Page 15</h3></head><body><br>Great place to stay<p>We stayed for 3 nights and had a great experience, no problems, very friendly staff, easy check in. It's a great property and the GM runs a great hotel, very nice:) A good location, with clean amenities. The free breakfast helps, especially when traveling with young children. A reasonable rate, free shuttle, easy access, highly recommend a nice location and stay.</p><br>Marrioot Hotel<p>Stayed at this Hotel twice in Early July on the way back and forth to Olympia Washington Staff both times very helpful and friendly. This Hotel is reasonably priced and is a good location off the strip, they have a shuttle to and from the Airport and it also drops off near the Venetian Hotel and Convention Center. When we were ready to return to the Hotel a phone call to the Fairfield and they were there to pick us up within 5 minutes. They offer a decent Breakfast as well for all Guests. This is a very Old Marriott and is showing its wear, rooms are standard with No Suites. It definitely needs an upgrade, Would consider a different Marriott Location the next time in Vegas
Room Tip: Ask for a room on the f4th floor, you will not hear your upstairs neighbors

My car said 117 at 630 pm and my hotel room was cold in the 5 minutes. It was great. Closed the blackouts and set the thermo on 71 . The beds have a memory foam topper so it's a comfortable bed. The sheets and top sheet are all cotton and they feel great , nice and cool, the breakfast is nice . You just cruise down stairs grad and go if you like or have a seat and watch the news. I like the variety of fresh fruit ,cold and hot cereal, sausage, eggs, milf, juice, pastries, etc. Their is an elevator and a set of stairs. We stayed in 340. We had a view of the parking lot but it really didn't matter cause we never opened them:) the pool was nice in the evening when it was only 115. It doesn't smell in the hotel as far as I can tell. It's a great roomy stay with HBO and cable channels, a large comfy tv chair with ottoman. Only in plus. No micro or fridge. But the have some reasonably priced snacks in the lobby. The ice cream is great.within walking distance is Terribles store . It's across from Mandalay Bay so you can go to the aquarium on the shuttle and not have to drive. It also goes to the monorail. Great bonus. Great way to see Vegas. It does not run 24 hours though. But it's a block over from the strip if you need a cab. I like this hotel. And the ladies that fix the breakfast do a great job. Also theirs free Internet. Really. Streaming fast Internet. And guess what.......NO RESoRT FEES! Yeah and the have a business center and a gym! Just go their. You will be satisfied for the price and location.
Room Tip: 340 or on the 40s side of the building. This way you don't have to be near the hwy or airport:)

Pros: Staffs were nice and friendly, complimentary breakfast, clean room and bed, equipped with TV and refrigerator.

Cons: Air con
Room Tip: Room at the back of the building is very closed to the back entrance from the parking lot.
See more room tips</p><br>my stay<p>upon arrival the staff in the lobby had an attitude an older lady maybe she was having a bad day! we checked in really quick and easy only to discover our room had a really bad smell...opend up the fridge and it smelled like nothing but smoke. It was a really really Hot day taht day and our AC was not working they sent up a repair guy but he was no help. Did not want to make a big deal but was tired of spending more time in the hall way (because our room was extremly hot) than in our room i called down stairs and they changed our room to next door the ac was just a little better. Overall i did not have a great experince and i would never ever stay there again!</p><br>Solid hotel near airport<p>Stayed here for a night recently and have absolutely no complaints. Very close to airport, reasonably-priced, and great staff. Full breakfast is included for the price. Would definitely recommend to others just in the area wanting a good place to stay for a night; nothing fancy.</p><br>very helpful staff, clean and comfortable rooms<p>We stayed for one night in Las Vegas on the way back from a national park hiking trip in Utah. The staff went above and beyond as our flight left at 530a the next day - they packed us a to-go breakfast and answered all our questions patiently and with a smile. It's about 3 miles from airport just up the road. The free shuttle allowed us to return our car the night before, picked us up from the airport and allowed us to go to the Strip as well for some end of vacation sightseeing. The shuttle driver, front desk and check out manager were all professional and excellent. The rooms are clean and comfortable and a good size. Would recommend this hotel. Also an EXCELLENT Thai place, Satay Thai 1 block from the hotel - definitely check it out!</p><br>average fairfield<p>Everything is average with this hotel. Double beds not queen size. One advantage is the shuttle service.Stayed here for the shuttle service to the airport that most Marriott properties do not provide.</p><br>Exceeded my expectations!<p>Great stay thanks to a very clean room, comfy bed, cool AC, easy/convenient shuttle from the airport & to the Strip and most importantly excellent, genuinely friendly service. Stormy was phenomenal, on the phone, at check-in & on duty. She deserves a raise. For a select service hotel, this place is worth every penny and provides a tremendous value!</p><br>Recommendable and affordable 3* hotel, no Bellagio frills<p>We stayed 1 night in april and only used this hotel as a stopover (no visit to the strip or other attractions in L.V).
The hotel is good and well maintained, situated 1 mile from the strip and 2 miles from airport (free airport shuttle). Small and refreshing swimmingpool.
The rooms are medium size (26mÂ²), comfortable, clean. Quiet at night. Good beds, good and silent airco, flatscreen, fridge, coffee provided. Clean bathroom, all amenities. Free Wifi.
Breakfast buffet is good.
Conclusion : value for your money, recommendable.</p><br></body></html>
