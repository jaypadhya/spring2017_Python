<html><head><h3>Fairfield Inn Las Vegas Airport Hotel Reviews Page 7</h3></head><body><br>Friendly and helpful staff<p>Very happy with our stay. The staff is helpful with anything you need and will go out of their way to help you. The building is a little dated but decorated tastefully and modern. Rooms are clean and comfortable. We enjoyed the free shuttle to and from the airport.</p><br>Decent place<p>This place was ok....bathroom tub was scuffed up and very low water pressure.
The room is a little dated but quite comfortable. Bathroom was a little small, but it worked fine for a single traveler.
Very close to strip and would only stay here if we had a car. (which we did)</p><br>Excellent choice<p>Very satisfied with our recent stay.
The main feature to comment on is the staff - every single person working the front desk over the days we stayed there was really fantastic. More then helpful and extremely friendly. Top marks to the staff - especially Mayra!
As for the hotel, it is basic and maybe not even the best Fairfield Inn I have stayed in but the rooms are satisfactory, free breakfast is good, shuttle bus very convenient (to/from airport or Wynn) and for Las Vegas the price is good.
If you don't want to spend several hundred dollars to stay in one of the smoky big casino hotels (why would you?) - this is an excellent choice!</p><br>Great Hotel - Not far from the strip<p>Arrived to the hotel a little early and they allowed us to check in. The room was nice and clean. The bathroom we open and clean. The breakfast had a wide variety of food - cereal, breads, muffins, waffles, eggs & sausage, yogurt, milk and juices. The beds were very comfortable (I did not use the pillows because I brought my own). The TV had lots of stations and had good reception. The check in and check out process was easy. The safe was a little stand-offish, but nice.

The only ding was the toilet would refile every hour or so during the night</p><br>Good Economical and Clean Lodging in Vegas<p>People dont stay at the Fairfield Inn in Vegas for all of the amenities, they stay because it is clean and economical. Its about 10 minutes by car/cab to the strip or 20 minutes walking. I like this hotel because Im not spending 200 dollars a night at the Venetian, but I can go 5 minutes and enjoy the Venetian! I dont come to Vegas to camp out in a room, so this hotel serves the purpose of an economical, clean, safe place to sleep thats usually under 100 dollars and doesnt have seedy people or prostitutes hanging around the lobby or outside! There are plenty of restaurants in walking distance if you want to avoid the strip.

The staff is friendly, parking is free, rooms are clean and modern with mini refrigerators. Shoot straight up Paradise from the airport and you are there in 15 minutes!. For my money, I think this is one of the best hotel deals in Las Vegas
Room Tip: Stay away from the rooms on the first floor near the conference rooms. The noise can be pretty inte...

We had tickets to a show but was afraid that we would not get a chance to use them because we were staying off strip. The hotel has a shuttle that takes you to the Wynn (for Strip action). We were able to see the show :)). We were concerned that the early morning shuttle would not give us time to catch our flight. The driver was so professional and timely. We got to the airport and through security with time to spare. Now, the hotel is older and has been refurbished. Don't expect the typical Fairfield. It's more like a refreshed 1970s motor inn. The lobby furniture needs a deep cleaning (modern but has spots). The room was a typical room. The bed was comfortable. The linens were clean. The bathroom was adequate (the fixtures need to be updated and the toilet should match the seat). The hotel is also close to restaurants and a casino. For the most part, the hotel served the intended purpose. Good for an overnight to catch an early flight.</p><br>Great service experience<p>Stayed at this hotel one night to catch our flight next morning. We checked in this hotel in the evening and had a room looked recently renovated. The only downside was the air conditioning unit in the room, very noisy. The breakfast was ok, a bit over crowded but as expected. We reserved a shuttle to the airport in the morning and received a call from front desk and let us know that the shuttle would be 5 to 10 minutes late. They let us know ahead of time, so we don't have to wait in the lobby. A small thing but showed me the quality of the service.</p><br>Good location, clean rooms, nice staff, lax management<p>I've stayed here several times during conferences that fill up the Strip and jack up prices everywhere. It is quiet, clean, comfortable, and has remodeled rooms. The individual employees all seem fine, but the overall management seems much sloppier than I remember. Out of 4 days (so far) this time, my coffee has not been replenished on three of them (even when I've been out of the room by a little after 9am, and gone all day). A package sent to me (and recorded as delivered by the sender) was lost (hotel says it they never received it), the manager seemed unconcerned and didn't even bother to offer to follow up. Not very professional, IMO.</p><br>Wonderful hotel with caring personnel<p>Recently our 2 hour layover in Las Vegas turned into a three week medical emergency and I chose to stay at this Fairmont Inn. From day one, the people at the front desk were caring and understanding to my circumstances. I had no idea how long we would be in their hotel but they worked with me to periodically extend my stay and always expressed concern for our situation. The shuttle transported me to the hospital every day and brought me back each night for a comforting sleep. The shuttle drivers were extremely considerate of my circumstances and never failed to ask about my husbands condition. Everyone at this hotel did what they could to ease what was a terrible situation and I thank them for this. Marriott should be proud of each of them.</p><br>Nice <p>After spending to weeks at the Wyndham, I can only say that not only the location for two days was good, but also the courtesy was way more better, by far than the Wyndham... Marriott's has never let us down, no matter what.</p><br></body></html>
