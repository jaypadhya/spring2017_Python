<html><head><h3>Fairfield Inn Las Vegas Airport Hotel Reviews Page 9</h3></head><body><br>close to the strip with affordable price<p>nice people, room, fitness center... everything you need for a good stay in Las Vegas. All the personal are always very friendly. There is a swimming pool and the free breakfast is a decent one. If you don't want to spend a lot and stay in a quiet, clean, nice room... this is the place. And they have the 100% promise of total satisfaction.</p><br>Great location for Convention Center attendee<p>The shuttles are convenient for the airport and Convention Center, and you are also close enough to walk. Every single person I dealt with over the phone and in person was so pleasant and aimed to please the customer. My room was clean and quiet.

Breakfast was good with plenty of choices.

I would stay there again even when visiting Vegas while not on business.</p><br>Great place!<p>Excellent customer service. Great price! Good food. Convenient shuttle. Our room was clean. We had a stain on our bedspread but they changed it, no problem. Good layout of room. Microwave, fridge, coffee maker. Hot chocolate and coffee in lobby with fresh apples.</p><br>A great spot to get some rest<p>The FFI off of Paradise Rd. in Las Vegas boasts three important value props - 1. Shuttle service to/from the airport, 2. It's within walking distance to the Sands convention center and 3. It's a great place to get some sleep, while battling long days/nights, when working a trade show in Las Vegas. The staff is great and breakfast is better than others I've recently stayed at.</p><br>Great Airport Hotel<p>We booked the Fairfield Inn Airport as we we would be arriving late and heading out early the next day to head to southern Utah. We were checked in by a friendly staffer and offered choices from their little convenience shop which was a nice touch that we appreciated. The room was spacious, well equipped and spotless. And quiet. The included breakfast included hot options as well as standard continental choices.</p><br>Reasonable, great service<p>Staying at the hotel was a last minute choice when other plans fell through. The front desk personnel couldn't have been nicer and were extremely helpful with dinner recommendations ("Firefly" next door). The room was clean and adequate, no complaints. The AC was great, given how hot it was outside. And breakfast was a great benefit. Stay if you need to be away from the strip at a casual, friendly establishment.</p><br>Good Stay and Good Value<p>Stayed here to attend a conference at a nearby casino. It is comfortable, clean and the staff was always very friendly and helpful. It has a lot of food choices within walking distance so it is good for those who didn't have a car like me. The airport shuttle is a great convenience as well! Breakfast is a little more sparse that what you will find at other places, but it has everything you need. The fitness center has two treadmills, a bike and a lat pull-down machine.</p><br>Wow a very nice boutique Fairfield Inn<p>What a great totally remodeled Fairfield Inn. It really felt like a very upscale boutique hotel. This was directly after a six night stay at an upgraded room at Planet Hollywood. We stayed at Planet Hollywood to attend the Usual Suspects Network (USN) G6 gathering knife show. We booked a room at this Fairfield on day seven to get 10 hours of rest before our red eye back home to Florida.
This hotel was so nice and the girls at the desk were so nice and professional that next year when we go to Vegas for the USN G7 we are going to stay at this hotel rather than the casino hotel on the strip. The room was like a total upscale sanctuary. My wife and I really loved this hotel and it's only a couple of miles from the strip and the Airport.
Room Tip: All the rooms are great and stylishly remodeled.

This Hotel just approx 1.2 miles from strip ...</p><br>Good Value<p>This is a clean, efficient and convenient hotel. The shuttle service to the airport and the Wynne was excellent and timely, despite very heavy traffic in the city. Front desk was welcoming and helpful. Breakfast was very good. There are no views at this hotel. It's functional and was perfect for the one night before flying out of Vegas. Several restaurants just steps away.</p><br></body></html>
