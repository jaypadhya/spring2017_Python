<html><head><h3>Fairfield Inn Las Vegas Airport Hotel Reviews Page 25</h3></head><body><br>Can't ask for more<p>As the previous 10 reviews say, it is clean and comfortable and worth more than what you paid for. There is none of that unpleasant cigarette smell as Marriott hotels are smoke free. I love the unlimited free breakfast which has already thinned down at the La Quinta which is in the same category as this hotel. The room may be a bit cramped but it is still OK. The hotel is a bit older compared to the other Fairfield Inn at the other side of I-15.</p><br>Quiet, Clean, Close to Strip, INCOMPETENT front desk workers!<p>I liked everything about this hotel except for the front desk staff. The breakfast was delicious and always had a hot special (not just cold cereal and donuts). When I stayed it was apple cinnamon waffles and they were great. The room itself was quite comfortable and clean. The whole stay was very quiet with no loud guests or children in the hallway. There was a pretty, clean pool right outside our window, but nobody was ever swimming in it. The hotel was very close to the strip, but not so close as to be annoying. It was a quick walk across a nice palm-tree lined street. There were also some good restaurants between the hotel and the strip: Bahama Breeze and Cozymels. The shuttle drivers were friendly and prompt, but that was where my happiness with the staff ended.

The front desk workers almost made us miss the second half of our trip (which was a bus ride to Los Angeles and two days at Manhattan Beach). We packed our things on our last day, called down to the front desk almost an hour before our bus was set to leave and asked them to call us a cab (believe me, we would have called ourselves, but the hotel staff TOLD us that they prefer it when the hotel themself calls--as they know the proper coordinates to go to, etc). They said they would call them and that we should come down about 10 minutes before we needed to leave to wait for the cab. Well, we came down when they told us to and they hadn't even CALLED the cab yet. They called them THEN when we needed to LEAVE then and they told us to wait outside for them. So we go out in the 100 degree heat and wait...and wait...and wait some more.

I went back in three times to ask if they had any info on where the cab was as we waited for FORTY FIVE minutes! When the cab finally arrived we were pretty irate, both with the desk workers and with the cab driver for being so late after the first call, but what really got us was when the bus driver told us that each time we went in to tell the front desk that we were still waiting, they would call the cab company and request ANOTHER cab! Not call and ask them where our cab was. So they were just causing confusion and suspicion at the cab company as we were moving down and down and down the list. The cab driver said that all they needed to do to get them to come straight to us was to SAY that we had a bus to catch and were in a hurry. But did they do that? NO! They just kept calling and making NEW requests for cabs! Not emphasizing the need for the first cab.

Basically, the hotel stay was nice, it was LEAVING the hotel that was the problem. If you stay here, just call your own cabs and don't listen to anything the front desk staff says!</p><br>Great Value, good service<p>This hotel is off-strip, quiet and comfortable. A good place to relax after the hustle and bussle of the major attractions. The hotel was clean and well kept, the staff were friendly and very helpful. The complimentary breakfast, internet access, bus service and local phone calls were an added attraction. Very good value for money, would definitely stay there again.</p><br>Good place to stay<p>Stayed here for two days while on a little birthday celebration trip. Opted for the Fairfield instead of a Strip hotel because I booked two rooms and wanted my Rewards points for spending the money.

The lobby and adjoining breakfast room is nicer than most Fairfield Inns. Although the free breakfast did not have any eggs or bacon, it was very good with a variety of selections and an attendant who constantly insured an ample supply. Food serivce area and tables were very clean.There are two computers with large flat screen monitors and a printer in the breakfast area for free use by guests.

The rooms are nicely furnished-a bit nicer and more substantial than mosty Fairfields. Free internet in the room. Room was quiet and comfortable.

There is a courtesy van for the Airport and the hotel is 5 minutes from the Strip so if you want the excitement of the Strip and the casinos, it is very close by.

Bottom line-if you are looking for a room less costly than the Strip or want the quiet of a non-casino hotel, you can't go wrong staying here. There really was nothing negative.</p><br>A very nice place to sleep - nice breakfast.<p>This is NOT a resort. It's a very nice place to sleep with comfortable beds and a very nice breadfast included for what we think is a reasonable price. We had a king room on a Thrusday night for $110, senior rate. Far from the strip? What, were you walking? It's about 4 blocks - drive over to the strip and park in the free parking that all the resorts offer. Easy check in - no lines. Same with check out. Close enough to be convient but away from the noise and crowds of the strip. A very nice breakfast including "do-it-yourself" waffles if you'd like. Its called "airport" because there are 2 Fairfield Inns in Las Vegas and it's the one that's nearest to the airport, but don't let that concern you for one minute. It's NOT that close. It's parallel to the main "going" area of the strip, just about 4 blocks south(?) - I always get my directions mixed up there. It's in a nice area and we think it's a good choice for an overnight stay in Vegas. Fairfield Inns are primarily designed for business travelers, but we often choose them and have usually been very happy.</p><br>Nice Hotel<p>Nice hotel but far from the strip. Great staff. So so breakfast. Do yourself a favor and stay on the strip</p><br>You can do better then this....<p>The first thing I want to mention is that the Fairfield Inn is a clean, nice place to stay. Ok.That's all the nice things I can say about it. Now here goes. The Fairfield Inn is BORING with a capital B. No restaurants, no bar, no casino, no nothing. The hotel has only 4 floors and has no views. As with most Las Vegas hotels, it has limited TV selections and expensive Pay-per-view offerings. But in the hotel's defense, it does have a daily continental breakfast .(Yawn)

I spent 12 days there while working at the Las Vegas Convention Center and I couldn't even get a refrigerator in my room. They kept tellng me that I was first on the list to get the next available one. After 7 days of that, I realized that I was being lied to by the staff. It is very difficult to stay at a hotel for 12 days and not be able to have any snacks or drinks in your room. I can't believe that the Marriott Hotel chain can't afford to add a few more refrigerators to their rooms. To me, this is an absolute neccessity.

By the way, this hotel has no King beds. (according to the staff) All rooms come with 2 double beds.

Another wierd thing about this hotel is that it is all completely non-smoking. (All Marriott Hotels have gone 100% non-smoking) I don't smoke so that does not bother me so much. What does bother me is the extremes that this hotel goes through to keep people from smoking in their rooms. They went to the extent of screwing shut the windows, disabling the bathroom exhaust fan and the worst thing is that the room door has a gap at the bottom of the door at least 1 and 1/2 inches high. You can see and here anyone that walks past your room. That is bordering on paranoia if you ask me.

The Fairfield Inn is not real inexpensive either. The rates are comparable to a lot of the casino hotels that have much more to offer.

It's not that I don't recommend this hotel but certainly you can do better for the price. If you are going to Vegas, find a hotel that allows you to have a little fun and won't lie to you.</p><br>Not bad<p>Clean and comfortable room. Staff was friendly. Nice business center. Typical chain breakfast buffet - nothing to get excited about. A bit pricey for what you get.</p><br>Nice alternative to the strip<p>Stayed here vs. the strip due to expensive rooms because of a large conference in town. Not far from the strip. Room was very nice, although SMALL. Bathroom was a bit cramped with not much counter space. Smoke-free hotel. Free internet. Adequate parking. Only complaint was no restaurant. If you're unable to stay on the strip, this is a good alternative.</p><br>Great, quite, off the Strip<p>What a nice find in Las Vegas. If you want a quite proptery, off the strip. This is it. The property was small and quite. Nice free breakfast. The bed was amazing, complete with down pillows. The bathroom was very nice with plenty of towels. The room also had free internet. The staff was very nice and friendly. There was also a free shuttle to and from the airport.

Will stay here again!</p><br></body></html>
