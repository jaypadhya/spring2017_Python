Their comments have been precisely correct. First impressions can really set the stage for any activity. First impressions at this Fairfield Inn have all been very positive: When calling the hotel to make the reservation, the front desk personnel were very courteous and efficient - you could hear the smile in their voice and were immediately aware that you are a valued Customer. The shuttle van driver arrived at the airport before the expected time and also extended the concept that each Customer is highly valued. Check-In was equally courteous and efficient. The property is very well maintained. The rooms are spacious and clean, with complimentary high speed internet access, a desk for work, refrigerator and coffee maker, plus very comfortable bedding. Complementary breakfast is offered in the morning including: egg & bacon biscuit sandwich, several cereals, hard boiled eggs, breads (bagels, muffins & breads for toast), waffle makers, yogurts, fruits, coffee, tea and juices - all-in-all, quite an array. The breakfast area accommodates a lot of guests and is kept clean. With all these positives, the best remains the Staff - each person dealt with has always demonstrated a keen focus on providing Exceptional Customer Service. These comments are consistent for several stays at the during the Oct-Dec 2012 time frame. There is no doubt they will remain true for stays during 2013. Thank You, Fairfield Inn Las Vegas Staff, your Great work is appreciated and commended!</p><br>Wonderful staff<p>We were just here for one night. The previous reviews about Stormi are absolutely correct. She offered the most delightful check-in I have ever experienced. Upbeat, sincere and thorough---give her a raise! :-) Even though the property is scheduled for a renovation, we found our room and common areas to be very clean and well maintained. Good breakfast too. Thanks again!</p><br>Great staff, subpar rooms<p>The friendliness of the staff compensated for the drab and dreary accommodations but I doubt I will stay here again. We tried this property due to the airport shuttle and long term parking option. Stormi was super at check in and arranged for bag breakfasts given that we were leaving at 4 a.m. The shuttle driver and Rob, the overnight desk agent, were both very helpful. As for the room - think mismatched yard sale furniture that was chipped and sagging. The room was small and the sink didn't drain very quickly. Look, this is Vegas; for what I paid for this room I could have been in luxury on the Strip. I have stayed in numerous properties in Las Vegas over the years and this was the worst physical plant that I've seen. The shuttle was prompt in picking us up last night but we picked up the car and headed to a different - and much more comfortable - Marriott property.</p><br>Nice stay<p>Check in was fast, and staff even checked with the hubby if room was ok. The room was small when you compare it with Residence Inn but you have the usual amenities, mini ref, coffeemaker, microwave. and wifi in the room. We got a very good deal for the room $120 for 2 nights. (stayed Nov 20-22) and they don't charge resort fees. I like it that you don't smell cigarette smoke so common in the hotels by the strip and room is clean. It was off the strip, so this may not be for you if you want to walk around. They offer shuttle service to Bally's though until midnight. Continental breakfast is from 6:30am to 9am, and they really put them away by 9am. They had the waffle maker and that was nice.</p><br>Awesome, as usual!<p>Love these guys. They take great care of me every time. I stay here about once as week and have always been impressed with the friendliness and professionalism of the staff. Very close to the airport and the strip so access is easy. Very responsive and reliable shuttle.</p><br>Friendly, close to strip and airport<p>I was looking for a Marriott property close to the airport with a shuttle, as I had an early morning flight out. I am a Marriott guy, so the Fairfield by the airport on Paradise Avenue was perfect. Larger than normal eating area with free breakfast, great rates, less than $85. Comfortable bed. No airport noise. Very Good restaurants within walking distance and very friendly front desk staff.

Especially Stormi who was a smiling bright spot in any bodys business day. Thank you Stormi!
Room Tip: face west. Had a nice sunset over the strip and My Charleston in the background.

The time for breakfast service was until 9:30 but nothing was replenished after 9:00 and a lot was gone. Still a decent value for Las Vegas.</p><br>Good hotel, but relatively too expensive for the room and service you get<p>Fairfield Inn at Paradise Blvd in Las Vegas is a clean motel with good staff. Standard rooms are small, as is the pool. So the nightly rate of 160 dollars is just too steep. Okay, there is the complementary breakfast, but I have visited cheaper motels with a better breakfast (e.g. La Quinta a block away from Fairfield).

One short note about their service: I notified front desk about the bathtub having trouble to drain the water. They promptly fixed that and added 1500 reward points to my Marriott account. Now that is customer focus.</p><br>Great People!<p>The Fairfield Inn Las Vegas has the nicest, most respectful staff! They always refer to you by your last name and are always very friendly. The rooms are very clean and new improvements have made the rooms even more comfortable.</p><br>There is nothing wrong with this Fairfield Inn; Do not hesitate to stay here.<p>Returning for the 3rd time to an annual convention for my national/North American group . . . but this time, chose to stay at an inexpensive, proximate, smoke-free/gambling-free lodging that just so happened to be a Marriott chain. This property is extremely well-located approx. a mile east from the southern end of the Las Vegas, not too bad a walk from the back entrances of the Sands, Harrah's, Bellagio, NY/NY, etc.

Although most of my review is positive, I have to say that coming here at night, the entrance, lighting, surrounding properties, etc. is uhmm, underwhelming. The place looks like it could be kind of dingy . . . but it's not. It's just as welcoming and comfortable as any other FfI.

Having a car here is ideal, because like most Fairfield Inn's, the parking is free, clean, convenient (no garage or shuttle or valet) and right outside the 2 or 3 secure entrances to the 4 story Z-shaped structure. Then, one is literally 10~15 minutes away from most locations south of Sahara Ave, INCLUDING the airport, which is less time than it takes to walk from one end of the huge hotels to the other.

My King room was very well maintained, moveable tv-monitor, refrigerator and microwave. Bed was super-comfortable, bathroom/shower was typical - functional and clean (bow-shaped shower bar, hair-dryer, coffee-maker, the usual "plusses" at a FfI).
.
Internet was reasonably good - by IBahn. Not the fastest (~ 1MByte/second), but functional and free! Breakfast was ok too -- not the best I've ever had at a FfI or Residence Inn but functional, well-organized, cleanly presented and definitely free. These are two reasons that save one $25+/day vs. staying at a big resort.

Manager seemed to be involved, covering for a front-desk worker in the am when she was busy with guests. I love to see this leadership by example and is probably a reason why recent review for this property are better than the older reviews.
Room Tip: Parking lot and surrounding neighborhood appears to be a bit dingy (although it's actually quite...
