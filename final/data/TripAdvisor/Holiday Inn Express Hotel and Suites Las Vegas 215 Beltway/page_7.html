We enjoyed our stay. The hotel is only two years and its very clean. Its located about 5 miles from the strip and since we had a car this didnt worry us. This is a good hotel just to stay away from the strip. For example a bottle of water in the strip is $3.60 outside the strip where ordinary people live (where this this hotel is located) its only $1.00.</p><br>Very Nice<p>Hotel is like new. Very clean, very nicely decorated. Comfortable beds, friendly staff. Nice continental breakfast. We definitely would stay here again. It's in sort of an underdeveloped location without many amenities close by, but easy freeway access, which is what we wanted.</p><br>very nice Holiday Inn Express<p>Holiday Inn Express is always our favorite place to stay. Off strip a few blocks. Very friendly staff who helped with eating suggestions and directions. very nice room and bed. bathroom also nice and clean. Only drawback was airport shuttle did not run on weekends. Why I have no idea. Same nice free breakfast as other H.I.E.</p><br>very pleasant stay<p>hotel workers very friendly rooms very clean beds very comfortable no complaints</p><br>Great hotel!<p>My wife, mother in-law and I stayed at the Holiday Inn Express during thanksgiving because of the location to where my mother lives on South Rainbow. The hotel appears to be pretty new, which I think is always a plus. The actual rooms were nice and well appointed. My criteria for a good room is cleanliness, comfortable beds and good showers, and this hotel has this in spades. The cleanliness could have been a little better, but overall, a nice room. The hotel serves a typical holiday inn breakfast with continental items as well as some hot items. The hotel also had an okay excersise room, but be careful of the treadmill! The treadmills create huge amounts of static, and if you aren't wearing the right clothing, it will really shock you (There is a sign warning of this). The hotel also has a pool and hot tub, but we didn't use it because it was too cold. Overall the hotel is a really good value, the staff is friendly, and it is approximately 10-15 minutes from the strip.</p><br>Excellent value, friendly staff, great breakfast!<p>Stayed one night, visiting relatives. Great and stylish room. Good to know you can pay less, and still have a stylish/updated room to stay in. Stayed last year when the hotel just opened, was so impressed, stayed again this year. Great breakfast included!</p><br>Highly Recommended<p>Stayed 10/24/09: The beds are a dream...the best of the 5 hotels of my trip out west. Overall a very clean and comfortable place with nice, up-to-date decor. When I had a little issue at the desk the manager came through with good customer service. The breakfast was very decent: cheese omelette (prepared in advance), bacon, hard cooked eggs, yogurt, muffins, juice, cereal, bagels, etc.
Regarding location: I didn't mind being off the strip (about a 10-15 minute drive on city streets, straight up Rainbow Blvd, then turn right - depending where you want to be on the strip.).... in fact I preferred being away from the hustle bustle- though I'm not a big casino person. We flew into Vegas, rented a car & came here from the airport for an overnight stay prior to departing for the national parks...we only visited the casinos briefly.</p><br>Great overnighter<p>Not a huge amount of things to do in the way of amenities, but a perfect place to stay overnight on business. Great accessibility, close to some good restaurants and bars, but also far enough away to be quiet and peaceful. Book a room facing east and watch the sun rise across the mountain range!!</p><br>Outstanding Help in Our Hour of Need<p>My wife and I were booked in for one night at the HI Express on the Beltway on arrival in Vegas. The flight was delayed by 6 hours and we finally arrived at 6.20am, just as the sun was coming up. The hotel was esy to find despite being sleep-deprived and the duty staff could not have been more helpful, giving us a late late checkout time of 3pm. Breakfast was fresh and served with a smile - just what we needed after 30 hours without much sleep. The room was really clean, quiet, large and well appointed, with a hyper comfortable bed. Those 5 hours were the best sleep we had in 2 weeks in the US.

We cannot praise the hotel enought for all they did for us - if only they had been running the airline!</p><br></body></html>
