<html><head><h3>Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Las Vegas 215 Beltway Reviews Page 1</h3></head><body><br>Limited Parking<p>I stayed for one night in November 2015 before flying out of McCarren Airport. The hotel is clean and well-maintained. They even had the breakfast buffet out early (6 am) on Sunday. My one and only complaint is the lack of parking for their guests. I returned from dinner at 8 pm and there were no parking spaces available. They share a lot with a sports bar, so that is part of the problem. I had to park in a fire zone, along with 4 or 5 other cars. What would have happened if an emergency vehicle (ambulance or fire truck) had to come that night? The clerk at the front desk was very apologetic, but that is not her fault. GET MORE PARKING!</p><br>Clean, quiet...very professional staff<p>Have stayed several times and will continue to stay here on my stop-overs in Vegas. Parking for my truck/toy hauler...professional staff at the front desk, always pleasant...clean rooms...quiet night's sleep. Perfect.</p><br>Over-Rated and Over-Priced<p>We chose this motel because it was the only highly-rated motel on this side of Las Vegas. However, after staying the night we consider it both over-rated and much over-priced. This justified the over-all rating of "2.0".

On the positive side, the room was clean, quiet (except for occupants overhead walking around at 530 am), good wi-fi, the outdoor pool and hot tub were clean, and a very good breakfast was served by an attentive and cheerful attendant. The neighborhood appears to be safe.

On the negative side, parking lot lighting was poor, the Business Center was "Out of Order", the bed was like a rock (a flat rock), and the window AC kept turning off every few seconds as we progressively lowered the temperature to nearly 60 to get it cool (and there was no continuous fan setting, making it difficult to sleep with the constant on/off). The pool/hot tub area are oddly on the street side rather than to the rear of the building, and so there is a lot of traffic noise.

A warning to those who making reservations: this location has a 48-hour cancellation policy, unusual for a non-resort facility -- and the owner will not flex even 30 minutes from that policy.

Overall, a mixed but overall negative experience. We will choose a less convenient location in the future rather than stay here again.
Room Tip: Select an even-numbered (non-street side) room. Be aware of 48-hour cancellation policy with zero fl...

The hotel was clean and comfortable. The beds are cozy. We stayed a Friday and Saturday night in June. It was nice that the Hotel was not crazy busy and noisy like we would find on the strip. The pool was empty each afternoon as well when we were there. The rooms are a little dated but other than a little peeling wallpaper the rooms are comfortable. We only slept and showered here so the Hotel suited our needs perfectly. We didn't get the opportunity to check out the complimentary breakfast. The Hotel is located in a good area. There is a Dunkin Donuts across the street, a BIG plus in our book.

Room tips: you can never go wrong with a top floor room away from the elevator.</p><br>A hotel without gambling<p>This is a very ordinary Holiday Inn Express. On the outside it appears modern, but the rooms are very dated. The breakfast menu was similar to other hotels but way too crowded. If I stay in a holiday Inn in Las Vegas again, it will not be this one.
Room Tip: Away from elevators and fire exit.

The man at the counter was very nice and happy to help and look up my rewards account. The room was clean and fresh. It is close to the City, but far enough away to avoid the dirt and grime you'll find closer to the strip. It seems to be in a safe, good area and I felt comfortable inside and out. Free Breakfast, Wifi, comfortable rooms. This is our new hotel for Las Vegas from now on! Thank you for a great stay!</p><br>A black eye for this Holiday Inn Express<p>If this had been the usual, uneventful Vegas stay of four days for a conference, chances are I would have had an "acceptable" experience and had nothing more to contribute here, other than to echo Dom De Luise's comment in "History of the World, Part 1," "nice..., not THRILLING..., but nice..." However, the unusual circumstances surrounding this stay lead me to decry this hotel as customer-negligent, at best.
I reserved a room for four nights; the first at $136 and the following three at $99. I prepaid the entire reservation, by credit card. However, my flight from Grand Junction CO was delayed overnight. Knowing I was going to be unable to check in for the first night, I called the hotel and asked them not to cancel the entire reservation, but to "let it stand," in other words, charge the first and remaining nights as If nothing had happened.
To my surprise, after I checked out, I found that I had been billed an additional $151.20 for the first night. So, effectively, I was charged twice, for a night on which I did not even stay at the hotel. Holiday Inn's central reservation department informed me that the manager of the hotel was the only person who could deal with the problem. Six months later, after no less than ten phone calls, the situation has not been resolved. On only one occasion was I able to reach the manager, Mr. Mark Fletcher, in person. Mr. Fletcher admitted the error, and avowed that the problem would be remedied. It wasn't. Nine subsequent calls have gone unanswered, unacknowledged and presumably ignored. This conduct is unprofessional and reflects poorly on a nationally-recognized brand, as well as this hotel and its management, in particular.</p><br>Perfect Except for One Small Thing...<p>When I began planning my annual pilgrimage to Las Vegas in January for the annual Consumer Electronics Show, I sat and considered all the horrible places off the strip that I had stayed in in years past.

This year I was determined to avoid that mistake. My goal was to find a place that was cheap (relatively speaking), clean and quiet.

This particular Holiday Inn hit 2.5 out of 3 for my criteria.

Pros:

-Clean. The entire hotel is non-smoking, probably one of the few in the entire city that way. Rooms are immaculate. Bathroom is clean. Common areas, hallways, elevator...all kept to a very high standard.
-Affordable. For only $180 a night during peak CES time, that was at least 50% less than say Luxor or Tropicana, both of which I had stayed at previously and didn't like.
-No casino. Maybe this is a negative for you. It was a positive for me.
-Free Wi-Fi. Hallelujah! All my devices had free access to Wi-Fi. No irritating $15.95 fees like other places.
-Plenty of electrical outlets. Obviously the designers built these rooms with business travelers in mind. There was a dedicated small box on the night table that had 2 outlets and a few other ports. Imagine that...as if people might want to actually charge their phones while they sleep! I can't tell you how many times I've hunted for an electrical outlet in other hotels.
-Fridge. Tiny but it works. Kept my Beef Wellington leftovers from Lawry's.
-Microwave. Tiny but it works. Heated up said Beef Wellington.
-Lot of TV channels.
-Great customer service. Every person I spoke with was friendly, fast and helpful.
-Free breakfast buffet. Not the usual carbs-only fare. Scrambled eggs, turkey sausage patties, pastries, juices, coffee, cereal, fruits, etc. All in a nice common area with a TV going.
-Little touches that were nice, like the small cushioned bench by the hallway, perfect for sitting on as you lace up your dress shoes.

Cons:
-It's far from the strip. About 20 minute drive. If you don't have a car, forget about it.
-Nothing around the hotel. A Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf, a sports bar and other misc. stores.
-This was the big one...thin floors. Being on the third floor, I only had one floor above me. But right away I could hear people clomping around above me. What was it with Las Vegas construction and thin floors? This was the second place I stayed at with this problem. It was pretty irritating at first, but I gradually got used to it. If you're a super-sensitive sleeper, ask for the fourth floor.
-Mattress felt as if there was some plasticky covering under the bedsheet, which made a sort of plasticky noise and had a sort of plasticky feel. Not sure what it was, but it wasn't the most comfortable of beds.

In summary, I would come back here in a heartbeat. As a business traveler alone, it fit my needs perfectly, save for the fact it was a tad bit far from the Strip. Were it not for the thin floors, it would be perfect.
Room Tip: Ask for the fourth floor to avoid the noise of people walking above you.

There is a sports bar right next door with plenty of TV's to watch all the games. The free breakfast in the morning is awesome. Not continental --but full breakfast. The lady working in the kitchen is so pleasant, as well as all the staff.
Room Tip: I have stayed in the room right next to lobby, as well as upper floors. They were all great and nois...
