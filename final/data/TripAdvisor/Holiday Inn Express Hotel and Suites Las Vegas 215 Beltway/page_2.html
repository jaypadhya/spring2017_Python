The lobby is always filled with friendly staff and guest. The rooms are beautiful! The staff is charming, professional, and very welcoming. Mark and his team work really hard to make sure your stay is awesome!</p><br>Always a good experience<p>As a Platinum Level IHG Rewards member, I tend to favor IHG branded properties, but this HI Express is located ideally for me near everything that I want to be near, including unlimited shopping, dining and entertainment opportunities. The people are always very friendly and make every effort to accommodate my needs. This where I stay when visiting Vegas for business and for most personal trips.</p><br>Nice Property and Great Staff<p>Have stayed here on numerous occasions. The property is well maintained and the staff is very friendly and courteous. Highly recommended if you are on a business trip to Vegas and want to stay in a quieter area away from the strip. They have free shuttles to the airport and strip is just 10-15 mins away, in case you want to party on weekends. 4 stars from me</p><br>Quiet, good breakfast, close to freeway<p>Stayed here for a night during a roadtrip. Hotel was quiet and clean. I got a good nights sleep. I needed to head out early in the morning, and was pleased to some breakfast items were availble before the posted breakfast time.</p><br>A nice quite spot in LAS VEGAS<p>We go to Vegas each year so my wife can teach at a conference. We are always given a room at some not so great hotel. This year we chose our own place to stay.
We chose wisely.
It's not on the strip so it was nice and quite. The location is good being just off the I-215. Lots of shopping and food near by.
The staff was friendly and the room was clean and comfortable. We had a great view of the strip a few miles away.</p><br>Very nice staff, but ignored my report of bugs (not sure if bedbugs but icky nonetheless)<p>I am a frequent traveler and have seen a lot of hotel rooms. Stayed recently at this hotel and was impressed by the friendly staff at checkin. However, I was awake most of the night itching from something in the bed, all around my ankles and legs. When I checked out I told the front desk I was bitten by something in my bed and asked about the process for getting a refund. He took my number and said the manger would call. Well not only do I have no call from the manager, but there was an additional $40 charged to my credit card after we checked out.</p><br>A Welcome Relief<p>After leaving another hotel because of the gruesome experience of the room we had booked, we were hotel-less. We decided to try Holiday Inn Express--and were delighted. The clerk at the desk Colette had a smile on her face at all times. The room was clean, everything worked, and I loved the modern touch--which surprised me. I tend toward the traditional. The beds were fine, but I did have a problem with the pillows. We'll bring our own next time--and we will return there. Yes, there were airplanes--close by. But after a while, we didn't hear them. The outlets are plentiful, the wi-fi is free!, and the tub was low enough for me to step over (I'm 4'9") with a bar. I couldn't ask for more--except better pillows. The hotel is quiet and we were so glad to be there.
Room Tip: We were on the 4th floor and heard nothing.

It wasn't quiet though with jets taking off every 2 minutes over the hotel from nearby airport. It is very close to Red Rock Canyon. Outdoor pool was okay.</p><br>Great service. Very friendly<p>We chose this hotel as we flew back from LA and just had the one night before flying home. It's not the best place for seeing the Strip, but we'd had enough of that a week earlier. Having said that it's not too hard to get there but don't expect to walk back after that US steak for dinner. If you like shopping there are a couple of malls close by. What really impressed me about this hotel was the breakfast. Not only excellent food and reasonably priced, but the service was friendly and efficient. I was impressed!!</p><br>Room Lamps Not Functional<p>My room was nice but the lighting was a total afterthought. I had two lamps bedside and a desk lamp. All three were mood lamps; not for actual seeing. This statement might sound odd but when you cannot work at the desk due to poor, dim lighting then a hotel change is needed. The mirror in the bathroom had two bar lights on either side but it did not illuminate the middle of the mirror. Shaving worked as long as I moved my head to the left or right side of mirror depending on which side I was shaving.

Used towels were removed the next day but never replaced. Laundry bag never replaced and blanket at foot of bed was thrown over the chair the second day. Housekeeping needs to get it together and the lights should be replaced.

This is the first HIE that did not receive a rating of 4 or 5. I would prefer not to stay here on future business trips and will submit that request to my corporate travel agency.
Room Tip: Not a good property if you'll be working in the evening.
