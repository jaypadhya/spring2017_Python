<html><head><h3>Oasis at Gold Spike Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 3</h3></head><body><br>Unique Hotel<p>Driving to the hotel from the Strip, the neighborhood is a bit sketchy, but the hotel itself is unique. It is bright and dull, noisy and quiet. My room faced towards Freemont, so I had to the keep the blinds closed most of the time. There was no noise from the downstairs music, for which I am grateful. The bed...
More </p><br>Different experience but great!<p>Great location, excellent outdoor area - the best, enjoyed the LOUD outdoor music and live band, everyone there was nice, responsible! Not a place to escape into quietness, but very exciting environment!</p><br>Pretty good little place<p>Great location, room was nice and very clean, however quite loud and hallways smelled a lot like cigarettes! Nice staff, fun pool party! I would return, but I would book a "crash pad" at the motel side of the hotel next time as the tower was quite loud.</p><br>Location was good for my meeting at the D<p>The room 340 was just right for me. It was clean the first day. They do not change your sheets unless u pay. There is no small frig or microwave. Too many dresser drawers . Could not find any ice. Oasis is more like a motel and not a hotel. My room was quiet had a good window view of...
More </p><br>Do not stay here if you plan to sleep<p>This places facilities were nice, the pool was great, the room was clean, cool looking. However, the music is so loud here, literally all day and night, that I would not recommend it to anyone who is looking for more than a place to store your bags. We stayed here two nights and were not able to sleep because the...
More </p><br>Cozy Affordable &amp; Worth It.<p>Room was a bit on the small side however it was clean, renovated and had a comfy bed. For $50 a night what more can you ask for. It's about 2 blocks from Freemont Street & has pool you can bring your own outside food and beverages. I usually stay on the strip and at 4 and 5 star hotels...
More </p><br>Non-traditional and pricey (hidden fees)<p>This facility is not worth price. Difficult to get back in late at night. Noisy. Seedy neighborhood. Staff unprofessional. Their outside courtyard area, between main hotel and pool is fenced and spacious, but i have never seen furniture covered in astroturf-- amazingly dreadful.</p><br>Awesome Experience <p>Photos looked good and reviews were mostly good but somewhat mixed. I was a little unsure what to expect. I have to say I was thoroughly impressed. Having read all the reviews from wait times at check in and parking to noise level and smells, I had none of those issues. Maybe it was beginners luck it being my first...
More </p><br>Quirky and fun<p>We have stayed in many hotels in the Downtown area of Las Vegas and always like to stay in any new ones so Gold Spike was next. We were so glad we stayed and can't believe so many negative reviews we thought it was a great little hotel. We stayed in one of the suites which was on the ground...
More </p><br>Sea change from the rest of the strip<p>This was our first time in Vegas. We did the luxury further down the strip but having read about the Downtown Project thought we'd also spend a couple of nights up here. Don't get me wrong, we love luxury hotels but this was just perfect and we felt really at home at this smaller and more hip venue. The rooms...
