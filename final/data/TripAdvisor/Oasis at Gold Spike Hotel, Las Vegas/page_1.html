<html><head><h3>Oasis at Gold Spike Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 1</h3></head><body><br>Great spot!<p>Lovely property, centrally located minutes from Fremont experience, easy access to Vegas strip. Very clean facility ground well kept. Private elevator for guest, friendly helpful front desk staff. Excellent room decor ,just wished I booked a premier room. The bed was a bit small but other wise, wonderful hotel. Priced right,there's night club but could not hear the music unless walk to lobby. Fun type of property backyard chest game. Definitely will visit again..</p><br>Outdoor oversized games and fun!!<p>While visiting Las Vegas with my husband on a business trip I met up with a high school friend of many years ago who lives out here. She and two friends of hers picked us up at our hotel (the Platinum, I highly recommend it) and took us up to this area. I wanted to do see the Fremont St area and we parked at a garage and started our night here. This place is fantastic and I wish we had something this cool back in NH but alas the weather in NH is quite a bit different here. We stayed for about 2 hours drinking and playing Jenga and chess, they also have a huge beer pong, corn hole and 4 square . It was a great way to start the evening and if I wasn't with my friend we never would have known to come here.
I wish there was a separate Gold Spike Outdoor bar to rate as this review is lumped in with the hotel might not get to the advertising it deserves.</p><br>WAY different than you will expect. FAIR WARNING<p>Honestly I'm so disappointed and a bit frustrated. I really wanted to like this place but instead we were extremely mislead to what this hotel even is, especially the fact that you're above a night club, not the hotel pictured online. The entire place was garbage, the room was awful.

We're young and honestly don't have high standards. We appreciate quirky charm but overall, Really disappointed and wish we could have got our money back to go elsewhere.

I'll start with the positives IF YOU ARE THERE FOR THE NIGHT LIFE: it's actually located above an extremely popular, loud and busy night club, so you get easy access inside compared to the lineup of people outside. It's also very close to Fremont street. Once we were in our room we did not hear the extremely loud music from downstairs, mind you that we were on the top floor.

The negatives: basically everything else. You are not actually staying at the hotel next door, you must go through the outside premises of the night club then through the entire inside of it to get to the elevator. The elevator is totally beat up in bad shape. Once you get to your floor, you'll realize how terrible it smells and how every inch of carpet looks covered in really gross stains. The room was in terrible shape, with green and black mould, someone else's shaving cream & shampoo still all over the walls of the shower, holes in the wall etc. The room was not like the pictures online and wasn't even the type I had booked.</p><br>Can't Beat This Location for Downtown Vegas<p>If you are looking for the conveniences and lavish luxury of Vegas, then this is NOT the hotel for you. It is definitely a dive with a coat of paint - lipstick on a mule as they say. But the room is plenty sufficient. The lobby is LITERALLY the Gold Spike bar, which is a super prominent night spot with lines around the block.

So major upside is you get easy access to awesome nightlife and it's a short walk to Fremont Street, great bars and awesome restaurants. If you don't intent to spend much time in your hotel and aren't looking for a ton of bells and whistles, then this is as good as it gets for downtown Las Vegas.
Room Tip: Great location!

Room Tip: Rooms not facing the "playground" music area could be quieter.

In essence a nightclub with a live band and no end in sight. Despite the free earplugs, my room seemed to be directly over the band and apparently the DJ, so every beat was felt and amplified. It's 4am and it's still going strong. Tomorrow is a very dear friend of mine's wedding and I'll be without sleep and looking like a beaten raccoon with black eyes. Oh, and there are no phones in the room so make sure you have a cell phone and charger because if you have an emergency, good luck! Kids in the hallway, banging on each other's doors...as much as I'd like to join in the falling down drunk, yelling at the top of your lungs, crappy music festivities, some people appreciate a true hotel and not a nightclub labeled as a "hotel".</p><br>Great location - very nice hotel - modern and clean<p>Loved staying here. Just a block away from Freemknt Street. The room are modern and very clean. Only disappointment was their fee for a pet in the room - $50. This is not "pet friendly". We booked on a pet friendly site on line which did not indicate what their fee was - big mistake! Would stay here again - but without a pet!</p><br>Quirky and minimalistic<p>My boyfriend and I stayed here because we did not want to stay on the strip, nor pay the prices. Awesome location considering you can walk to the downtown area. It's close to the old neons and fantastic food and bars! A more low key Vegas experience, but an awesome one for sure! The room was very clean, very minimalistic; there is no refrigerator, water, phones... there is a 7-11 a block away and an ice machine on the floor. It was all you really need out of a hotel room. And, the bar downstairs has a grill next to it, and indoor games. Then the courtyard has outdoor games. Such an interesting concept. We will stay here when we come back.</p><br>Pet friendly<p>The motel is pet friendly, which is why we stayed here. The constant drumming music from Gold Spike next door is nerve-racking going on day and night. There's no ice machine, have to go thru the alley to get ice from the Gold Spike. Not a very safe option. Not much room between bed and dresser and we kept hitting ourselves on the bed legs.
Room Tip: ask for bottom floor

It's very clean and super friendly staff. Oh not to mention I love their little chic pool. The best part about it is that I get to bring my dog with me.</p><br></body></html>
