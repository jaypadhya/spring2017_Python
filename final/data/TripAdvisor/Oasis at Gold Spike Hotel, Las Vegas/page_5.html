<html><head><h3>Oasis at Gold Spike Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 5</h3></head><body><br>Good budget alternative but noisy<p>Only stayed one night in Oasis at Gold Spike on our way from LA to Grand Canyon. We were a little disappointed at first that it was a fair bit from the main strip but I guess we only got ourselves to blame for not doing our research properly. Having said that it’s a good alternative if you’re on a budget. Even though we had a car we took the bus to the strip for $8 return and it was ok, only took about 20 minutes.
The rooms are very comfortable with good wifi, tv, nice beds and clean bathrooms with complimentary toiletries. But it is very noisy at night time due to the night club next door. Luckily we were very jet lagged having arrived from Australia the same day so we would have slept through anything but if you’re not a very heavy sleeper or jet lagged be aware and bring ear plugs or stay up late and join the party people.</p><br>Great Location--Very, VERY clean!<p>Wife and I made a quick stop in Vegas. Wanted to be near downtown/Freemont. WOW! So close...and SUCH A NICE PLACE! The hotel was recently refurbished. Very clean, good and great amenities. Checking in was a BREEZE and the staff were GREAT to point us the right way. We dropped off our things and were on FREMONT STREET in just minutes. Suite was HUGE! Shower big enough for 4! Pool was fantastic with lots of comfy furniture. And did we mention FREE PARKING! THANKS!</p><br>Should have been better<p>This place has a ton of potencial, unfortunately none of it realized. They are under staffed, hard to get your room cleaned and they remodeled the rooms on the cheap. Location is kind of ok, the bar is cool and the resteraunt is ok.

There are way better places to stay in Vegas
Room Tip: Pick a room on the first floor, close to the office.

Location was covenient as also near to Mob Museum which is one of best museums I have been to.Also near to great bar at Atomic Liquor and try The Market for breakfast.Staff were friendly and helpful on reception.
The de luxe room I stayed in was spacious with a nice bathroom and shower although it could use more shelves in bathroom.
The pool looked nice although I did not indulge.
Late at night there was a bit of noise from drunk guests coming back but they soon quietened down or passed out!
No safe in room which was concerning as I had a lap top with me.Also no fridge.
Air con was too loud to use at night you could not sleep.
Main issue was road noise as although they had triple glazed the windows it still came through.Overall hotel had cool retro vibe going on but would suggest they get a second opinion on the sound proofing of windows,replace noisy air con and install safe and fridge and it would improve the hotel rooms significantly.</p><br>Worst ever<p>the only nice thing I can say is it was clean, however the towel did have a stain on it. The ac was ridiculously loud, only stays on for a few minutes then the room gets super hot then it wakes you up again when it comes back on. That is if you were able to fall asleep in the first place, live music til 1 am then dj music and yelling all night! The walls are about as thick as tissue paper. No phone, no clock, no refrigerator. If you just want a cheap place you can sleep when you crash at 5 in the morning then it's great. But if you're a normal person go somewhere else! Oh and a 50$ a day deposit they conveniently didn't tell me about until check in!</p><br>Simply Shocking<p>Probably the worst hotel I've ever set foot in. However it's not surprising at $60 a night, the price of two glasses of wine in NY without tip. The noise is shocking, there is a 2 inch gap at the bottom of my door and I can hear traffic from 3 miles away. Disgusting drunks are throwing up in the beer garden. There is no desk in my room and I'm here on business. My bathroom flooded and room service placed a bunch of towels to soak up the water at 8am. At 8pm when I returned the wet towels were still all over the floor. The in-room food service doesn't exist. They admit its a lie when you call room service. You actually have to go to the dirty bar, pick from the menu and wait for it to be cooked before returning to your room!! The staff are pleasant, but this place is really nasty. If you are homeless however it is an ideal crash pad.
Room Tip: Stay away, its in a nasty neighborhood full of drunks and thugs.

If you can't sleep in a noisy place, this is not for you. Hallways smell like dead something. Rooms are decent but have no phone, no clock, no radio, no television and no mini coffee maker</p><br>Retro, cool spot. Will definitely return.<p>Check in staff was very helpful: I felt that he was an advocate to make my stay better. He asked why we were in town, made sure that we were parked appropriately, suggested a quieter room (further from the night club), and even helped us find a good dinner option. Top notch staff. The pool has a retro, cool vibe as did our room. Our room, was clean and nice, but there was no phone or clock. Not a problem at all since I use my cell phone even if those items are present. The only issue was the AC - it's very loud and turns off and on all night. It worked well, I just kept waking up with the noise. I would stay here again in a heartbeat but bring an ambient noise machine.
Room Tip: specify if you want to be further away from the night club. You'll probably still hear it, but y...

Rooms are nice but totally let down by a total lack of sound insulation and very noisy A/C. You will hear everything going on in the street around you and in the rooms next door (think: drunks, sirens, arguments!). You can get a casino room on the strip for a similar price so why bother.</p><br>Noisy Basic Motel<p>Stayed for two nights, Friday and Saturday. The front desk workers were very nice. The motel is very conveniently located one block away from Fremont street. The room was very basic, but clean. Even though it is a motel you need to use your room key to enter the property. This added security made me feel more comfortable staying here. The problem is the outside noise. There is a large outdoor area behind the motel that is used for parties by this hotel and its sister property the Gold Spike hotel. Each night they turn up the music so load that the floor in my room was vibrating. I know it is Vegas and it's a party town, but the music doesn't stop until 2:30 or 3 in the morning. I would not stay here again.
Room Tip: Away from the back area, but I'm not sure if this would even help with the load noise.
