<html><head><h3>Oasis at Gold Spike Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 8</h3></head><body><br>Coolest Motel I've Ever Been In<p>If you want to come to Vegas but get away from the Strip, this is the spot. Fremont Street Experience and all the bars downtown are really cool, but the Hotels are all outdated and gross. Oasis is a Motel, but it's no Red Roof Inn. The rooms are all newly renovated and they have a great pool. Plus it's located right next to the #1 bar (Gold Spike) in Downtown Las Vegas so it's in a great location. Young couples and singles in their 20's on a budget should for sure check out.</p><br>Awesome pool! Great hotel!<p>The hotel was awesome! Right in the middle of downtown, near a ton of great restaurants, fantastic price, and the staff was very friendly.

Additionally, the rooms were very nice. I was pleasantly surprised on how this boutique hotel lived up to its reviews.

The pool area was super cool, too bad it was December. Definitely coming again!</p><br>I Searched and Searched...<p>I searched and searched and then I found this little gem Downtown.

My wife and I were searching for a Staycation since we are locals and she refused to stay on the strip because she is really into the hipster scene. Also, unfortunately I am not on the best budget due to this economy.

After considering some other places downtown we decided to stay at Oasis based on the price and the pictures that we saw online. This place is AMAZING!!! Low rate, quality staff, awesome vibe at the pool, and cool rooms.... The rooms look to me to be newly renovated and I was very impressed. They look even better than the pictures that we saw online.

LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION... There is so much around the Oasis that there was no reason for us to even use a car during our stay.

The staff was awesome too, I had a very minor issue that needed to be addressed and it was taken care of within 10 minutes.

This is the place to stay downtown.</p><br>Awesome Retreat in Downtown!<p>The Oasis is a fantastic hideaway in Downtown for locals and tourists. It's attached to the Gold Spike, which is by far one of my favorite new bars and it's an easy walk to everything the Downtown project has to offer. I was incredibly impressed with the individuality of each room while maintaining the original integrity of the building; which you don't see often in Las Vegas. The staff, rooms, pool, and accessibility make this a great choice for anyone coming to Vegas that wants a different experience. I can't wait to stay for Life is Beautiful again next year!</p><br>Amazing Downtown Hotel<p>Great hotel for a weekend visit in the downtown area. The rooms were nice, new, and felt very modern. I loved the artwork and decor. It was really easy and convenient to go over to the Gold Spike next door for drinks, food, and live entertainment. I plan on going back the next time I am in Vegas.</p><br>Fantastic spot downtown even for locals<p>Great little spot in the heart of downtown. Next door to one of the cooler bars in town and right in the middle of everywhere you'd want to go.
Once I told the manager on shift that I was actually a local he actually walked me through the property and showed me a few of the rooms. Every room is unique with its own furniture and style. Very cool place. I'll definitely be back!</p><br>Stylish and Convenient Hotel<p>Had an event planned with some work friends at the Gold Spike. I knew it would be a long night out so we decided to book a few rooms at this hotel since it was so close. I was pleasantly surprised by how nice these rooms are! I really appreciated the fact that everything was so clean-lined and modern. During checking in, I actually ran into the general manager of the place, who had informed me that they had just updated the place! He was really nice and seemed like he cared about the property and what I thought of it.

I originally booked for it's convenient location downtown, but will definitely stay again for the friendly staff and great quality of room you get for the amazing price you're paying to stay here!</p><br>Great Experience<p>Really enjoyed my stay, excellent service and atmoshere. I loved the location and the rates seemed very reasonable. The bike rental option was also great for those looking for an alternative mode of transportation. I plan on staying again on my next trip to Vegas.</p><br>Got drunk, didn't want to drive home<p>Had a few too many to drink at the hotel, decided to crash at hotel next door. Turns out this place is legit!!! The lady and I decided to stay another night so we got a suite for the second night. The record player in the suite was a nice touch. Absolutely coming back again. No coffee pots or phones in the room but the friendly staff, awesome rooms, laid back environment and great prices make up for it</p><br>Upscale/Trendy Motel<p>This motel is attached to the Gold Spike complex in downtown Las Vegas. The facility had just opened prior to my stay. My room was small but nice with a comfortable bed, full bathroom with nice walk in shower and a swivel closet. There was a flat screen tv with full local cable and wifi with good connections. The major drawback was that it is a motel, so soundproofing isn't great (no hallway, so I could hear people walking by outside). There were also a few hiccups that need to be ironed and precluded me from giving a 4 rating (staff confusion regarding check-in location, more confusion regarding the restaurant carry out process and the fitness room not yet being open). That being said, the front desk staff was very friendly.

There is a nice looking pool with a small waterfall and a snack shop. The location is good, with many dining choices nearby and one block from Fremont Street.</p><br></body></html>
