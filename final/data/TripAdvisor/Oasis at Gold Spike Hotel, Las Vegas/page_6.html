<html><head><h3>Oasis at Gold Spike Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 6</h3></head><body><br>No real reason to give less than 5 stars<p>New, clean, unique decor ideas, fun, good rates, outdoor rooms are better than the Gold spikes interior rooms .If your staying here, call in some friends because there's lots to do (games, pool, ect)

Ok the check-in was a little complicated and its an old motel building frame so you do get some noise, but anyone who leaves less then 3 starts better have a very good reason, because these people are doing a lot of things right. (especially for downtown's standards)</p><br>Love downtown Vegas<p>Great time at Fremont experience, people, zip line, casinos and food was great. Hotel was perfect for us and staff very helpful (especially Elliott) Would highly recommend. We used the hotel as a base for our activities such as 24 hour bus travel for one price, and a Grand Canyon tour.</p><br>Very fun place to stay, a couple hiccups<p>Stayed here on Feb 8th (Sunday) in one of the ultimate crash pads (room 233 iirc). I really liked the whole setup. The room was done up really well and even had a Crosley LP player with records you could borrow from the main office. The Gold Spike and backyard was really different (in a good way) and had a pretty good crowd for a Sunday night.

There were 2 AC units for the room - one wouldn't turn on and the other just blew hot air. They sent up someone from maintenance at 10 pm who took out the filter (it was black) to clean and told me the electrician they hired messed up that's why some units wouldn't turn on. He couldn't recharge the unit and said it would have to wait. The other point is the door needs a new door sweep - there was a gap under the door around 2-3 inches open directly to the outside.

The pool was really nice too although not heated, it felt great on the legs after a 3 hour hike up Frenchman mountain. If I was staying downtown I'd stay here again but in a room with working AC.
Room Tip: Spring for the upgrade to the ultimate crash pad and try for something on the 3rd floor.

I was on the third floor of the Oasis motel portion (although I know some rooms are available at the Goldspike tower). The food in the bar is decent, the servers are super friendly. Overall, I can't wait to return here! HOWEVER.....

If you're a light sleeper, or aren't necessarily in Vegas to party, this Hotel might not be the right fit for you. During the week, it's generally fine (with the exception of loud traffic.) The weekend was a much different story -- the Goldspike bar has a club night on Friday and Saturday nights and the bass can be heard quite well in the rooms. The streets are super loud with partiers, and if you have a loud neighbor, you will hear everything (especially if they're partying on the balconies all night :/ ) I wore earplugs, and had an okay sleep, on and off. That is my only complaint about the hotel. Otherwise, highly, highly recommended.</p><br>NEVER AGAIN!<p>Pros:
-Clean

Cons:
-Unfriendly service. Come on people; SMILE! You’re in the tourist industry!
-Extremely loud (including A/C). Be sure to bring good ear plugs!
-Very small.
-No microwave or fridge
-Bathroom door doesn’t close. You can hear EVERYTHING that’s going on in the bathroom 
-Not sure why they charge a “resort fee”! This was definitely NOT a resort! I would stay home in freezing Canada before staying there again.</p><br>Ice Machines Where Art Thou?<p>I spent Feb21-Feb24th at the Oasis..I am an Old Gold Spike Guest and was happy to see they were up and running again. Andrea and Elliott who worked the Front Desk were Polite Professional and Accomodating to all my request. Need a Lightbulb. New KeyCard. My room Fantastic Clean and Confortable. The Grill still serves up those Great Cobb Salads I enjoy so much. I did not miss the Slots as my love of Monopoly Board Game Trumps Slots anyday for me. However I just would like to know why there are no Ice Machines near the Rooms..even in the main building when it was open you had to catch the elevator and Schleep Ice Bucket to the Bar.Now you must leave the Oasis n walk over to main building Schleeping an Ice Bucket..it rained Sunday and yes I was Wet as The Dang Ice.. LoL. My suggestion would be to put a Ice Machine down by the Pool Area.. I love the New Boutique Hotel and wil be returning soon and will recommed it to my friends.</p><br>Great new trendy spot in downtown!<p>Spending our first night downtown, this hotel could not have been more perfect! The rooms were extremely clean and well furnished, the pool was pristine, and the attached bar felt straight out of New York City, a welcome respite from the hustle and bustle of the casinos, which were a short walk away. For the price, I could not recommend a better hotel or attached bar. I definitely can't wait to go back!</p><br>Great place to stay<p>Hotel room was very clean and the staff friendly/helpful.
Room was pretty big with a modern-looking bathroom
Trendy looking spot with a retro pool and lounge chairs.
Great location in downtown Vegas very walkable to Fremont.</p><br>Great spot in down town vegas<p>Stayed there for a night just to get to know down town and get away from the strip. Great room with excellent finishings. Found it super convenient to walk around and see the new down town spots. Highly recommend it for anyone who is looking to get out of the vegas strip scene</p><br>Awesome rooms in the heart of the new downtown!<p>Went with 6 friends for a 3-night weekend. I've spent some time downtown and wanted to show my friends how awesome it was. It took a little bit of convincing, but they all agreed to spend our first night downtown at the Oasis. It was awesome! For the price, you can't beat this hotel. Full stop. Goldspike was fun, the rooms were clean, and each one was unique! We had an awesome time Downtown and will surely stay here again!</p><br></body></html>
