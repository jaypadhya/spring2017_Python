<html><head><h3>Oasis at Gold Spike Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 7</h3></head><body><br>great<p>has just about everything you could ask for ,great food and cheap drinks...lots of fun with full size games.live bands on the weekends,fire to keep you warm as well as heaters above. Tons of fun anyone can enjoy</p><br>Mixed Bag - Not for Everyone<p>You have to be able to enjoy or don't mind party atmosphere/loud music for this one. The not so good: on weekends very loud music from nightclub at first floor of Gold Spike and party outside of hotel, internet not greatest, and no alarm. The good: service, if you want to continue a party atmosphere then the not so good becomes great (two parties on first floor going on at the same time, one inside, one outside). The great: party atmosphere, the rooms are ok, clean restroom,
nice lcd tv, close/convenient to fremont casinos.
Room Tip: Muffle music with tv and ac. Get to room late at night, you'll sleep better.

A little noise from the street and other guests but nothing unexpected for Vegas. Cute pool area. Coffee at the Gold Spike is $4, but refills are free. There was some confusion as to whether the Gold Spike does room service - the staff at the restaurant refused it despite the front desk telling us that they did provide it. Great location for walking to both Fremont Street and the Container Park. Secure with 2 locking gates and lots of staff around. Fast, free wifi. We had no problems at all with parking, but we were there in off season. Not the best hotel room I have ever had, but the best one I have ever had for the price we paid.
Room Tip: windows facing Las Vegas Blvd are louder, the "crash pad" rooms do not have TVs. No coffee...

Beds are comfortable furnishing are spars and modern. Had a little hesitation from reading a few reviews but I called and staff assured me of my concerns. No night club on week nights, TV's in all room type but Deluxe (their lowest rated rooms) and restaurant open 24hr. Look, this is no Four Seasons and they may want to put TV's in all rooms but NO polyester bed spread or matted nappy carpet! They have a very fun young crowd vibe and you should read reviews for Golden Spike on yelp for more info on property. Keep in mind all the downtown hotels have more street noise than on strip and this hotel is only a few stories high...I'm a light sleeper so I got ear plugs. Overall a very good value.</p><br>A potentially horrible experience turned good.<p>I booked my room through Hotwire and this hotel was rated a 3 star I thought I was going to check in can to the D or Plaza, or Fremont or 4 Queens. Upon checking in I was told the rooms only had one queen size bed and no television. I had two of my kids with me, both are minors so I knew that there would be plenty of time being spent in the room. I complained to the manager that I was not aware that the rooms have no television - Hotwire did not specify that. I was ready to eat the cost of my reservation and go look for another hotel, David the manager was very kind and upgraded my room to a suite, which had a 60 inch TV, and at no additional cost. The music in the patio area was extremely loud and hard to get some sleep (til 3AM), however next time I check into this place I will make sure that I don't come with my minor children, instead I will bring my girlfriend and have a great time in the patio with live music and DJ. If you're coming out with your friends and you are in your twenties early thirties this is a great place to stay and hang out and have a great time.</p><br>Great Choice for Downtown<p>I stayed at this property recently. I loved its location - easy access and within walking distance of both the "classic" Las Vegas downtown and the "hip" new Las Vegas downtown. The staff was very friendly and helpful and seemingly very concerned with my satisfaction. THe room was fine...very comfortable bed, good TV and large, if a little sparse, bathroom. The pool looked so inviting I am looking forward to returning in warmer weather. Main complaint was the noise outside my room. I made the mistake to get a room by the elevator. I had arrived very late and the hotel was sold out. They were anxious and willing to move me but I guess I was both too busy and too lazy to do so. In any event, the manager said they are working on this. I should note that the "lobby" has a nice big table to work at and wifi was terrific all around the property. I would like to have been able to get a "gourmet" coffee in the lobby but Starbucks was just a few blocks away. There is no valet parking but there is security on duty all night and valet can be had right across the street for free if you get something to eat or spend some time in their casino. I have begun to select downtown over the strip lately. I do miss the luxury of some of the strip hotels but I love the vibe of downtown so I will definitely return to this "boutique" property. Given the attitude of management and staff, I am confident it will get better and better!</p><br>Hmm, where to begin...<p>I read great things about this place. I even cancelled other reservations to change to here. I've been to other cool 50s motels transformed into hip hotels, Valley Ho in Scottsdale, for example. This was cheaper and smaller. I actually like downtown, but I enjoy the luxury of the strip too.

The good: prices are great. If you literally are looking for a "crash pad" as they name the rooms, you can't go wrong. Cheap and good. Walking distance to the Container Park, Kerry Simon's newest restaurant, art, bars, etc. Everything is newer. Pay the upgrade and get a suite. For $20ish more per night, you'll get walk in closets, turntables in rooms, and twice the space.

The bad: the bones are a 50s motel. Same layout and structure means you WILL hear everyone in the pool, walking by, or cars down the nearest major street. There aren't many rooms, so if there is a problem, they probably can't change your room. Check in took an extreme amount of time. 6 people took 45 minutes, no joke. The cleaning staff misses things. My room had the soap out from the last guest, a stack of shampoo on the counter for no reason, and an empty piece of luggage left in the closet. My friends room wasn't touched one day when it needed cleaning. The final morning, I had their "do not disturb" tag on the door, which are pretty clever, but was still awakened at 8:30am by someone banging on the door yelling "housekeeping". I answered and asked if they missed the obvious sign on the door and he said he thought I checked out.

Bottom line: the place is cool. I love that it is revamped and connected to some hip places. But this place makes some amateur mistakes. They could be easily fixed, but I am not convinced the staff is truly motivated to make the next step. I saw one guy in the office almost every time I was walking thru. He never could be broken away from his laptop until he realized there were problems. Maybe if he looked up every once in a while, he could help direct some improvement. It will never be 5 star, but it's not supposed to be. It could still be top rated if they figure their way around it.</p><br>Nothing Fancy But Very Nice!!!!<p>My husband and I visited Vegas Jan 2nd through the 4th. We stayed in the Ultimate Crash Pad ( the larger suite) very nice and basic. For the price I think this is a steal, really enjoyed my stay!

Pros:
The bathrooms were clean
front desk staff was great checking in and out very smoothly
let you put your deposit down in cash ( if you don’t want a hold)
were able to print out our boarding passes
Gated Parking lot with security
Small property (no crowds)
2 blocks away from the Casino Center (clubs, casino, and lots of food)
On the bus line
Food was good at the Oasis Grill ( gave us coupons for 3.00 off at check-in)

Cons:
We had a dining room table in the middle of the room instead of a couch that’s was pictured
no rugs or carpet
Small parking lot
Wood floors so we could hear heels walking across the floor.

*Just a tip there is a club on the property called The Back Yard its nice, BUT YOU WILL HEAR THE MUSIC ALL NIGHT LONG. There is also a secure gate that separated the club and the hotel, so no random people wondering around our rooms.</p><br>Sweet boutique hotel<p>Great hidden gem in Old Vegas! The price incredible! We found the room to be super chic and clean! Staff was knowledgeable and friendly! My only complaint is that our room was strongly scented...like an Abercrombie and Fitch store. Otherwise it was perfect!! Highly recommend, will definitely stay here again...oh and the bed is amazingly comfortable!!</p><br>If you're ok with no amenities, this is a great hotel<p>I made the mistake of not thoroughly researching this hotel. I saw the location and the price and booked. While it's newly renovated, very close to all the action on Fremont Street and walking distance to all the new startups in the Downtown Project, be prepared that is not a typical boutique hotel. There's no in-room television, radio, clock, telephone or even a plastic cup in the bathroom. You can't schedule a wake-up call. You must rely on your own phone to call the front desk. (If you don't bring your cell phone or lose your charge, you are at a disadvantage. I felt that was also a security issue. What if something happens and you NEED the front desk ASAP?) The wifi didn't work well in our room and we had to talk to the front desk about it. They didn't know how to resolve the issue until the next working day. The lounge near the bar is not only horrifically loud, but is a dark space that also smells of some kind of air freshener or some scented something that can really be overwhelming. Thus, I would not recommend this to anyone who has business with nearby Zappos or any of the startups just down the street. It's just not conducive for getting work done after meetings and you have to go somewhere else. However, as a 20-something "crash pad" where you may only need a decent shower and bed, this is a dream come true for the price. One other note: while the room was pretty clean, there was a big wad of gum stuck to the radiator in my room. During my stay, no service came to clean (you don't even have the hang tag on the door to request it). Additionally, when I first arrived, the lights did not work. The maintenance guys arrived only to proclaim, "wow, this is like a prison cell." Yeah…not the greatest start to a week-long stay when the walls of the room are dark and the lights don't even work well enough to read the complimentary newspaper. While the fix was done rather quickly, it set the tone for the rest of the week and I never felt it to be a great home away from home during this business trip.</p><br></body></html>
