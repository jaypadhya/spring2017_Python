<html><head><h3>Oasis at Gold Spike Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 4</h3></head><body><br>My stay at oasis!<p>my stay here at oasis was very eventful. Not in a good way. I say this because there was so many obstacles that my fiancé and had to cross into getting things right. To start off my fiancé and I were visiting Vegas for a high school reunion. We stayed in the month of June and wanted to stay somewhere cheap but still a good time! We heard so many good reviews for this place and decided to give it a try. Upon to checking in we had to wait 2 hours before we could settle in our room because the room was not ready! After the allotted time was maxed we finally got to check in. We we're definitely blind sided about the hotel resor fee which was an EXTRA $250. After checking into our room we saw all of the games and cool decor that was promised on the website so we were excited. After arriving in our room we saw a couple of things that were flawed. Our dead bolt was broken so we couldn't lock the door and the ice machine was not on either floors so my fiancé had to play scavenger hunt for the machin and come to find out it was in the hotels kitchen. Once we came out to party our hotel turned into the hottest club in downtown which was really hype. But coming back to sleep was a nightmare due to the fact that there was no parking for the HOTEL GUESTS!! My fiancé and I had to spend a hour finding parking and the next morning we got a warning ticket on our car! Housekeeping was good but the three away what ever "looked" like trash. We had department store bags that had small items in there which was Tshirts and some cologne but they got thrown away so we had to buy more. Overall my stay here at this hotel was not that pleasant due to the ice machine and parking but the workers besides the front desk were very nice to us and made us feel like we were home. Thank you for taking the time to read my review. Hope this will help you decide on which hotel to stay at your next visit to Vegas!!</p><br>Terrible smell!!!<p>I checked into this place and checked right out! The check in room smelled like mold! The guy at the front desk was very slow and had attitude! The pool is right in front of the rooms so you could hear a bunch of kids screaming in the pool. I got my room key and get too my room and it had a foul smell like the check in room! I wanted to throw up it smelled so bad. The room upstairs had so much noise felt like roof was about to cave in like it was made out of cardboard! I could still hear all the kids screaming in the pool I was getting a headache because I just wanted to rest, and the foul odor of mold in the room. I was in the room about 5 minutes and I had to go to front desk to get a refund. The worst smelling hotel ever! You couldn't pay me to stay at this hotel! Tony S pretty much put lipstick on a pig. He is very cheap! Don't waste your time staying here! U can stay at the Grand next door for the same price, way better hotel. I wouldn't recommend this hotel to anybody...</p><br>Good effort to remodel, but avoid<p>I booked this through hotwire and selected that I needed two beds, the hotel apparently has no rooms with two beds.

This is an old building that has been renovated to appear modern and chic trying to pass itself off as a boutique hotel. Things have been cheaply redone and the furniture looks like Ikea but I am sure real Ikea furniture is nicer.

The bathrooms are super small, and very little water pressure. There are no courtesy cups in the room for water or anything you might bring in. The shower curtain isn't big enough to cover the tub, so you might end up with water on the floor and there is no shower mat to step out on so your floor ends up wet and slippery.

The WiFi is really slow, when trying to load emails it kept buffering.

We couldn't find a phone in the room to call the front desk when we needed something, you have to dial the front desk with the cell phone you brought (which is fine, when they answer the phone). I have still at this point been trying to reach them on the phone, after check out and you get voicemail.

I was unaware of a convention going on in vegas this week, but it seemed the party started and ended at this hotel. They had a band, and dj set up behind the hotel and it rocked on until around 3am. So loud that on the 5th floor you could feel the music in your room. The complementary ear plugs left in our room were not enough. I only stayed around 6 hours at the hotel and couldn't wait to leave and spend the rest of my time at the airport.</p><br>Best of Vegas<p>If you want a perfect hotel in Vegas then this is it. It's my 5th time in Vegas and the most enjoyable. I've stayed in big hotels on the strip but this was the most relaxing after a Veges day.The staff are pleasant and helpful, the rooms are immaculate and spacious. The shower is so big you could get lost. It's a 2 minute walk to the Freemont Street Experience which is fantastic and a 5 minute taxi to the strip or a 30 minute walk. The pool is excellent. The only thing missing in the room is a fridge.</p><br>Ok for a quick over night<p>We showed up at this hotel fairly late, the shuttle dropped us off clear on the otherside and had to lug all our luggage around the block, tried to get checked in but the key maker machine kept fouling up, took about 20 minutes or more to get checked in a key to our room. The room was fairly small, so small infact I kept racking my knee on the corners of the beds when I'd get up to go into the bathroom. The decor was nice and overall felt comfortable. One block from Fremont so it was a nice short walk to entertainment. Would stay here again in a pinch but not for long term.</p><br>No Clockwork no FUN<p>This use to be a great place to go and play and have fun with great music! It is off the beaten path but was worth the trip to see a great band and have some fun! This casino and hotel have given up their best asset by not bringing Clockwork back for the summer. The rooms are not great and the only thing worth going here for is when they have a great band! The service is excellent but regretfully since this is a young crowd they make hardly any tips So if you do go make sure and tip these great people! Sad the owner Tony Hsieh"s is to cheap to bring back great bands! I went to this venue 5 times last time I was in Vegas! Spent lots of money on booze and tips so now they have lost a good customer who spends money! Their loss till Clockwork comes back!!</p><br>Wonderful place to stay!<p>I am a local to Vegas and my husband and I decided to vacation in Vegas. So glad that we chose to stay at Oasis at Gold Spike. We found it to be friendly, clean and close to alot of wonderful hidden treasures in the downtown area. We didn't get in our vehicle once the whole weekend. Everything you need is in walking distance.
The room was clean and the service was awesome.</p><br>Excellent hotel, great service and an outstanding location!<p>I was pleasantly surprised with the hotel and room I received, along with the overall concept of the hotel. I really liked the room, and the extra touches provided (see my picture). The room looked to be recently remodeled and was very clean. The bathroom amenities were a plus along with the hot shower! You can't beat the location, with the hotel being just a couple of blocks from Fremont Street. The staff was very friendly and accommodating for me, especially Angel when I was checking in. I will definitely return to this hotel in the future.
Room Tip: 3rd floor rooms tend to be a little more quieter. I had a great view of the pool.

Also the water in the pool was extremely cold.</p><br>Downtown Gem<p>Well the staff was inviting. I actually arrived early and was able to hang by the pool for a few hours. Gold Strike is Vintage and walking distance to Fremont East, Arts District and Mob Museum. Considering all the fun around me the noise level was very low. I noticed many couples walking around. Outside games are so much fun! People are playing toss and house shoes. I will be back!!!
Room Tip: Get a room by the pool...
