<html><head><h3>Oasis at Gold Spike Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 2</h3></head><body><br>Cool, super-clean boutique hotel in Fremont district -- friendly staff, excellent stay!<p>For my recent four-night Las Vegas trip, I wanted to stay someplace other than the Strip -- and I'm definitely glad I found Oasis at Gold Spike.

Located on North Las Vegas Boulevard, Oasis isn't a big, casino-type hotel... which is EXACTLY what I wanted. It's a nicely refurbished, old-school, three-floor building with room doors facing the pool area. The staff is VERY friendly, and the facilities are extremely well-maintained. Oasis has a very laid-back, cool vibe, in part because of the property's small size. With only about 40 guest rooms (each uniquely decorated, apparently), the hotel has an "indie" character rather than the artificial, commercial feel of the mega-hotels downtown. Adding to Oasis' warmth and uniqueness are the personable front-desk and housekeeping staff... you can tell they like what they're doing and genuinely care about quality service.

Convenient location is probably one of Oasis' best assets. Literally across the street from the Fremont Street Experience (the preferred nightlife destination for 20- and 30-somethings) and connected through a shared courtyard to Gold Spike (a cool bar/club/restaurant), you're just steps away from the local party scene. On weekends, the area can get a little rowdy... so Oasis thoughtfully provides earplugs for guests in case noise levels get a little too high at night.

Just a five-minute walk from the hotel is a Deuce bus stop -- the round-the-clock, double-decker buses that shuttle people up and down the Strip. So getting to the big casinos, downtown restaurants or shows isn't difficult. But it's nice to stay in a more laid-back, chill area of town and venture into the glitziness of the Strip at will.

As for the hotel rooms themselves, CLEAN is the best one-word description. Nice, modern furnishings and fixtures. Large, wall-mounted flat-screen TV. Comfy bed and linens. Window A/C unit. Overall, the rooms are simple, but attractive and comfortable. And clean.... ;-)

The pool/lounge area is very nice; the equipment is well-maintained and pool towels are provided. I spent afternoons taking in a little desert sun and cooling down in the pool's refreshing waters.

The only warning I'd give potential guests is to be aware that Oasis, like many Las Vegas hotels, adds a $20/day "resort fee" to the basic room price. This seems to be a trend in Vegas as a way to look better in online price comparisons. But really, you're going to pay an extra 20 bucks per day than the advertised booking price. As long as you're aware of this, though, Oasis can still be a great deal compared with other Vegas hotels. And Oasis certainly has more character!

All in all, I'd highly recommend Oasis, and I myself will gladly return. It's a quaint, conveniently located hotel with a relaxed and friendly feel. If you're looking for something different from touristy Las Vegas casino hotels, this might be the "Oasis" for you! ;-)</p><br>Great lil motel<p>Awesome place to stay during the week (I heard weekends are really loud) this is not a huge casino hotel, it is a cute clean quaint motel! Bed was comfortable, room was clean, I felt perfectly safe there and I was alone the first night! The back gate opens into the courtyard of the club where there is a game area set up and a outside bar, staff was super friendly. ....would definately stay here again!</p><br>NICE &amp; CLEAN AND CONVENIENT<p>I have only been to Las Vegas a few times for pleasure. This time it was in and out the next day on business. Time was tight so I searched my arrival area and my meeting area the next morning. This property came up. The price was right....until I saw a $20 resort fee added. How nice to be able to advertise an inexpensive rate and bump it up later. This reminds me of buying a pound of coffee beans in a supermarket. Say the beans were $6.50 Lb. Nice, right? But the can is comes in costs $3.50. Ugh. I arrived at 9pm and checked out at 7:30AM. What is the resort fee business? The pool was closed for chemical treatment. There was no phone in the room. I didn't need a phone nor the pool. The parking lot was full as the night club was packed with older teens and folks in their 20s. No problems with the blasting music in the room! I had no idea that a guest could use the lot across the street by hanging a parking pass on the rear view mirror until I asked if there were alternate parking spaces.

Check out was easy. The location was just 2 miles from where I had to be, which was super. Overall, I would say the place is nice. The bed was oh so comfortable so I had a good, albeit short, night's sleep. But these resort fees need to go. Build it into the room rate. I know why they don't. They'll show up as a higher rate. Without the resort fee being built in, they can whop you upon check in and check out. Now...should we bring a can the next time we go to the supermarket?
Room Tip: the tower gives you a quiet night's sleep.

Recently remodeled with modern/vintage look. Nice pool. Backyard are (between hotel and Gold Spike Casino) was really cool. Live music, outdoor bars, games, etc. on weekends. Rooms are very small, but then how much time will you spend in it. I rented a suite, which was very large. My only complaint (downgrade from 4) is they need to teach housekeeping to clean bathrooms. Hair on floor, bath mat and in shower. Others have complained about the same. If they'd clean this up, I'd stay there again.
Room Tip: Noisy due to location. Higher floor will be quitter.
See more room tips</p><br>Good location, easy parking,but small rooms.<p>After staying at the other hotels near Fremont street we were disappointed. Very small rooms, noisy between floors and not as clean as it could be. No coffee machines or fridge in rooms, although they gave vouchers for 2 coffees from bar. Very nice pool area with a nice variety of seating and water fountains/falls to drown out traffic sounds. Great WiFi and friendly staff. Motel style with dirty unwashed concrete walkways. AC and lge flatscreens. Will probably book elsewhere for price. Possible additional charges for small pet really meant 25.00 per night. Outrageous.</p><br>Decent facility, very poorly cleaned, and loud.<p>We choose this hotel due to its reviews on here, and were unimpressed.

Starting off was the check-in process. The main lot, including the guest registration spots were completely full, making it both confusing and very difficult to check-in. Further, in order to check in to begin with, you must go up to what looks like a pool gate, and ring a doorbell, making the whole experience uninviting and cumbersome.

While the hotel itself is as you'd expect for a 3 star hotel, the cleaning was almost nonexistent. There was dark curly hair in all corners of the room, but most visible on the lighter colored tile in the bathroom. There were black smudges in a couple of our towels. And there was a dirty washcloth hanging on the shower curtain rod.

Sleeping was a whole different issue. Initially, I felt the provided earplugs were thoughtful, until the loud music started blasting from the patio below from midnight until 3:30am. I then realized they were both necessary, but inadequate in cutting out the noise. Also, only one set was provided.

I'm completely unsatisfied with the Oasis at Gold Spike. Especially, with their mentality that their bar customers should take precedence over their sleeping customers.</p><br>Off the strip<p>Upon entering the room there was earplugs on the night stand, which said a lot!
No coffee marker, alarm clock or phone to call the front desk..
We stayed on the 5th floor, and the hall smelled of something moldy or of a dirty laundromat and the carpet down the hall looked very stained blackish but I think that was the color of the carpet..
There's a small bar on location along with a small cafe!

The back lot is a play ground for adults at night with a band and adult games, if your into that scene, which is why they have earplugs by the bed.
The bed was comfy, room was clean but floor had not been clean, other peoples hair in the bathroom..

It's off the strip by one block and the end of Fremont St.
Walking back after dark could have been scary if I hadn't had my husband with me!</p><br>A nice gem in the less touristic part of Vegas<p>Stayed in the hotel for one night in order to be close to Gay Pride. Staff was friendly, room was very cool and much different than what I expected it to be.
Had a record machine in the room with a nice selection of 70's music records which really added to the atmoshpere</p><br>A Different kind of Vegas experience<p>Overall this hotel was solid! Loved that it offered a different kind of Vegas experience. More of a downtown off the strip kind of trip which I much prefer. Lots of bars, restaurants, and downtown scene is just steps away. My only complaint was the noise however I was there for a weekend wedding and our crew took over the hotel and was ready to party to the full extent over the Labor Day weekend. My room was also next to the elevator which likely didn't help the noise level. The a/c does help block out the noise level FYI. They do also provide complimentary sets of ear plus in branded custom cases which was a nice touch.
Room Tip: Stay away from any room by the elevator! You've been warned.

Attraction restaurants like Heart Attack Grill, the Giant Pint, plus all the others new bars/restos/lounges/clubs thanks to the DowntownProject by Tony Hsieh or other revitalizations realised by Derek and Greg Stevens. But you can also stroll the more historic downtown, like the Vegas fort, Mob museum, Neons boneyard... Shoppingwise, the Las Vegas North premium outlet (lot better than the airport one) or the Container Park on Ftremont are perfect.
And when you want to go on the south part of the strip just hop on the Deuce or the SDX in front the hotel ($3 simple fare, $8 daypass valid for 24h)

Now for the hotel : it recently changed owner, so most of the hotel is newly renovated, but there are still some ongoing renovations. The casino was transformed into a nice lounge with outdoor patio which attract a young urban crowd every night.
The grill offers a simple and nice menu with decent prices (big and delicious Breakfast101 will keep you full until a late lunch)
The very attractive rooms and room rates make this hotel and its lounge a downtown favorite, busy at night and packed every weekend... but very calm during weekdays.
As for the rest the pool is very nice, quite from Monday to Thursday, and more animated when comes Friday (pool parties on saturdays)
The staff, young and friendly, still lacks experience but always tries his best to satisfy.

4 cons during our stay :
- No full mirror in our room (#501) very unpractical in a city where we are going out every night
- No ice machine on room floors (one has to walk down with his ice bucket to the bar or grill) very unpractical to keep fresh beverages before heading under the Vegas heat
- No fitted sheet (I understand that it is more practical to strip the bed, but one king sheet per queen beds would be nice as it could be tucked under the matress which a normal queen size sheet doesn't allow)
- When we checked in, the room was tidy but not really clean (armchair stained, dust on frame-tops and under the bed, hair on bathroom and bedroom floor) nothing that we couldnt manage ourself in an hour with a few alcohol wipes and elbow grease but it was so flagrant and basic that it begs the question : is there any room inspection happening prior to guest check-in ?

A few minor inconveniences but still a great overall experience in a young beautiful hotel, perfectly located. Nice people, nice parties, nice food, nice room.. We'll be back !
Room Tip: Quietest rooms are on the top floors of the tower
