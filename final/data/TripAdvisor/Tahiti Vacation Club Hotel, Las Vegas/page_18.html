<html><head><h3>Tahiti Vacation Club Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 18</h3></head><body><br>Big Spacious Suite at a Great Price<p>My girlfriend and I only stayed at the Tahiti vacation club for one night, but we were very impressed with the size and cleanliness of the suites. The grounds were clean and the swimming area was large and impressive. The price was exceptionally good.</p><br>Staff great, nice pool, convenient shuttle service, enjoyed the stay<p>This is a timeshare where there are large units with multiple bedrooms. However, we had the “lock-off” (as they say in timeshare parlance) hotel-style studio room. Overall I was happy with our stay, although the building/paint is a bit drab, and the place is definitely for those who don’t need to be walking distance to the action and excitement of the strip.

There was an hourly free shuttle to the strip, also one on certain days to the grocery store (we didn’t use it), a free shuttle to the Fremont Street Experience Thursday night which we did take, and a nice bus tour of the Red Rock Canyon which was only $5 for the park entry fee, also on Thursdays (leaves at 8 am). There were 4 stops in the park, the visitor center was extensive and very well done, and there was just enough time to take a short walk and pictures at the other stops. It was 107 degrees out so I certainly didn’t miss not being able to actually hike around! The shuttle drivers were all very nice. (Be sure to make reservations for everything but the strip shuttle, to guarantee a seat.)

The two pools were attractive, with sand in the shallow area where people would put beach chairs. There was shade available under thatched roof huts, and plenty of lounge chairs and tables. The pool was open 24 hours a day which was great. I bought a pool float at the CVS next door and was floating on the pool at 9 pm!

The breakfast was minimal but OK – coffee, juice, bagels, cream cheese, and packaged Danish. There’s a Denny’s and a Starbucks right next door if this isn’t enough. Or buy food and keep it in your room for breakfast. Even our studio had a kitchen area with a fridge, sink, microwave, and cupboards with supplies including plates, cups, bowls, silverware, etc.

Although I thought that the stairs to the second floor could have used vacuuming, and a hallway door handle came off in my husband’s hand, the place seemed sufficiently clean and maintained to me. No bad smells, even though this is obviously an older property. There is free wifi in the (attractive) lobby, free DVD rentals, a small store with hats, sunblock, snacks, and some frozen meals, and the front desk staff was extremely friendly. I’m sure if you had one of the larger rooms this would be a great place for families. We were only there 3 nights but enjoyed our stay very much.</p><br>Wonderful spacious rooms, great location<p>This resort is off the strip, but is in a great location and close walking proximity to stores& places to eat. It offers a great free shuttle service to and from major hotels on the strip. They also offer shuttles to the supermarket and other areas, so that you have the conveinence of resort living in a spacious and wonderful setting. You can sleep more then 6 in many of the 2 bedroom/2 bath units. The staff is very nice and friendly and quite accomodating. If you are so inclined, you can rent a car (and park it at the resort) for some of the day trips you may want to take to surrounding areas. The conceirge will help you plan trips, assist with rentals, cabs and shows. Very enjoyable- great for families.</p><br>Great Place to Stay:)<p>My husband and I stayed here Aug 15-22 and we had such a nice time. The staff were very friendly and helpful. Every time we phoned the front desk for anything (towel exchange, soap etc.) we were served within minutes. We stayed in an efficiency which was nice. The one bedroom suites are much better if you like to cook for your self in staed of going out to eat:) There is a Denny's next door, a CVS, starbucks, Wing Stop and Papa Johns close by as well. There is also a liquor store about 1/2 mile away on Decatur st. Shuttles run ever hour and drop you off at the New York New York. You can also shuttle hop to other Casinos as well. We will definitely come back to Tahiti! Good Job Tahiti!!
Room Tip: We took 115A which was close to vending and the exit to the pool area.

We stayed there 7/4-11, and everything we needed was done no problem!! I was there with my Mom and my nephew, the entire staff totally surpassed our expectations, "Our wish was their command." This is actually rare at any hotel property anywhere in the world. The Tahiti totally impresses me everytime I stay there. Stephanie Ford the Assistant GM, helped us out tremendously in our time of need, and Michael the night auditor was very helpful and very friendly. Furthermore, everyone from the maintenance guys to housekeeping exceeded our expectations. The pool is TRANQUIL, and inviting-I LOVED IT!!! If I want to have another type of pool experience I will go to the Mandalay Bay hotel, however, the rooms were beautiful, the beds were SUPER COMFY, everything looked like new, VERY CLEAN, and everything was certainly up to par. I highly recommend this property-it's fun, relaxing, and a wonderful family environment!!! MERCI BEAUCOUP to everyone there "-"
Room Tip: We are vacation owners...

Staff was very friendly. Breakfast was nothing to look forward to; you'd be better off bringing your own breakfast items or going out to eat. At check-in I was told that the resort was going to hold $100 off my card duing the stay and upon check-out the charge would be reversed. I just happen to look at my bank account today and noticed that I was charged $100 on my account (I checked-out 3 days ago). I was told by my bank to wait one more day and if it is not dropped then my bank is going to have to dispute the charge. Make sure you get something in writing upon check out that your fee will be dropped.</p><br>Pretty damn good .....<p>well we got a chance to use a family member's time share at this location and it was much nicer than we expected .... not a casino location but a decent place with a couple of nice pools .. staff very nice ... clean place .... convenient shuttle to the strip ... we will return if given the opportunity</p><br>Great stay, we will be back!<p>We stayed here in July for a week and it was great! I am assuming the previous reviewer (Vonners81) stayed at another hotel because that review is way off and we stayed there at about the same time. The hotel was clean, room was kept up great, we did not see one bee out at the pool the entire week we were there! We had an excellent vacation while staying here! We were on the top 3rd floor over looking the pools and had an excellent view on our balcony! The kitchen is nice and is a decent size, it had granite counter tops, and all the amenities you would need to cook.; from pots, pans, toaster, spatulas, pot holders, to all the dishes and utensils. The master bath is pretty big, has a nice jacuzzi tub, two sinks, as well as a vanity which also is granite counter tops. The pool area is excellent!! The two pools were heated to a nice comfortable temperature in this Summer heat, they are open 24 hours, and quiet time is between 7am-10am, they also play light music out there during the daytime, which is nice to relax to. The pools were always clean and grounds are very pretty, lots of palm trees and greenery. They also have a nice hot tub which we spent a lot of time in, it has a waterfall that you can sit by while in the hot tub! They also have new propane Barbecue grills and even has refrigerators out there to keep your grilling foods cold while you are preparing, the barbecue area was nice and there was only a few people ever utilizing it while we were there. On the first floor in room 101, from 8-10am they offer a continental breakfast which consists of danishes, bagels and cream cheese, coffee, hot chocolate and different juices. I must also say all the workers were so nice, if we ever passed one in the hallway or outside they always said hello with a smile on their face and asked how we were doing; from the housekeeping, to the maintenance men, and other workers the all went out of the way just to say "hello". If looking for sites to see I strongly suggest the Valley of Fire, the drive is an hour away but it's a very easy drive and totally worth it because the scenery is beautiful and breathtaking, so pack a picnic and go on out there!
Room Tip: Ask for a balcony facing the pool, and if you are not happy with view don't hesitate to ask for...

We chose Tahiti based on reviews but it only takes 1 bad review to change your mind. When we confronted front desk they were extremely rude and the manager was very unprofessional. I do not recommend this hotel to my worst enemy! To top it off the pool was infested with bees! Get it together Tahiti!</p><br>We love owning here.<p>This is our favorite place to stay in vegas. We bought a week in a two bedroom unit about 5 years ago. And have used it every year. We have even split the time up and done a one bedroom unit in April one year and then the other one bedroom unit in the fallowing August. I am so glad we purchased here. It's so laid back and not busy. I have stayed a couple times on the strip and even though its nice being right there it is still crazy. So being a couple miles up on Tropicana is nice. They have shuttles that run you to the strip as well. We almost always rent a car when we are down there though cause we have friends out in Henderson we go and visit. But the staff is always nice and friendly. Everything is always clean looking. Plus even though its one of the older timeshares it doesn't look dated and it doesn't smell of cigeratte smoke. The two pools are great as well as the hottub. Both pools have a small sand bottom area at one end of them for the kids to play in. I love that the pools are open 24 hours as well cause we get back late some nights and we can still go for a swim and relax in the hot tub before going to bed. The rooms are so specious, the bedrooms are the size of a regular hotel room but the bathrooms are full size with a jetted tubs. There is his and hers sinks in the master bedroom and a closet with full length mirror doors in both rooms. But on top of the specious rooms there is a living room, dinning table, and full size kitchen with fridge, stove, oven, full size microwave, and a set of dishes and cooking wear along with a dishwasher. Then to top it off they have one of those half washer/dryer units in the closet with the hot water tank. So you don't have to take a tone of clothes on vacation. Since those baggage fees are out of control these days. They also have a fireplace but we have never had to use it. It does look nice though. I also love the fact that the drapes are really heavy so no light gets in when they are closed. Great when you are sleeping in tell noon. Almost every time we have stayed there we have had a pool view as well. I think the only thing I don't like about this place is you can't have pets at all. But thats not world ending cause I have friends and family that can watch our little dog while we are gone for a week. Also its a great place for a family vacation even though its usually just me and my husband that go either alone or with friends. They also have barbeques out by the pool for guests to use as well. Plus they hand out coupons and you can purchase discount tickets to area attractions and shows.
So over all I recommend this place to anyone going to vegas.
Room Tip: The pool view rooms are the best.
