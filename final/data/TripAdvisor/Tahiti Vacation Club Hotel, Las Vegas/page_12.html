<html><head><h3>Tahiti Vacation Club Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 12</h3></head><body><br>Like coming home!<p>We found this gem about 8 years ago after exchanging through Interval International. We enjoy the quiet location, the staff that ALWAYS helps out or try to accommodate our requests. We just returned from a week there and the only thing that changed is all the improvements to the rooms. We were 3rd floor Bldg A overlooking the pool. The room had 2 new large flat screen TVs, new sofa bed, new carpeting. The grounds inside and out are always well kept and we noticed employees never walking past a piece of paper without picking it up. The front desk and housekeeping personnel were all very welcoming. As described in other reviews, it is not a hotel, but an entire one (or two) bedroom apartment. There is no daily housekeeping, but staff will exchange towels when requested, resupply soaps, shampoos, etc if asked and will pick up trash when left outside the door. If you stay for a week, housekeeping DOES come in after 4 days to tidy up. The soundproofing is great - never heard a word from the pool even with young children playing out there at 8 pm. Heavy drapery keeps rooms completely dark and cool. We always rent our own vehicle, but their shuttle service (when we've used it on occasion) is always convenient and quick. We also enjoy taking the complimentary tour to Red Rock Canyon (it just costs the entry fee of $2.00) and the Fremont Street shuttle. We have stayed on the Strip and also at their sister property, Tahiti Village, and we MUCH prefer the smaller property. Quiet, clean, friendly, relaxing. It's like coming home.
Room Tip: 2nd or 3rd floor units may be a little quieter for those that are concerned about noise from the poo...

Check-in was a breeze and the Front Desk staff were very pleasant and very informative. We requested an early check-in which was no problem. The staff directed me to the closest door to our room so we could park our car near our room. After checking in I was directed to the Time Share desk to get our parking authorization. I thought I would be given a pressure sell right away, but I wasn't. Whew!

We were given room 112, a one bedroom suite with a full kitchen complete with a stove, fridge (with ice maker), dishwasher and all the implements a kitchen needs. A nicely appointed living room with matching sofa and chair. A large hi-def TV, DVD player and a docking station for your iPod. We even had a little balcony with a patio table and two chairs off the living room.

The bedroom was also nicely appointed with king size bed with another large hi-def TV on the wall. The bathroom had two sinks which I am sure my wife was pleased about. A huge soaker tub with a glass shower door.

My wife and I were very pleased with the room, but we always do a very thorough search for bedbugs in every hotel room we book. We looked around the bed. We looked under the mattress and box spring. We took off the bed linens. We took off the headboard. We looked everywhere and we were very pleased to find no bedbugs. We also check the bedroom chairs and all sitting areas in the living room. What we did find is that the room was spotless everywhere we looked.

All in all a very nice place to stay.

The cover parking was a nice touch. The BBQ's were a nice touch too. The pool area was nice and clean all the time. The floors seem a little thin as we could clearly hear the people above us when ever they moved about. The continental breakfast was just so-so. The tanning lotion smell in all the public areas was a to much. The Internet in the lobby was finicky. Also, if driving the right turn out onto West Tropicana can be nerve racking as the traffic goes by a quite a high speed and you really cannot see very far down the road.

Room Tip: I might suggest a room on the third floor to avoid noise from people above you.

Unlike the mega casino pools, this one is open 24/7 as long as you can keep it down. The pools aren't that deep, or wavy or really very special, but what's nice is you can BYOB. There's no $6 beers or $8 mai tai's, They have BBQ grills right by the pool for fresh steaks or salmon or whatever you might want. Adjoining the property are several restaurants that have to-go menu's also. The rooms were clean and nice. They don't have flat screens yet, but really, box tv's have just as good of a picture. The shuttle service is dependable and predictable - there's no need to be on the strip.
Room Tip: A two bedroom unit is awesome for families.
See more room tips</p><br>Nice enough but...<p>In a city that does things in a BIG way, Tahiti Vacation Club is a complex that does things in a small way, and mostly in a good way. It is located about 2 miles off the strip and has a convenient shuttle. The rooms are large and most have balconies overlooking the pool area. Yes, the rooms are dated and the furniture is well used but the bed is comfortable and the deck was nice to sit on in the mornings. The staff was very attentive and work very hard to make your stay enjoyable. Parking is very convenient. There are only a few things that were bothersome. The first was the cheesy, repetitive Polynesian music piped throughout the entire pool area for approximately 15 hours each day. It was very easy to hear in our 3rd floor room. As well, the continental breakfast was very simple and not what we expected. All in all, it was good value for a short holiday in Las Vegas.</p><br>Great for big groups<p>We booked 9 rooms for the family of a wedding. They were able to get us all rooms next to each other on the same floor which was great. we have two teen kids so needed two rooms so booking the two room suite was fantastic. We always try to rent hotel rooms like this, that are time share style rooms as the average hotel is small, stuffy and certainly without a kitchen. Having our own laundry set up was great and the kitchen was supplied with everything including toaster and blender. We bought food for the weekend and cooked and ate by the pool. This place had two big pools and a jacuzzi and the grounds were beautiful. There isn't daily housekeeping but when we did need extra towels they kindly brought them. The staff was nice and although we had to tell two people we weren't interested in hearing about their time share options, the check in process was easy. The neighborhood isn't one I'd walk around in at night but during the day it was less then a half block walk to a Starbucks, Denny's, and a pharmacy convienince store. Not far off the fwy either so all in all we would stay here again for sure!</p><br>Quiet and Relaxing<p>Great resort. Close to the action but far away for much needed peace and quiet. Staff friendly and helpful. The resort is very secure! On site parking w/short walk to units. Park across the street and great views of the mountains. No on-site casino, which was great because everywhere else, there is a casino on and off the strip!</p><br>Nice but Aging<p>We exchanged into Tahiti Vacation Club through Interval International. This timeshare is the sister resort to one we own in Las Vegas. Overall, the resort is clean and comfortable, but lacking in some of the amenities offered by the newer resort. The furnishings are showing the wear and tear of 12+ years hard use. They are, however, in the process of updating the furnishings (new TVs, etc.). Even though it's located on a major road, our room was quiet.

One big beef I had was the fact that they charge $6.50 PER DAY/$50.95 per week for wireless internet connectivity. Given that even the least expensive MOTELS (think Motel 6) provide FREE wireless internet access, charging these exorbitant rate is inexcusable! There is free WiFi in the lobby, which is not particularly convenient except for checking email occasionally.To add insult to injury, the signal strength for their WiFi is so poor that it's nearly unusable, especially if you regularly use Facebook and other web apps.

I would give the resort an excellent rating if it had decent WiFi.</p><br>Great place, close to the strip<p>We were pleasantly surprised when we arrived, we were worried this place would be a bit motel-ish, but it's really a nice place to stay. The room is large, well appointed and clean. The bathroom was clean and had plenty of fresh towles. We didn't use the pool but it looked nice and we saw other people enjoying it.

The room is large and the one we had included a kitchennette, complete with coffee pot, toaster, and small refrigerator. The bed was large, and there was a small table with a couple of chairs, as well as a small dresser. The room connected to the next one, but we don't know the people so we kept it locked, this would be a good suite if you had a number of people for a long stay.

The hotel is technically "off the strip" but actually closer than some of the ones that advertise they are. There is no casino here, but several within walking distance. The hotel also provides a free shuttle that runs every hour and drops you off at a couple of places along the strip. There is hotel provided Wifi but it costs, there is free internet in the lobby if you are in a bind, however.

I highly recommend this place, for the price and convenience I think it is a great value.</p><br>Better than I hoped!<p>We visited Las Vegas through RCI and exchanged a week of our vacation club for a week here at the Tahiti. We have been to Vegas and stayed on the strip so this was new territory for us...and we loved it! Our suite was large, clean and very comfortable. We had a balcony that overlooked the pool to have our morning coffee at, a huge bathroom with a great shower and double sinks. The pools were warm and not crowded, with plenty of chairs, the hot tub was comfortably warm. We had rented a car so never took the shuttle so we can't comment on that. Parking on the strip is free and plentiful, every hotel has "self park" garages. Having a car allowed us to spend our days out at the great state parks like Red Rock Canyon and Valley of Fire ;our evenings at the shows and casinos of the strip. Our concierge, Sean, was fantastic,and all the staff was very friendly and helpful. I was very pleasantly surprised at how great the place was and we would definitely return again. Next door was a Walgreens, a Denny's, Starbucks,a frozen yogurt place and a very good Mexican place ( not fancy but fresh and delicious) The only negative I have was the hotel breakfast was pretty poor-don't bother. Just pick up some groceries from Walgreens and make your own! And I had no trouble accessing the Internet from our room.
Room Tip: We liked the balcony rooms overlooking the pool-2nd or 3rd floor
See more room tips</p><br>Close to the strip<p>Spent 3 nights at the Tahiti Village in February 2013. We reserved a two bedroom and it was perfect for our needs. There are actually two rooms connected by a set of doors, one is a studio with a king bed, kitchenette and bath. The other room is larger with a balcony (we stayed on the 3rd floor, which is the highest floor available). This room has a full kitchen along with a 4-person dining table, sofa and fireplace, along with a separate room with a king bed and bath. We also had in-room laundry. Plenty of room to spread out.

The rates were very reasonable when compared to two rooms on the strip (I'm always watching out for resort fees, which can be $25/day or more per room on the strip). We liked the idea of being able to get away from the action.

We did not use the pools, though they looked well maintained. We are not breakfast people so just being able to make coffee in the room and/or go downstairs and get coffee and a bagel was just fine. Since we drove in we did not use the shuttle service at all. Parking is convenient, close to the room no matter where you are, and covered, which is a very good thing when it's hot outside.

Yes, the TV's are old school and there is no daily maid service, but we were up early and came back late so this didn't matter to us. We actually liked the fact that nobody was in our room during the day.

Overall a great stay and we would definitely stay again.</p><br></body></html>
