<html><head><h3>Tahiti Vacation Club Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 23</h3></head><body><br>Great if you can get the larger room/kitchen<p>We were a little worried reading the reviews, but our fears vanished as soon as we arrived.

The place was very well done. Our room was spacious and comfortable. The staff was friendly and worked hard to make us feel welcome. There were great deals on show tickets from the concierge, and phone calls from the resort with offers of family activities almost everyday (movie night, appetizer party, etc.). The one thing we did do was "upgrade" from a lock-out to a larger room wich was spendy ($51 per night) but worth it for the full kitchen/washer dryer and private bedroom. There are a host of restaurants and a walgreens right next door. Tahiti was a great way to see vegas without being on the strip. We will be back!</p><br>Great place for families/others off the strip<p>Here's a quick review of Tahiti (5101 W. Tropicana Ave), not to be confused with Tahiti Village

* Spacious 1-BR suite of 1150 sq ft (we upgraded for $50/night from a lock-out of 530 sq ft with only a microwave/small fridge) - we had 3 young children (ages 1-5), so plenty of room. We traded from Interval International.

* Very clean (housekeeping service 1x, midway through the week)

* Very helpful staff and concierge. Great discount tickets rates (better than at "tahiti village" nr the airport: Tahiti village quoted $31 for a $35 ticket to Nathan Burton, while Tahiti quoted us $12/ticket)

* Nice pool – but mostly too cold for us to use (January). The kids did go in 1x though!

* Full kitchen, washer/dryer - saved money/time on food (we did some take-out and some cooking) and laundry. Tahiti provided the dishwasher detergent, dish soap and laundry soap. (not all timeshares do!)

* Walking distance from a few simple restaurants for quick/cheap meals (denny's, papa johns, wingstop, mexican qdoba grill) and a walgreens. Also driving distance but close to grocery store Albertsons and non-strip restaurants.

* Off the strip - great location for our family - quiet in the evenings, no bright lights/music/street noise

* Used the free shuttle 1x - very convenient, on-time, they provided 3 child car seats. Shuttle stops at NYNY, Treasure Island and Orleans. Leaves Tahiti every half hour, and stops by each of these 3 hotels, 2x per hour. Driver helped me with the double stroller.

* Used our van and did valet parking (free, at all major casinos/hotels). Strip (2-3 miles away) and airport (4 miles away) are very close.

* Breakfast was a low-point, so we made our own in our room mostly. They only provide packaged/processed pastries (muffin, cinnamon roll), coffee and small cans of juice (great for packing for the day though!). On weekends, they provide frozen toasted waffles (yuck) although the photo ads show belgian waffles (that led me to believe they were freshly made like at the comfort suites).

We would stay here (in the 1BR suite or bigger, not the lock-out) again!</p><br>Think of it like an apartment, not so much a hotel. Still pretty nice.<p>Don't confuse this place with Tahiti Village, this is a different property, simply called Tahiti.

The hotel is located about a mile away from the Strip, which is a good thing in my opinion. The hotel offers a shuttle service, but I didn't use it. I would recommend renting a car and driving yourself to the strip.

The hotel is very clean, and nice looking. Has a nice south Pacific Tiki look to it.

The hotel offers parking which is gated after 11pm. The building is under 24 hour security, and is kept free of riff raff.

When we checked in, we did not receive a parking pass, nor were we told about such a thing. I parked the car, and received a warning ticket on the windshield that they were going to tow my car if I didn't have a parking pass. A quick trip to the desk took care of this.

The room was like a mini studio apartment. Granite counters, mini fridge, full set of dishes, cutting board, iron.

There is no housekeeping for guests that stay less than 7 days. We stayed 4 days, and ended up hunting down housekeeping people to see if we could exchange dirty towels for clean ones.

For guests that stayed less than 7 days, we could schedule a housekeeping service for $25 dollars per day. No thanks, how cheesy is that.

The bathroom has a jacuzzi tub, and a sliding glass shower, with terracotta tiles. Very nice and clean unit.

Too bad there was no hot water. Just tepid barely warm water. Not much fun taking a cool shower, or jacuzzi tub. People usually expect hot water in showers at hotels.

I pulled out my laptop in the hotel room to get some instructions for my day trip. Their WIFI is 9.99 per day, or 39.99 for the week. Again, no thanks.

Later that day, I grabbed a couple of beach towels, and noticed a note about "towel inventory", and how there would be a "$35 dollar charge per towel" if all towels weren't returned. Again, how cheesy is that?

The pool and hot tub area is very nice and clean. We found it to be pretty empty, not many guests there. The 2 pools are heated, and there is a hot tub with a waterfall. The pools also have a sand bottom entrance . Very nice.

Next to the pool area is a grill area, where I assume guests can do some grilling. It seemed pretty nice, but I didn't use it.

There is an Albertson's Grocery store about a block east of the hotel on Tropicana. We stocked up on snacks and some food and drinks there.

There is a Denny's Restaurant right next door, and a mexican restaurant.

Overall it was an OK stay. If Tahiti would throw in a few more extras it would make it a much better place to stay. I can't complain however. For the price, its not bad.</p><br>Quiet retreat from the strip<p>We are long time owners of a timeshare and the Tahiti resort was just as we have come to expect in a nice family resort. We had a very large two bedroom lockout that had a separate living room for the kids as well as a kitchenet and a large bathroom for them. We loved the quietness of this resort and the fact that the pool area was very well kept and you had plenty of tables and lounge chairs to pick from. The grill area of the courtyard was one of the nicest ones we have ever seen, with refrigerators even provided. The shuttle to take you to the strip was on time and convieniet. We liked the smallness of this resort because we did tour Tahiti Village and that was beautiful but could take 5 minutes to get down to the pool depending where you stayed. We like to just run up to our room for a cold drink or something we forgot and since every room was surrounding the pool courtyard that was very easy.
Compared to other timeshares this was above average.</p><br>Tahiti, very nice place. Not at all a Comfort Inn.<p>I stayed at the Tahiti from 7/27/07 to 8/3/07. I liked the resort very much. Had absolutely no problems with the staff. Everyone was very friendly. My one complaint is that they did not pick up the trash regularly. But when I called the front desk , it was picked up immediately. I exchanged into this resort through Interval International as I am a timeshare owner. Some people complain about timeshares, but it is a great deal if you like to travel. My friends were able to come to Vegas with me for just the cost of airfare. The timeshare deals offered at Tahiti were very good, so good that my friend bought one at Tahiti. She and her boyfriend loved it there. I would have bought there too if I didn’t already own one. As a guest, we received lots of discounts to attractions and shows and restaurants, and nightclubs, which we used. Because my friend bought a timeshare, we received free show tickets for all of us to see Matsuri, and $75.00 dinner discount at Gallagher’s Steak House, plus $25.00 off at Tahiti Joes at Tahiti Village. The timeshare presentation was low key and was held on the resort premises. We did not have to go off the resort. No one harassed us to attend. We were called once and agreed to go because of the free show tickets, but like I said the deals were very good so my friend bought one. She was planning to buy anyway as she knew the advantages of owning because of my ownership.

The resort is small, and a sister property to the larger and still under construction, Tahiti Village. The resort is immaculate. There are two pools, a water fall section and a large Jacuzzi with a waterfall. They also have barbeque grills by the pool area so guests can cook out. The setting is very tropical with palm trees, and light music. We enjoyed the pools very much as they were never crowded and the pools are open 24 hours. There is no gym on the resort, but they give free passes to a large fitness center right next door. You can go as many times as you like. The resort is next door to a mini mall, with several restaurants and other stores, which is very convenient. There is a Denny’s there too which had horrible food. The Mexican restaurant was excellent.

The resort has a shuttle bus that goes on a morning grocery run to a large grocery store named Albertson’s. It’s kind of expensive, but convenient. The shuttle also runs every hour to the Strip which was also very convenient. The resort is not very far from the strip. One night the shuttle was 30 minutes late and the front desk said to take a taxi to the strip, get a receipt and they would reimburse us. We went to Mandalay Bay which cost $10.00. The next day the resort reimbursed us the cab fare with no problem in cash. The resort also offers excursions to various sights in Vegas. We went on the Red Rock Canyon tour, but it rained that day and they cancelled the tour due to flooding (weird, flooding in the desert). Of course, they reimbursed us the $2.00 fee. The trip was part of the free offerings for guests at Tahiti. The fee was for the Red Rock Canyon conservation company. We were disappointed because of the rain. Everyone was saying it had not rained in Vegas for six months! But they offer other tours and show tours with discounts and round trip transportation. We also went on the Fremont Street Experience tour through the resort which was also free with round trip transportation from the resort. This was fun too, and we stayed downtown and did not come back with the tour, but rather took a bus to the strip and stayed on the strip all night.

We stayed in a two bedroom condo which consists of a large one bedroom with living room, kitchen , bathroom with whirlpool bath and a lock off section which was like a large studio with kitchenette and large whirlpool bath in the bathroom. The condo was immaculate. The living room has a fireplace with a balcony. The kitchen and bath have granite countertops. The kitchen is a full kitchen with dishwasher, all pots and pans and dishes and utensils. There is a washer/dryer combo in the main section of the condo, lots of space and plenty of towels. The tropical theme is repeated throughout the condo as the decorations seem to be custom designed with bamboo light fixtures, and palm tree prints on the furniture fabrics. It was all understated and very comfortable. There were televisions with music systems in the living room, and bedrooms. If you are staying here and you are not getting the complete 2 bedroom condo, make sure you do get the side with the full kitchen and not the lock off. The lock off is nice too, but it is much smaller than the side with the living room and kitchen. People mistakenly think the lock off is the standard accommodation, but it is not. It is just an extension of the much bigger one bedroom condo with full kitchen. Of course, the lock off is probably cheaper to get if money is an issue. But if you like space and all the comforts of home, get the larger size. This is not a Comfort Inn. I forgot to take pictures of the condo, but 360 degree pics on their website [--] are accurate views.

If I return to Vegas, I will definitely stay at Tahiti again.</p><br>A little worse each day<p>My first impression of the Tahiti was that it was very similar to a Comfort Inn. We booked for $77 a day for a Thursday to Sunday stay and were given a lock-off unit, which includes a small fridge, sink and microwave. Everything was clean and the bed was fine.
The upside:
1. Shuttle service from about 9 a.m. to 1 a.m. to several hotels.
The downsides:
1. No maid service, so no clean towels or trash removal. During our stays in other time-share properties we had towels replaced and other basic services.
2. Small, unattentive staff. Unless you butt into their personal conversations, they will not help you, whether it is for bell service, getting an answer to a question or even showing up for their time-share schtick.
3. The time share folks lie. (Not a shock, but really irritating when the reason we were willing to bite was because the presentation was to be at our hotel, meaning that the 2-hour presentation would really be only two hours.) We got an unsolicited wake-up call at 8 a.m. reminding us of our meeting. We were downstairs on time, but no one was greeting us. 15 minutes later we had to find someone to ask about it and they told it the presentation would be at another property, so they would call a cab, but that our 2 hours was already begun. They told us they would pay for it, but when we get to the other site, no one was there to pay the cabbie, so I had to pay him and try to get my money back later. Finally, from that point, we were back to the normal time-share games. But when all done, we wrapped up with the rudest salesman we have deal with and out 4 hours of our time.
4. GET OUT!!! While the reservations said check-out time was 11 a.m., upon check-in we are told it is 10 a.m. and if you don't check out on time they will double bill you for the final day. At 9 a.m., we were bluntly asked by the maid when we would be leaving and she then proceeded to - literally - sit outside our door and wait for us to leave.</p><br>A Great Alternative to the Strip<p>We exchanged our timeshare week in Puerto Vallarta to go to Vegas for the first time, (family of four), and we loved it! We rented a car for the week and used the Tahiti as our base. We used the valet parking at all the casinos/hotels and just tipped the valet a buck or two when they retrieved the car...convenient!

The Tahiti 2 bedroom units are spacious and well-maintained. The beds are very comfortable. There is a full kitchen, a mini-kitchenette in the other bedroom, 3 TVs, and a stereo and DVD player in the living area. The master bath is very large with two sinks and lots of granite counter space. There is also lots of closet space, including a full closet in the living room where my son stowed his stuff for the week. There is a small balcony with two wrought iron chairs and small table.

The two outdoor pools were very nice but not big. The one pool was heated and felt like bath water, the other pool wasn't and was very cold. The outdoor jacuzzi is very large with a nice waterfall and very clean. The week we were there Vegas had record breaking high temps in the upper 80's and 90's, so we were able to use the pools.

We did not use the free shuttle service, but lots of people staying there and at the sister resort, Tahiti Village, were using it, and we saw the shuttles everywhere on the Strip. Right next door to the resort there is a Starbucks and a Papa John's pizza. The unit had a dishwasher and a washer and dryer, which were really convenient.

I really have nothing negative to say. We are long-time timeshare owners and have exchanged many places, and the Tahiti is definitely one of the nicer units. There are, of course, not the amenities one finds at a fine hotel, so don't expect that if you opt to stay here. What was nice was being able to eat breakfast in the unit, even grill some burgers at the outdoor barbeques by the pool for lunch a couple days, and be only a mile or so from the busy, noisy, congested Strip. The salespeople didn't bother us once (although we declined to stop by the "Welcome" desk after registration since we know this routine!). We also drove to the Canyon for a day and a night during the week, which was awesome. The Orleans casino is withing walking distance of the Tahiti, and we went there several times to gamble and eat (excellent buffet there, and I'm picky!).

The resort offers tours to various shows and places, but we did not take advantage of these since we had our own car. What impressed me most at this resort was the cleanliness, and the abundance of fresh, quality towels and linens.</p><br>Had fun at the Tahiti<p>My friends parents own a time share here so staying here we got an incredible deal (paid her parents for use so they set the price they charged us). There was four of us girls who stayed for 4 nights. We reserved a two bedroom condo.

I was very surprised at the accomidations that we recieved. The condo was a pool view with a cute little balcony on the third floor. The condo was very spacious. We had a full kitchen with granite countertops and would have been very lovely to have cooked there if we would have wanted to do that. We did run to Albertson's down the street to get some drinks and snack items but didnt cook much of anything. There was a small dining room table, a full living room with a fireplace. Each bedroom had very comfy king size beds, it's own private bathroom with a huge tub/shower combo. One bedroom had a small "kitchenette" as it would have been a stand alone "lock out room" if you only wanted to rent for a smaller party. There was a washer and dryer in the main part of the condo. The bedroom had very effective black out curtains. Great for after a late night!!!

The pool area was very nice with a hot tub.

On a previous stay to Vegas I stayed in downtown on Freemont. While I liked being closer to action it was very nice to get away from the constant music that is played in that area and the lights of the strip. We like to party but getting back to the quiet room when we wanted to was very nice.

The area is less than a 10 dollar ride in a cab from the stip and very quick to drive.</p><br>Good value for the seasoned traveller<p>Located less than 2 miles from the strip, but with easy access to I15 and airport. The accomodation is large and clean. Not much ammenities onsite but has free shuttle to the main part of the strip. Don't expect to be pampered and you will enjoy your stay.</p><br>One visit is enough.<p>I'm at the Tahiti right now. So many little things prompt me to write. It's the little things that matter to some travelers, so while they are fresh in my mind, here they are:

1. "Equipped exercise room" is advertised on the Consolidated Resorts web site as well as the Tahiti guide book in every room. There is no exercise room. I asked the front desk clerk for directions and found this out. He gave me a pass for the 24 hour fitness club next door and said it is valid for a week. That's all well and good, but it's Tuesday, and I should have received this on Saturday upon check in.

2. Concierge: My past experience with concierge service is excellent. The Tahiti is an exception. Inside the room are guidebooks of Las Vegas with coupons for a variety of events. The concierge cannot contact these places and obtain the same discounts. It's unfortunate because a concierge at a time share should be able to get the best price. One of the events was at The Comedy Stop at the Tropicana (based on online reviews comedy is good, and price includes a drink). The concierge instead recommended the comedy at the Riviera because it was only 11.95 and I could "buy the tickets right upstairs." No thanks. Same went for a magic show - she couldn't call and get the same discount. No maps of the area either. She pointed us to the Walgreens next door where they are sold for $4.95.

3. Housekeeping is clean. They clean once a week (Tuesday). They came by at 9 and I asked that they return at 12 when we would be at an event. Instead, someone else returned at 10:30. This could have been a language barrier issue. I asked her to return in 10 minutes and we left the room so she could clean. When we returned an hour later, the maid was further down the hall from our room and sitting on the hallway floor. I've never seen a housekeeper sitting on the hallway floor. Ever.

4. Sunday's "Waffles with the Concierge" event on the Consolidated Resorts web site consists of waffles you toast yourself. During the rest of the week, there is no station of fresh fruit available (unless you listen to the time share sales).

5. Transportation shuttle to the strip is good. Drivers very friendly and on time. I would recommend an airport shuttle to the management.

6. Rooms are spacious and clean. There is a very home-like atmosphere. Grounds are well-kept, and security seems to be above par.

All in all, I would not recommend this place to someone who wants the fun accessible at all times. For that, stay closer to the strip. This resort is about 2 and a half miles away which is walkable, but definitely not at night time. Concierge leaves much to be desired as I feel they did not go the extra mile. Either schedule your shows and events based on the Tahiti's transportation schedule or prepare for a $15 cab ride ($11.00 plus tip) each way to the strip.</p><br></body></html>
