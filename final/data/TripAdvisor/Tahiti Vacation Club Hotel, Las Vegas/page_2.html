<html><head><h3>Tahiti Vacation Club Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 2</h3></head><body><br>Loved Tahiti<p>Arrived at noon after 10 hrs of travel. Couldn't get in our room early. There is a Denny's right next door as well as a pizza place, Chinese restaurant, wing place (tried and it was awful), also a Walgreens and an International Market within walking distance. We were offered a smoking room around 2:30 but decided to wait further for a non-smoking room. We had a one bedroom unit facing the pool and were VERY pleased with the accommodations. King sized bed that was comfortable, large bathroom, full kitchen stocked with anything you would require on a vacation. Unit was very clean and fresh. Only con was that the furniture in the living room area wasn't that comfortable for sitting - pull out sofas never are great for sitting on. There was a Continental breakfast every morning. The shuttle went to the grocery store 3 mornings a week, left every hour for the strip (Tropicana or Mirage (further up the strip). We used the shuttle to go to Freemint street on Thurs evening and could have paid $5 and went to Red Rock Canyon, which other guests reported was great. The unit included a safe (key) and washer/dryer. There was also a common area which had some nice looking bbq's for the use of guests. Two pools and a hot tub. We would have no hesitation in returning here. You could also walk to The Orleans hotel and casino which has a buffet and several restaurants (TGIF). There was also a good Irish pub and a Panda Express within walking distance. Shuttle does not allow luggage so you will need taxi to and from airport. Every staff person we encountered - from front desk to maintenance were very friendly. Our flight out didn't leave until 11:30 at night so they locked up our luggage and allowed us to keep a room key so we could use the shuttle after check-out. Had no problem with the free WiFi.</p><br>Can't Wait To Come Back<p>We arrived on a Monday night and were greeted promptly by a friendly front desk gal named, Sandra. There were no issues checking in. Our rooms were clean and equipped with everything we needed. We were all on the third floor and had balconies. The view overlooking the 24 hour pool was spectacular! At night, the lights in the pool make it so blue and enticing. The Palm Trees are just amazing and we really felt as though we were in Tahiti and not Las Vegas!! Parking is easy. There is a FREE shuttle that will take guests to and from either the Tropicana, or the Mirage 10 minutes after the hour, with the last bus being after 11pm Sunday - Thurs, and 1:20 Friday and Saturday. This is a huge convenience! Once a week, there is also a shuttle to Freemont Street but you have to sign up for it. Also, a shuttle to a grocery store if you'd rather not drive. The front desk has complimentary popcorn that is super delicious when you need that quick snack to go with your beer! The morning breakfast is between 8-10 am and has really good coffee, some fruit and bagel, muffin. It's not a full breakfast, but it helps with the morning hunger if you are being lazy by the pool! Marta, the breakfast lady, is so nice, that she will feel like family after your visit! Jose, a security guard, helped me out when my room keys all of a sudden quit working. I was escorted to and from the doors so that I wouldn't be locked out. I quickly got more keys made as Eddie - the kind maintenance man, came up to check out the door. It was not that big of a deal, but you do need to have working keys! Everyone is friendly and the service is timely! If you want Vegas but not the craziness of the strip, this place is the secret jackpot of all! And with the pool, hottub and BBQ facilities being 24 hours... it's priceless!!
Room Tip: Balcony overlooking the pool!

We quickly realized it was too far from the strip and was quite a trek to get out there. They do have shuttles that run to the strip but they only run once an hour which isn't overly handy when you want to go there and back. There was garbage underneath the couch cushions when we got there. We ended up moving the Friday night to the New York New York and love it. We would not stay here again.</p><br>Very quiet hotel during off-season<p>I stayed here for 4 nights in late August and everything was good. The hotel was quiet, the rooms were nice, the pool was great and totally uncrowded. We had a problem with drainage in one of the tubs, and Maintenance was quick to respond and resolve the issue. The front desk was very helpful with checkin/out. The only criticism I have is the pull-out sofa was not very comfortable to sleep on (per my brother).</p><br>Quiet, beautiful resort close to the Strip<p>We stayed at Tahiti for a week and had the BEST time! It's quiet, clean (with one exception discussed later), and the staff was so friendly and helpful.

PROS: Room appeared to be very clean, with no mold in the large bathroom; full kitchen; washer/dryer; lots of room; king bed was comfy and the pull-out wasn't bad at all; lovely pool area - open 24 hours - with 2 pools and a hot tub; nice towels; triple-sheets on bed; 2 large flat-screen TVs; shuttle service to Strip, grocery store, and Red Rock Canyon (I highly recommend you go there, whether on the shuttle or on your own - it is amazing!).

CONS: Way too easy to get it mixed up with the other Tahiti Resort that has a lazy river; WiFi/cellular service is spotty in the rooms; our balcony faced the parking lot; and our carpet was absolutely filthy - our white socks turned black in about 5 minutes.

The pros far outweighed the cons and we will be back for sure!!
Room Tip: Ask for a pool view unless you have young kids and are worried about the noise.

Tripadvsor has been no help at all, they claim they are trying to reach the property, it has been been 4 days! I don't trust a company who doesn't even respond!</p><br>Excellent Stay<p>We only stayed one night prior to another reservation. Excellent service - we arrived early so we were given access to the pool area while we waited. It was on a Sunday night so not too crowded. Room was comfortable with a king bed and fold out couch. The next morning they served a continental style breakfast and the lady behind the counter was a sweetheart. Greeted everyone that came in with a smile and a big Good Morning. She was great. Rooms were super clean - the housekeeping staff really do a great job here. Its located just off the strip - just down from Orleans hotel but they have a shuttle bus that goes to Tropicana and Mirage every 30 / 60 mins. Not sure.</p><br>Very Roomy<p>This our home time share and we've stayed here before. Mostly we use our time share to exchange and see other countries but once in a while we go to Las Vegas to see friends there or some shows in the hotels. Our grandson was visiting us and we had tickets to see two shows. Going to the time share was an inexpensive way to have two bedrooms a living room and two kitchens and a balcony. There is also a pool and a game room etc. It is only a 10 minute drive to the strip with all its amenities and therefore convenient to everything. We have the time share for about 12 years and it has basically not changed and is well kept. It has become time to replace some of the furnishings such as the carpeting for wear but other than that it all works beautifully. It is kept clean and repaired upon notice. The screen door on the balcony was laying on it side when we arrived. I mentioned it to management and they fixed it within the hour. Although there are two kitchens in the apartment there are numerous restaurants surrounding the property and of course all the restaurants and buffets on the strip. It was quiet and a welcome peaceful rest from the strip so you can relax at the pool or sleep at night. We did plenty of eating and shows and gambling at the big hotels and then felt great about getting away to an oasis later on.
Room Tip: Third floor in back or over parking lot is quieter.

We had two adjoining rooms and a pull down bed in the sitting area as we have a teenage son and daughter. We all had plenty of room. The pool area were so quiet. Not sure if the complex was quiet or that people weren't as mad as us Brits to sit in the sun! We have stayed in big hotels on the strip. The Ventian and the Encore but I enjoyed the distance away from the strip this time and the shuttle buses made it so easy to go in and out again. A very relaxing week was had.</p><br>no machines<p>running around the vegas strip is ridiculous machines and slots, bells and whistle non-stop, it was nice to stay here and not see one machine. building design and location of buildings very creative. The buildings are structured in such a way that you are away from the traffic and strip. the pool and hot tub area is so secluded you forget your in vegas. nicely designed.
Room Tip: get a room one the second floor
