<html><head><h3>Tahiti Vacation Club Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 22</h3></head><body><br>Wonderful!!!<p>We stayed at Tahiti Sat-Sat Oct 18-25, 2008. Booked directly through Consolidated Resorts (owners of the timeshare resort). Our week included a stay in a 2-bedroom suite. We were assigned Room # 219, 2nd floor, West view, overlooking parking lot and next door apartments. We arrived early (noon), but a room wasn't available until 3pm. We were asked if we wanted to attend a timeshare presentation for Tahiti Village (new resort), but we declined. They didn't push at all. In fact, the timeshare folks in and around the strip resorts are MUCH more annoying and aggresive.

Our suite was extremely clean and fully stocked. We grocery shopped for all of our breakfast foods (grocery was close) and ate only that meal in our suite each day. All other meals at restaurants. The kitchen had EVERYTHING you would need to do even the most adventurous cooking. Full size coffee maker was a plus. We visited the continental breakfast (very basic) offered each morning, and picked up a few danishes too.

We visited the pool each day, because the weather was perfect! There were no kids at the resort when we were there (hurray!). The pool was dead quiet, and this is exactly as we like it. Folks were around and in the pool, but there was no noise. One pool was heated and could be used for swimming. The HOT hot tub was great. We enjoyed the sun and read books.

We had a rental car (I would recommend this to everyone for a week's stay), but the shuttle was always around. We took the Red Rock Canyon bus tour offered by the resort. 3 hours and very informative. $2 per person, can't even drive it for that $.

The king beds were very comfortable, including 4 pillows per bed. The blackout curtains were terrific, and the windows were operable so that we could get some fresh air. The bathrooms were great, fully stocked and great water temp and pressure. Plenty of towels, including 2 huge pool towels per bedroom. Take them to the pool, and remember to bring them back to your suite. Watched ESPN Sports Center a few times during the stay, so the TV was just fine too.

We had housekeeping services just once during the stay. They restocked everything. Be careful! They come early, so if you want to sleep in, use the PRIVACY door hanger!

Overall, I would stay this resort had everything we want, including the critical "QUIET" we desired. Do not stay here if you want a rocking resort with lots of noise, eye candy and constant activites. This is a great place to retreat from the business of the strip when you have had enough. With our windows open and sliding balcony door open, you couldn't hear a thing, even Tropicana Ave (very busy road).

Please email with any questions or concerns: rmw5597@hotmail.com. Thanks!</p><br>Great Alternitive To the Strip<p>This is a really great hotel if you know what you are getting into. First off this is a timeshare resort so people are going to try to sell you one. (its funny that I got harassed more on the strip about a time share than at this place) upon entering you are greeted by a very tropical atmosphere, me and my wife checked in around noon due to the fact that our plane landed early and were very surprised our room was ready due to the fact that check in is at 4pm . The front desk help were all nice and happy to oblige you in any way that they could. Rooms were very clean and gave a sense of privacy when you wanted it. Granted this is a timeshare property so most of the stuff you are responsible for, however with shuttle service to the strip and an overall calming nature if you go into it with the right mindset you will have a great time</p><br>Great Value<p>We used an "interval getaway" to book a week in Las Vegas. We usually stay on the strip but thought we would try a more layed back location. The Tahiti is a quiet resort next door to a strip mall. The one bedroom apt we stayed in was nicely decorated, clean and fully furnished. Parking was always available for our rental car. There are plenty of reasonably priced grocery stores and restaurants close by. The employees were all very customer oriented and friendly. We were very surprised at how nice this resort is for the money. The Tahiti, Tahiti Village and Club de Solei are all owned by the same company. We will stay here again in the future.</p><br>A great place to stay and would stay again!<p>We booked our stay through Interval International. The interval members gave it a 92 percent satisfaction rating and we would give it 100! The staff was overly accomodating for anything that we could want. The housekeeping staff came in a day earlier than was stated (for our week stay). The unit was in perfect shape and washer and dryer are a luxury to have. It is nice to take home clean clothes! We did not use the shuttle, but have heard from others who have recently stayed that the shuttle is very easy and efficient. They even shuttle you to church! We kept misplacing our extra keys and had no problem getting extra ones. They offered us a welcome packet that we knew would lead to a time share presentation offer. I flat out told her that we owned 3 already and were not interested. She continued with her speech and seemed very animated by addressing my husband, who was not even there! (I had told her what his name was)
There are many restaurants nearby (Quizno's, Starbucks, Qdoba,Denny's etc.) The Denny's had decent food. The Quizno's was very good.
The traffic on Tropicana can be crazy during the height of rush hour, but overall the area was fairly quiet. The resort is 2 miles west of the strip.</p><br>Total relaxation + easy to the strip<p>We just spent the most relaxing week in Vegas, plus had the thrill of the Strip every night! Tahiti's shuttle service is excellent, easy, and dependable to 3 different spots on the Strip. The resort is very laid back with beautiful pools and bar-b-que area. Our room was upscale, clean, and very comfortable. Location was just far enough away from the rush of the Strip to be relaxing, but there was also a casino "The Orleans" within a five minute stroll. Also easy access to a grocery store, Walgreen's, and pizza place for the money-savers. Excellent place for anyone wanting Las Vegas excitement and a relaxing getaway from the real world!</p><br>Ok if you can avoid the hard sell<p>Time share complex...not a "Hotel" - My wife and I sayed as "Guests" of owners (her parents). It was our anniversay and we wanted a place to stay that was off the strip, but also convienent. This is pretty close...plus they have shuttles that travel every hour back and fourth from slect hotels on the strip.
It's also close to a 24hr fitness and some fast food joints.

The accomodations are ok at best...it's a suite. Quailty is ok not great. In ours the air filter hadn't been changed in at least a year. The dust balled up and would fall off each time the AC kicked on.
The pools were pretty nice...until you get in. Somthing that should be nice but wasn't was he sandy bottom of the pool...NEAT concept but failed. STAY OUT OF THE NASTY SAND!! Bandaids,, glass, nastiness of all types live there.

You get a complementory gift...BUT there is a catch..the hard sell. THEY WILL HOUND YOU your whole stay...want to go to a show for free?...come here about our other time shares. Want to have money for dinner? Spend an hour an a half at another property.....oh and by the way...you have to put a $20 deposit down to hold your spot.
IF that's not the worst you can't go anywhere on the strip with out being harrassed by Tahiti (village) sales people...it's almost worth staying on the strip or one of the hotels off the strip just to avoid the sell.....I would never stay there again.</p><br>Great place!<p>Great place to stay! Awesome bathroom, nice and quiet room, and close (but not too close) to the exciting strip! Also, it's right next to a Walgreens and Denny's so you can eat cheaply and get a break from buffets and also pick up quick things you may have forgotten to pack.</p><br>OK for the price<p>We booked into the Tahiti for our trip in early April. After reading the reviews I was quite excited. Overall it was pretty good for the price but left some to be desired.

Our plane was delayed which left us checking into the hotel around 12AM. When we arrived we were told that they had no more non smoking rooms (which is what we'd reserved) and that we'd have to take a smoking one, even though I'd called to confirm the reservation a day in advance and was told there would be no problem. We were told that non smoking rooms are only a request not a guarentee (fair enough but what if I had a smoking allergy?), and that we should check back in the morning to be reassigned to a smoke free room. Long story short, we tried to get into another room for 3 days and each day we were told that there was nothing available. Finally we gave up and just delt with the stinky room.

Other than that I was pretty impressed: fantastic 24hour heated pool, terrific bathroom with jetted tub, friendly staff and great shuttle service. The breakfast was truly awful but I knew that in advance from reading the reviews.

Overall I would recommend this hotel, just try to check in early to avoid similar problems with room requests.</p><br>I absolutely love this place!<p>This review is for the Tahiti Vacation Club, 5101 West Tropicana. There's a Tahiti Village too, so don't get confused.

To be honest, I am really hesitant to write this review because I love it so much that I want to make sure that I can get in here the next time I come to Vegas. I'm here when there are three big, big tradeshows in town and I booked this place because I didn't care if I was on the Strip or not. I just wanted a decent place for a decent price. I got that and a whole lot more. I can't stop telling people how much I love this place.

OK, it's basically a small timeshare type place. But there is no pressure tactics here. No worries about that. Check in was quick and friendly. I got the one-bedroom, not the lockout. I am really glad I did. I got a lot more space and it wasn't that much to upgrade. It's basically like a one-bedroom apartment. You open the front door and there is a little kitchen off to the side. It has granite counters, a full refridgerator, stove and open, microwave and dishwasher. It comes full stocked with plates, glasses, etc. There is a small dining table and 4 chairs and extending into the living area, a couch and upholstered chair, coffee table, armoire with TV, stereo and DVD player and a gas fireplace. There's also a slider door to the balcony with 2 chairs and a small table. My unit overlooks the pool area.

The bedroom is large and has a king, with another TV armoire. The bathroom has double sinks, granite counters like in the kitchen and a jaccuzi tub that came in very handy after a long day on a trade show floor! Finally, there is a stackable washer/dryer in the hall closet.

The resort has three smaller pools and a hot tub. The landscaping is nice, palm trees everywhere. There are grills so you can even grill by the pool. The lobby is decorated beautifully. They even run a shuttle to the Strip if you feel like walking around down there and you don't have a car. There's a concierge who will give you coupons and things like that. I can't even begin to imagine paying $400 a night for a room on the Strip anymore.

The location is on West Tropicana. There's an Albertson's about a half mile from here so you can get provisions. I am definitely going to come back here the next time I come back to Vegas. You may want the Strip and all that comes with it when you go to Vegas, and if so, this may not be the best option for you. Me, I want to get away from the Strip as soon as I can and the Tahiti is an ideal place to go "home" to.</p><br>Everything you need!<p>My wife and I stayed at Tahiti for three nights this February and were very pleasantly surprised! For the price, we expected basic off-strip accommodations. In reality, Tahiti is tastefully decorated, with fantastic staff and nice, clean rooms. Upon check in (which they allowed 3 hours early due to our arrival time) we were given a bag of lotions, gum, and other personal care products along with free show tickets and a free buffet coupon. What a nice bonus!

The room itself was larger than anticipated with a microwave, refrigerator and sink (all dishes provided). The jacuzzi tub in the bathroom was such a treat. But, far and away the best part of the hotel was the pool area. Multiple pools surrounded by plenty of chairs and shade along with a beautiful hot tub. Adjacent to the pool area is a great picnic spot with 4 large grills and some tables - next time I'll be sure to bring some hot dogs!

Overall, Tahiti is highly recommended.</p><br></body></html>
