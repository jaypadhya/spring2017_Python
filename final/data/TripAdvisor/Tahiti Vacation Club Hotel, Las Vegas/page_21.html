<html><head><h3>Tahiti Vacation Club Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 21</h3></head><body><br>Very happy at Tahiti :)<p>My husband and I stayed at Tahiti for the Labor Day Weekend. I had called ahead to request a pool-view room and that's what we got.
We had a one bedroom, which had a bedroom with king bed, nice sized TV and plenty of closet space. The bathroom had double sinks, large glass enclosed shower and lots of towels provided. The main living area had a couch, chair, dining set with chairs for four, kitchen area with full sized fridge and stove, microwave and dishwasher. The balcony had a small table and two chairs.
The pool area is very nice and very few people seemed to use it. (??) The most we saw there were 30 people and we spent two full days lounging! One pool seemed to be heated while the other was a little cooler. We didn't use the hot tub, but it looked very nice with a waterfall beside it. The water was very clean, as was the whole resort. We brought food and drinks poolside and it wasn't an issue at all (which is very important to us as timeshare users).
The free shuttle service to the strip was great (but a little behind schedule sometimes so plan accordingly). It will drop you at the Tropicana, NYNY, or the Orleans (one block from Tahiti). We walked to the Orleans and it took around 5-10 minutes. Next door to the resort is a Starbucks, Quiznos, Taco something, and a Walgreens (where we purchased milk, cereal, snacks, etc.)
The complimentary breakfast consists of toast, coffee, and juice - OK since its free.
Only one complaint - we had to pay for WIFI.
I would definitely stay here again!</p><br>Horrible Service, Rude Staff and Bad Location.<p>Ok I have stayed at many hotels in my time but this property has to be the worst of them all. I arrive in Las Vegas around 2:00pm get to the hotel which is all the way down Tropicana past The Orleans. Room is not ready and told I have to wait a few hours before it is ready. Ok so I leave for a few hours and come back (good thing I had a rental car) and check into my room. No view at all not even of the pool because the property is laid out more like a Motel 6 then anything else.

I had reserved a SMOKING ROOM. After unpacking I realize there are no ashtrays in the room. So I call down to the lobby and ask them for an ashtray. They assure me "no problem' I'll have someone send one right up. Ok so I wait...... and wait....... and wait....... about 45 mins pass and I decide to go downstairs to see where is my ashtray. (Now just FYI this property is small, its not LARGE like MGM Grand or anything so the service should be quicker if anything). Low and behold I reach the lobby and there are no less than 8 employees standing around DOING NOTHING. Chit chatting and the like. I approach the desk and ask where is my ashtray. They acted like they could careless and were very rude. I complained to the front desk and was told "I dont like your tone and if you continue we will call the Police" UNBELIEVEABLE.

Ok so we leave and hit the strip. Come back to the room and have a note saying please call front desk. They then inform me that the room they gave me was really NON SMOKING and would have to move me tomorrow. At this point im furious but take it with a grain of salt and say fine. The next morning we pack up and get our new room key. I look at the number of the room. It is TWO DOORS DOWN. Are you kidding me they move me 2 doors down and this room also had no ashtrays.

This HOTEL is miserable and I would not recommend it to anyone. I called Consolidated Resorts the owner of the hotel and got a form letter apology before I left Vegas. If you want a cheap hotel in vegas (eitther on or off strip this is NOT IT!!!)

Warning : Avoid This PLace at all COSTS!!!</p><br>Quiet easy and cheap tahiti<p>This was the first place we stayed at on our trip to the states. For those who aren't so fussed with gaming this is a great place to stay since there is no casino or fruit machines on the premises.

The hotel is quite close to the strip but certainly not walking distance. Saying that though, the strip isn't the most pleasant walking experience especially in the heat except perhaps around the Bellagio area. On the plus side there is a free shuttle that departs from the hotel for the strip every hour on the hour with connecting free shuttles to other parts of the city. While these went around the houses couldn't complain too much since they were free!

The interior is a bit soulless with cavernous corridors. However the pool area in the middle is very pleasant and the rooms are huge and comfortable with a nice kitchenette and even a spa bath. If you are staying there any less than 7 days there is no free maid service.

Being out of the town a bit, there is very little noise. The noise insulation in the rooms isn't that great but we weren't disturbed.

A very simple breakfast was provided, not particularly great and in a pretty awful room. Little else on offer than toast!

Parking was free and shaded. All in all - not a deluxe experience but comfy rooms and a good base to explore the crazy city that is Vegas.</p><br>Absolutely wonderful!<p>My husband and I stayed here for our honeymoon. We were very very pleased. It is located just far enough off the strip that its not chaotic outside of the property, yet it is only minutes away from the hussle and bussle. The staff was great as well as the rooms. My husband and I are very private and it was nice not to feel as if the hotel staff was watching our every move, yet when something was needed they were very easy to locate. They had a cookout in the pool area one day which we took advantage of, we purchased the tickets a few days before at the front desk. The pools were very nice, the sand bottom was unique. My favorite part was the outdoor showers. It was very very very hot all most too hot to lay out but I sat in a lawn chair near the shower and every 10 minutes or so I'd rinse off to cool down. The only thing that was a bit pathetic was the complimentary breakfast, we tried it once and it was pretty much toast and juice, not quite like we understood it to be, but there was a really neat hula video playing.

One day we went for the hoover damn tour and ended up deciding to go back to the area to rent a boat the next day to go out onto Lake Mead, INCREDIBLE!!! Anyone that has the chance to visit this magnificent place do!</p><br>A perfect oasis!<p>Before arriving here I was a little concerned at what we would find as we had paid so little. In fact I need not have worried. We booked a family suite which turned out to be two adjoning rooms giving a massive floor area, two en-suite bedrooms, two kitchens and a lounge area - probably about 100 sq metres of area all together. The rooms were well appointed with kitchen including dishwasher, microwave, big cooker, washing machine, tumble drier etc - so it would be an excellent option if you wanted to stay a week or more in Vegas.

Everything was immaculate - I think it must have been recently refurbished. The reception is a nice introduction, but the high quality remains throughout the premises unlike so many other hotels. The pool area is superb. When we were there it seemed very quiet with not many guests. Staff were very friendly and went out of their way to be helpful.

Next door there is a retail park with supermarket and various restaurants and take-aways including Dennys, Pizza, Mexican Chinese & Japanese.

One thing to be aware of - this place is not strictly a hotel. It seems to be some kind of time-share venture. This means there is no hotel bar or restaurant, and frequently you will hear potential clients being escorted around by rather loud and over-keen salesmen!

One drawback - standard check-in time is very late (4pm) and check-out time very early (10am). However they were flexible for us for check-out time, and also provided key card so we could sue hotel facilities, pool etc before we could check-in.

I'd strongly recommend this to anyone staying in Vegas - it's a great quiet, relaxed contrast to the strip which is all noise and lights!</p><br>This place was great!<p>Just got back from a week at the Tahiti Resort on Tropicana Ave. It was wonderful! The room (a one bedroom on the 2nd floor) was roomy, clean, and updated. The washer/dryer was very convenient.
The resort is in the perfect location- only took a couple of minutes to get to the strip!
It was pretty cold all week so we only got to use the pool once- but it was clean with plenty of seating.
The staff was friendly- we called once for more toilet paper and it arrived within 10 minutes.
This is a great, relaxing resort to return to after a long day on the strip!</p><br>Very Pleased with Tahiti!<p>We bought at Tahiti last year without ever seeing the resort based largely on the reviews at this site.

We spent a week at Tahiti at the end of March 2009 and loved it!

The rooms were very nice. They were clean, comfortable & well equipped. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. The pool area was excellent. The bbq area had lots of room and the bbq's were large and clean.

We liked that there was security on site and that the parking gates were locked at 10:00 pm.

The area has a drug store, coffee shop, 3 restaurants and 2 gas stations that sell liquor within 1 block.

The shuttle system is very handy, just make sure you tell the front desk that you are waiting for the shuttle; we got left behind once.

Taxi to or from the strip averaged approximately $15.00 / trip before tip.

Any complaints I have are so minor, they aren't worth mentioning.

As others have mentioned, it was nice to get away from the strip and just relax by the pool or to cook a meal instead of eating in a restaurant a few times during the vacation.

If you are looking for a quiet, off strip place to stay, this might be just what you are looking for.</p><br>Great Value For Money<p>Booked this place for a cheap quiet place to stay while in Las Vegas for NASCAR weekend. Knew in advance that Tahiti was a time share resort so expected to be bugged to buy in. Although we were asked to attend a presentation we declined and were not bothered again. The property itself was terriffic, a nice place away from the hustle of " The Strip". Rooms with kitchenette were roomy and comfortable. Heated pools and the spa were a plus. Hotel is about 2 miles off the strip but does have shuttle. We had rental car so no real concern to us. Would be a great place for families to stay to enjoy Las Vegas without the hassle of having kids in a hotel on The Strip</p><br>Perfect alternative to the (expensive) Strip<p>My son and I stayed Thanksgiving week. Since we were in town to see other sights, not just the strip, this was perfect. We used an Interval "getaway" and rented a one bedroom. The kitchen allowed us to eat more cheaply and was VERY nice. The bathroom arrangement is fabulous. I could wake up early stay in the bedroom, watch the news, etc while my son slept in the living area. The concierge was very helpful and we received NO selling pressure. The shuttle to the strip was a lifesaver and we used it several times. Nearby shops and eating places were cheap and good. The room was clean. We would stay here, again.</p><br>Not recommended<p>This place was certainly not the cleanest resort. Stairwells had horrible odors. The staff was very rude. During our stay we along with others complained - perhaps this is why the staff never seemed happy or helpful. The pull out coach mattress needs to be replaced. The dishwasher and washing machine had minds of their own....sounded as if they were gearing for take-off! The rugs were filthy, the shuttle never seemed on time and the drivers must have gotten their license in a gumball machine. Pool was filled with debris and the vending machines never worked.

Having worked in the hotel industry for many years, this resort should be rated 3 star at best. I would highly recommend you stay elsewhere!!!</p><br></body></html>
