<html><head><h3>Tahiti Vacation Club Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 5</h3></head><body><br>Tahiti Vacation Club, as great place!<p>A great hotel, quite and well maintained with friendly staff clean rooms and with free breakfast and shuttle to the strip make this a must stay to be close to the strip but not overrun by the hustle of Vegas.</p><br>Tahiti Vacation Club: a good "base camp" in the Las Vegas area<p>We recently stayed at the Tahiti Vacation Club one of the Interval International Properties in Las Vegas for five nights.The resort was clean, well cared for, and organized. The front desk staff was pleasant, knowledgable about the property and surrounding areas, and always available.

Upon arrival we asked to see the accommodations we originally booked (studio) and then asked to see a one bedroom suite to see the difference in the size in case we wanted to upgrade. The front desk staff walked us to each type of accommodation and provided us with a detailed overview of what each level of accommodation would offer. We opted to pay for the upgrade for $15 per day which doubled the size of our room and increased the in room amenities. The accommodations were were spacious and well stocked with supplies for use of the facilities offered in each level of room (pots, pans, dishes, silverware, blender etc.). Ample towels, pillows, and blankets were stocked in each room. Basic linens and bathroom toiletries were provided along with dish soap, a sponge, and laundry detergent. All of the appliances were well maintained, functioned, and very clean. There were a few dings on furniture and the walls, but nothing that took away from the functionality of the accommodations. You could on occasion, hear other guests talking if they were extraordinarily loud, but even having a room on the first floor did not seem to be a problem in terms of sound. Room cleaning services were offered 1 time during your week long stay for no charge. Additional services were available upon request for a minimal fee.

There were two pools and a hot tub on the property that were well maintained and frequently cleaned through the day. All three were heated to reasonable levels despite the warm air temperature. There were ample lounge chairs spread throughout the poolside that could accommodate approximately 50+ people. There were thatched roofed poolside cabanas that served as shade umbrellas that did not require a reservation. There was a small four hole putting green that was available as a quick outdoor distraction / activity (all of the equipment was provided via the front desk for no charge).

Each morning a modest continental breakfast was offered that was available for 2+ hours and restocked and maintained by a pleasant resort attendee (bagels, muffins, fresh fruit, juice, coffee, tea, and water).

Each afternoon fresh popcorn was made available to guests via the front desk staff.

There were shuttle services available to access the main Las Vegas strip (via two stops: Tropicana and Mirage Casinos), local grocery store, and the "Old Las Vegas" Fremont section of town. We never had any difficultly gaining access to the shuttles as they ran frequently and were prompt. It would have been nice however, if there was a third stop along the strip.

There was a small "activities room" that offered a pool table ($1 fee), foosball table ($1 fee), 2 large video games ($2 fee), a television, chalk wall, and tables for playing cards or games. There were a few arts and crafts offered for families with small children during the week that were hosted by the staff. Although spacious, it would have been nice to have had some games or other options available for guests to use in this activity room.

The "owner's lounge" was limited in its offerings (coffee, tea, water, a few books, a television, and tables for playing cards or games. DVDs were available via the front desk for no charge. There were two computers for usage with no charge.

Free wifi was offered throughout the property and basic snack vending machines.

There was concierge service available from 8 am - 5 pm daily. We did not make use of these services because we pre-booked shows, dinners, and a rental car.

We had no major complaints. We would stay here again in the future if we were coming back to the area. The location allows for walking to a Walgreens, gas station, and various take out food restaurants. We used the property as our "base" and pre-planned day trips to the Grand Canyon, Hoover Dam, local parks, and spent our evenings out and about on the strip. If you are expecting five stars and endless service / entertainment like other hotels / casinos on the strip, this may not be the property for you, however with reasonable travel expectations and recognizing what the property offers I think most people would enjoy staying at this vacation club location.
Room Tip: Rooms that are on the outside of the property are quieter compared to those overlooking the pool.

Given my husband is a hotel concierge and we're not gamblers, I wanted something off the strip and quiet. This tropical oasis away from the craziness of the strip was just what we needed.

We checked in an hour early, but they still had our room ready to go. Ray at the front desk was very helpful and also noted everything I put in my reservation notes. He made a point to let us know if we needed anything to just ask, and this kind of service was worth mentioning. We had reserved a studio suite, and got 208A.

The room was quiet, had a view of the courtyard by the putting area and came equipped with everything we could need. The bed was comfortable, and the kitchenette suited us fine. The hotel is not in the greatest part of town, but we never felt unsafe. There's a shopping center with a Denny's and 24 hour Walgreens next door. Taking a walk or drive 1 mile west down Tropicana and there's another shopping center where we found the Black Bear Diner which is highly recommended.

The pool and spa are open 24 hours which is unheard of anywhere. The service we received from all staff was great. They even accommodated us for a late check out at 11:30 since our flight wasn't until 10pm. I wish we had taken advantage of getting married at their sister resort, but in the end on our last day we got married at a chapel downtown.

Overall, it was a great stay and we will definitely be back. If you're looking for a party place by the strip and gambling, this isn't for you. But if you want to escape the insanity of the strip and relax when you return to your hotel, this is the place to choose,
Room Tip: Even numbered rooms before 20 should be quiet. (ie 120, 220, 320)

Room Tip: building c is in the very back so it is away from everything! loved it
See more room tips</p><br>Very Nice off The Strip place.<p>I stayed here with my friend's time share package. Service has been great. We had booked adjoining rooms prior to arrival, but when we got here they weren't available. The front desk staff said they could fix that the next day, and they did. We were on the 3rd floor poolside, at opposite ends of the hallway. I was a bit concerned about evening noise at first, because my studio room was right above the hot-tub, and there were some partiers drinking beer and shouting. But that didn't last long. One we were moved our rooms had a view of the parking lot, some not as pretty but quieter.

The rooms are spacious and modern, but the studio room could use a comfy couch or chair besides the kitchenette chairs (as there is plenty of space to add one).

The pool area is nicely located between the two wings of the hotel, so it is very quiet as far as traffic noise goes. It is open 24 hours, so you can go for a midnight swim and look up at the stars between the palm trees. There are two pools and a fountain, as well as a hot tub with a small waterfall attached. We were string in it at night with a couple of belies and really enjoyed ourselves.

There is a free breakfast, but it is very minimal. Only bagels, muffins, oranges and bananas, with some OJ, coffee and tea. I think they could add more here, but it is adequate. They also have a small shop in the lobby for snacks and toiletries which is convenient. We shopped at the 24 hr. Walgreens next door. Also on the property next door is a Dennis, and 3 more chain restaurants. A 7-11 is also on the block.

They have a shuttle that will take you to the strip, and it runs from 9:10 am to 11:10 pm, and runs on the hour every hour. This takes you down to 2 areas of the strip (Tropicana and Mirage) as well as services 2 other properties.</p><br>Very nice place. Highly recommended!<p>Love this place. Great place to stay in reference to the strip and being a little distance away and not in the middle of the crazy strip. Great kitchen for cooking and eating! Plenty of space in the 2 bedroom units. Love having a washer and dryer in the unit to do a small load of clothes. Housekeeping and Front desk were awesome!
Room Tip: Kitchen even had a blender to use for making drinks!
See more room tips</p><br>Family vacation Las Vegas<p>We are owners at this timeshare and love the fact that it is quiet and relaxing. The rooms are always very clean and the staff is very friendly. There are two pools, a hot tub and an area for grilling. Most rooms have a balcony or patio for relaxing with your morning coffee.</p><br>Desert oasis<p>This property has all you need for a great vacation! We had a 2 bedroom with a full kitchen. There are several large chain grocery stores within a couple blocks. We drove to Vegas, so had our car, but they do offer a grocery service through the resort. We made breakfast, then took the convienient shuttle to the strip for the day! The shuttle goes every hour, dropping off at either the Tropiciana or the Mirage. They also provide a shuttle to Fremont street a couple nights a week. The 2 pools & large hot tub were clean & felt great after walking for hours! They are open 24 hrs. Grilled steaks on the provided grills by the pool, & took the shuttle to the strip or Fremont street to finish off the day! The beds are triple sheeted, linens very clean. We had a problem with the DVD player, & maintance was there within a 1/2 hr. to fix it. Friendly, helpful staff! Would highly recommend it!
Room Tip: Long hallways, ask for a room closer to the elevator.
See more room tips</p><br>Always Relaxing<p>We have stayed many times at Tahiti. The service is wonderful. The staff is very friendly and helpful.On more than one occasion we were able to leave our luggage before check-in time. Our room was on the first floor, facing the pool. We had a full kitchen and a washer and dryer in our suite. There are grocery stores down Tropicana heading away from the strip.There is a Wahlgreens within walking distance.
The site has two pools, a hottub, putting green and an area for BBQing. There is plenty of free parking.
Tahiti is on Tropicana Ave. and is about 5-10 minute drive from the strip. There is a mini bus that will take you to the strip. We prefer to rent a car for trips around the area.
Room Tip: Rooms facing the pool are our favorite.
See more room tips</p><br>Decent Property<p>Check In process was very efficient. The Front Desk agent whisked me through and done inside 5 minutes. The Rooms themselves were older but were still decent, King Bed in the Master and the 2 Bedroom we had was a lock-off so the other room was a Suite with a Kitchenette which was quite nice for the other traveling party to have their own separate bathroom/fridge. The Parking was awful, I wasn't given a parking pass on the first night which led to a warning I would be towed, the 3rd night we were not able to park on the right side of the complex which led to quite a long walk after a long day at the NASCAR races to the room. Many of the lights were not operating properly and flickered off and on all the time. The WIFI was "ok" at best, but for free you were able to check email and do some basic surfing of the news etc. The Elevators are only at one end of the complex so if you end up with one of the higher numbered rooms you either had to walk all the way up and down the hall or take the stairs, for whatever reason this is the same as this resorts sister property and is a huge design downfall. Location is everything in Vegas and although on a map this property looks great, getting in and out can be somewhat dangerous. Tropicana is a 6 lane (3 each way) road that is quite busy, the way the gate/bushes on the road are if you try to leave at the Western Exit you cannot see traffic, it is a little bit better at the East Exit but if Tropicana is busy it can take you sometimes 5-10 minutes to get out into traffic. Turning left out of the property is almost impossible forcing you to loop around the block.
Room Tip: The Outside rooms have some road noise due to the parking situation. If you don't want a long wa...
