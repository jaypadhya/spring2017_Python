<html><head><h3>Tahiti Vacation Club Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 11</h3></head><body><br>Great as usual<p>This is our 3rd time staying here and we always leave happy with no complaints. Many people confuse this property with their sister property Tahiti Village on Las Vegas Blvd. This is not Tahiti Village. This property is located on W. Tropicana Ave, a short distance from the strip. It's a quiet 2 building, 3 story hotel/timeshare property. My in laws bought a timeshare unit here and we are so glad they did. Our unit is a 1 king size bedroom with a full kitchen and all utensils, pots, pans. plates, cups etc are included. It has a dishwasher, stove and full fridge. It's a regular size kitchen that is fully equipped for any meal you would like to prepare. A coffee maker, toaster and blender is also included. The unit also has as small washer and dryer. During our stay we had housekeeping come in to our room once which is the normal for a week long stay. They dont come in to make the beds and clean your room daily like a hotel. Housekeeping did knock on our door a few times to see if toiletries or towels were needed. They gave us plenty of towels for the week and a change of linens. Our unit had been renovated since we were there. They added flat screen tv's. We did not notice any "stains" on the rugs nor did we look for them. We aren't that type of guest. While in Vegas we aren't the type to spend much time in our room so those minor things dont bug us. What we do like is the convenience of having a full size, fully equipped kitchen and separate bedroom. I get up earlier than my husband and its a pleasure getting up and being able to leave the bedroom and making a pot of coffee without having to wake him or get dressed to go downstairs to get coffee. We also enjoy that this property is off the strip and very quiet. When we have had enough of the strip we have a quiet place to go to. They offer a free shuttle to and from the strip so its very convenient. If you chose to not take the shuttle, one of the front desk staff will call a cab for you. A few times we returned to our room after the shuttle ended around 1am and had to take a cab but it was no biggie. The Tahiti is within walking distance to The Orleans, Walgreens, Denny's, Starbucks, Quiznos, Qdoba Mexian grill, pizza and a few other food choices as well. They also offer a free shuttle to the supermarket about a 2 minute drive up the road. Our unit is always clean and spacious and the beds are comfy. The pool and pool area are great too. Never crowded, pretty quiet and they also have bbq grills if you want to grill some steaks for dinner. We've never done this but I have read they allow you to bring your own alcohol down to the pool area as well. The pools are clean and maintained daily. The staff is friendly and helpful and do everything possible to make your stay a great one. Even If we didnt own a timeshare unit here I would still stay here. My only con was we had a unit on the 2nd floor and our neighbors above us allowed their 3 children to run throughout their room waking us at 8am a few times. That was not the Tahiti's fault and when I mentioned this problem to the front desk person they offered to change our room or call our neighbors to ask them to not allow their kids to run that early in the morning. We opted for them to call our neighbors since we had unpacked and were settled in our room. After that, we didn't hear the kids again. So next time I may request a room on the 3rd floor. Can't wait for our next stay here.
Room Tip: If you are a light sleeper perhaps a room on the 3rd floor may be good
See more room tips</p><br>Very good with an *<p>Ok, so we wanted to take the kids to a fun hotel with a waterpark in always-sunny Vegas. When we tried to check in on our day it was 1 pm but were told check-in is at 4 pm and we sat in the car for 3 hours and got the key right at 4 pm and not a minute sooner. We were offered a pool pass but getting to the bathing suits out of the suitcases would have been too difficult. When we made the reservation I wanted to book the larger unit with a full kitchen but it was not available. We settled for the lockoff with a King bed and a sleeper sofa. For 2 adults ad 2 kids that is really cramped quarters! The kids complained about the awful foldout mattress which was just springs with a little bit of fabric over it. But the major beef we had was with this "partial" kitchen. There is a small fridge and a microwave, but making meals there for the family is an illusion. We had brought a single burner electric hotplate and a couple of pans knowing about the absence of a stove, but there were absolutely no utensils for cooking, no microwave dishes, no dish rack for washing dishes (no dishwasher) and 1 kitchen towel. We ended up eating out mostly since that "kitchen" was totally useless and it ended up being a drain on our vacation budget. There are also no washers and dryers in the smaller unit and the laundry room costs money. On the bright side, the grounds were well maintained, the pool areas are nice but going from the lazy river to the large pool area was a pain. There is an adult jacuzzi which was nice since the "open" jacuzzi ended up being a "brat's bathtub". No supervision from staff there. We had an awesome view of the strip from our 7th floor room in building 5. The parking garage is a nice feature since the car was not hot when we got in. Overall, we would stay again, but NEVER in the "partial" kitchen unit.....
Room Tip: By all means get a room with a full kitchen!

All was good, but maybe 2 critical points I could describe would be the new shuttle route and pool etiquette. We often ate and gambled at the Orleans, but the shuttle skips that stop now, which made it inconvenient for us. And some people at the pool thought it would be acceptable to put their chairs right in the kiddie pool, which wouldn't have been nice for kids. Thankfully, we weren't spending time at the pool at that time. Can't wait to stay again, even with the beefs.
Room Tip: We were in 221, and the balcony faced the parking lot, but had sun late in the day, when the pool ar...
See more room tips</p><br>Unexpected pleasure<p>We ended up at Tahiti after our delayed flight caused us to lose our Tahiti Village reservation. Although I wasn't fascinated by the location, after we rented a car, we mostly enjoyed our stay. The rooms are spacious, the beds are comfortable, and the pools were nice. We were looking forward to the lazy river at Tahiti Village, and the availability to shuttle us to the airport, but we were able to make other accommodations. My complaints are that Tahiti Village was not honest about how we lost our reservation. They tried to convince us that the reservations were for Tahiti all along. The owner of the time share called the next morning and was told our room was given away because we were late. Another complaint would be the guest breakfast. I appreciate that there is a shuttle to the grocery store in the mornings, but the addition of fresh fruit and oatmeal packages would improve the guest breakfast. My last complaint was the slow tub drain. Both rooms we stayed in had slow drains. I will admit that when we called the front desk, Roberto and Jason came right away and fixed the problem. I never figured out where the restaurant was, but the staff at Tahiti is really friendly and helpful.
Room Tip: Pay the extra for the deluxe room. You will save by purchasing groceries and preparing your own meal...
See more room tips</p><br>Warning! May transfer you to their "sister property".<p>I booked a room at Tahiti Village on their website. Upon arrival, I was told that our room was at their "sister property", Tahiti Vacation Club, on Tropicana Avenue. Tahiti Vacation Club was okay, but there was no lazy river and no huge pool area, and of course it was too late for me to cancel the reservation without paying for the first night. I got the distinct impression that this was a scam, and even more so after reading other reviews where people arrived and did not have a room at all at Tahiti Village. The employees were nice and told me this property was better than Tahiti Village, because Tahiti Village was too crowded but, again, I got the impression this was all a scam and now I'm wondering how many people paid to stay at Tahiti Village but got stuck at Tahiti Vacation Club. I still have the email confirmation and all it says is "Tahiti Las Vegas". I'm not stupid ... I have a college degree and own my own business, and I know when I've been ripped off. I do not trust this place and I will never stay there again. Having said that, this resort was okay. The employees were friendly and helpful, the rooms were spacious and clean. There were 3 pools in the courtyard, 1 was a small kids' pool, and 2 bigger pools. Okay place to stay, but not what I booked ... not at all!</p><br>Better than I thought ... was content during our stay<p>Stayed 4 days (of my 7-day timeshare exchange) at the Tahiti. Was in LV for the first time with my siblings for a wedding. Could have stayed at the strip hotels reserved for wedding guests, but opted to use an Interval timeshare exchange. I did this with bravery as I've had a very bad experience recently with an Interval exchange in Puerto Vallarta. I read reviews on the Tahiti
over and over, checked photos and figured I could give Interval another chance.

Checked in on a quiet Thursday afternoon. I was the only one checking in and got the full and friendly attention of the staff. Good start :) Got a little lost through the "maze" of exiting the main lobby, going around the pool area, then to Building A and up the stairs to find my second floor 1-bedroom unit. Didn't realize there was an elevator somewhere, but no big deal as I just had one relatively light carry-on luggage with me. Building A seems like newly-renovated. Carpeting looked brand new and hallways smelled fresh. Our unit was tidy and welcoming in appointments. Sofa looked new. Dining chairs were not entirely new -- a few stain spots in a couple of chairs, dining table had a few hardly noticeable smudges -- overall, decent and not "yucky" as in the Interval property I stayed at in Puerto Vallarta. Bedroom was fine. Bathroom was good, except that the shower/tub drain would clog as you shower and drain very slowly.

The Tahiti clealy discloses that they don't provide daily housekeeping services, so that helps manage expectations. They only provide mid-stay (mid-week of a 1-week stay) housekeeping
but guests can request replenishment of towels and toilet supply. We were perfectly fine with that being very clean people, who like keeping everything around us clean and tidy by ourselves, anyway. The househeeping staff was very friendly and generous when I asked for replenishments.

Our unit faced the parking lot and the next door condominium property. Perhaps a unit facing the pool would have been better for the "view", but then the trade-off would probably have been noise from the music playing constantly and children playing, if there were. The Tahiti didn't seem full at the time we were there so that wasn't a real issue. At the same time, we were constantly out due to the wedding activities so, we didn't really see how packed the pool area was not did not even get the chance to enjoy the clean and inviting pool! If anything, our unit's location was so convenient as we simply walked out the exit stairway near our unit, went down one flight of step, and out the door right by where our car was parked. Very convenient!
Besides, what spectacular "views" could LV offer anyway? In this case, "view" (or the lack of it)is not at all a negative factor with the Tahiti.

Best of all, the Tahiti's location is so ideal. You're not on the loud, congested strip; yet, close and a short driving distance to the strip and everything else. Next door is a Walgreens, a spa/salon, a few restaurants for a quick meal.

Didn't bother buying WiFi for the room, but just went down the lobby when I needed to print my
boarding tickets for my next-day flight home. We also didn't avail of the freee breakfast just because we had other activities in our itinerary. It was good to have that option though.

Kitchenware was in good shape and very clean -- wine glasses, plates, utensils were clean and not disgusting to use. I am very picky with these things, by the way.

Overall, I was quite happy with the Tahiti and would recommend it. It was a good choice!
Hope they keep it up.
Room Tip: Building A seems recently renovated. Clean and fresh-smelling!
See more room tips</p><br>very satisfied stay at tahiti<p>Stayed for 1 week in a studio suite in June.They allowed me to upgrade to a 1 bedroom at a very reasonable cost, after viewing the 1 bedroom i found the studio would be sufficient. The studio was perfect, very clean,comfortable and quiet. Charles at the front desk was very pleasant and always had a smile, I did not need a car as the shuttle was great for my needs although it would be great if they gave you a little more time to shop for groceries. On Wednesdays they have a BBQ lunch for 5.00. Staff did another great job in providing guest with a great lunch and was a good opportunity to meet with people and express your views of the pros and cons of the property with the manager. I really found no cons to speak of, Maybe you may consider to not offer the free coffee and danish in the morning, especially if some people do not appreciate it and are expecting you to feed them breakfast. Instead maybe you can have fresh watermelon water or cucumber water offered at the front desk area...In closing i found the TAHITI to be a great vacation experience,very relaxing by the pool and enjoyed the wonderful hot tub and yet when you want the intensity of the Vegas strip hop on the shuttle and leave the driving to them... i surely will return and BIG thumbs up to the TAHITI. Keep up the great work. Regarding poor wifi on property, if one can get over having to use your devices for a week or so and relax and enjoy your vacation life may be a little more relaxing for a change,, worked for me, Front desk has free use of a computer if you really need, which i used to print my boarding pass for flight back home. Thanks again Tahiti for providing me a relaxing vacation, Will be back again..Philip</p><br>March Visit<p>Went with another couple for a 6 night stay in March.
The rooms were jost ok.

The gas grills did not work and the staff was unhelpful when it came to lettign us back into our room. THe key locks did not work correctly.

All in all just ok.</p><br>Relaxing Holiday<p>We stayed in the Tahiti Vacation Club for three weeks in May/13 and enjoyed this resort and location very much. The staff could not have been better to us. Friendly and helpful. The unit we had was right by a pool on the second floor and was pretty to sit on the little balcony and have a coffee or drink with your book. The pool area has sand at the low end which allows you to put your chair in the water or for little children to play.
We did not find it noisy as everyone was considerate of others. This was the best service we ever had at any resort and we have been members of RCI since 95 and have travelled alot. If you needed anything it was either their before you had to ask for it or the housekeeping staff were knocking to see if you needed anything. We would recommend this resort for sure. It has a shuttle service that will take you down to the Strip on the hour and back on the half hour. You could go to either the Mirage or New York New York. This is more convenient than taking your car as you don't have to bother with parking. The staff will arrange tours and suggest fun things to be sure to take in. They were knowledgeable and efficient. The Orlean's Casino is across the road a bit and has a tasty buffet. (Joint the casino clubs and get a discount for the buffets) We knew that there was also the Tahiti Village and it is bigger and probably has a few more facilities like a lazy river but more people and the road there is very busy so in the end we were happier at the smaller sister resort. Also, the units are being updated with new carpet, flat screen TV's and sofas. This would probably be completed by now and the process did not disturb us at all as they were quiet and selective in the manner they did the changes. We had a unit that was already updated. Mattress was very comfortable. Thanks to the resort and the staff for a great job and a well run and clean resort.
Room Tip: Try to look at the pool or else you will you may be looking at a parking lot. There is a Denny'...
See more room tips</p><br>First Time in Vegas<p>This is the first time I have ever been in Vegas. We were there for a convention. We were all very happy with the room and the staff seemed friendly. We did have issues with the a/c in our room. If you want a little distance from the strip this is a great place to stay. However, when I got home I found an additional charge for $23 on my credit card and I have been trying to call the hotel to find out why and can not get anyone to answer the phone. The first phone call rang 30 times before anyone answered and just put me on hold. Since they never came back on the phone after waiting for over 5 minutes I tried calling back and this time a recorded message said someone would be right with me and no one ever answered. After almost ten minutes on the phone I gave up. Writing this review so maybe the management can see there is a problem when they won't answer the phone. Would really like to recommend this hotel and would like to stay there next year when we are at the same convention. Have to wait and see...</p><br></body></html>
