<html><head><h3>Tahiti Vacation Club Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 9</h3></head><body><br>So so.... there are better timeshares around...<p>As a timeshare owner of Wyndham, this is much lower class of vacation property. We were traveling with 6 adults and needed 3 bedrooms with kitchen.
I cancelled "Desert Rose" to reserve this one - not sure if that was good idea.
Rooms were older and showed some wear but OK. The shuttle to strip is only once per hour. We had to wait long time for the shuttle because the bus was full.
I probably will choose another place to stay next time.</p><br>Absolutely fabulous<p>This was our second time in Vegas having previously stayed at the palazzo...decided to stay off the strip this time and chose the tahiti ...so glad we did...the rooms were great,pool area was tranquil and peaceful , staff were great and very accommodating..Our room was immaculate and our queen sized bed was amazing..never felt so rested,we had a lock out adjoining suite . The complimentary breakfast of bagels and muffins was very much appreciated. The free shuttle bus was an absolute godsend..would definitely stay here again and recommend it to anyone looking for a peaceful escape from the busy hectic pace of the Vegas strip .10 out of 10 from us.</p><br>An excellent value for Las Vegas<p>I paid about $70 per night for a very nice studio with an well-appointed kitchenette. The only problem with the room was that I could hear people in the adjacent room and one night they came in at 4am and were pretty drunk. Otherwise, the room is very comfortable, large and offers an excellent value. Sean, the concierge, was particularly helpful in finding discounted tickets for some of the shows that I wanted to see. Overall, a very good experience.</p><br>Great vacation at Tahiti<p>I stayed at Tahiti between may 7-14 in a one bedroom unit with a view of the pool. The staff was very accommodating, and the best part was the shuttle that took me shopping, downtown, and the strip.
I throughly enjoyed my stay there.</p><br>First time in Vegas....Glad we stayed off the strip!<p>Our party of 4 stayed in a 2BR suite from April 25th-May2nd and we had a blast. The rooms were GREAT, the staff were even better than that! We loved that it was off the strip a little away from the madness. The rooms were very clean, spacious, and the beds are to die for! Not sure what kind of beds they have but I WANT ONE! The pools were awesome along with the hot tub. The ONLY thing I could recommend is that maybe the hot tub be a little hotter. Other than that our stay was perfect. We drove to the Grand Canyon and stopped at the Hoover Dam on the way back to Vegas. Took a short drive to California as well. We loved the rooms Jacuzzi tubs in both bathrooms, the washer and dryer and the full kitchen as we cooked in most days. Another bonus is the 3 grills outside for your use with 2 mini refrigerators right next to them...brilliant idea :) I read all the reviews before I came here and I have to say that any negative comments said about Tahiti truly must come from someone who has nothing better to do than to conjure up things to complain about. It's nice, clean, bug free, safe, comfortable and we would come back in a minute! Blessings to all, The Smaagaards
Room Tip: We had a room in building C and it was a great view of the pool, hot tub and easy parking. Loved it

The person checking me in was new to the task but had a great attitude and worked through the process. The room was fine, clean and roomy. My only real complaint with the facilities themselves was water temperature. The temperature was never above about 85-90 degrees Fahrenheit, a bit on the tepid side for a shower. That temperature might be fine on a 110 degree day in Las Vegas but not on a 70 degree day.

The biggest issue with this facility is its isolation. There is not much close to the hotel, so if you do not have a car or do not want to ride a shuttle to the strip the options for food and services are extremely limited.</p><br>Almost Perfect<p>We came back from Las Vegas, NV this morning (12:45 am our plane landed). We stayed a week at Tahiti Vacation Club, in a 1 bedroom suite. The suite we stayed in was spacious, clean, comfortable, fully furnished with a fully equipped kitchen. There was no problem with bugs or cleanliness. In the middle of our stay they cleaned our room, replaced the dirty towels and changed the bed sheets in the bedroom. I found it perfectly located in Las Vegas, less than 3 miles from the Vegas strip on Tropicana Avenue. Easy access to I-15 and other major roads. The Club provides shuttle to the strip, downtown, grocery shopping, so you don't really need a vehicle IF you want to stay in the area. We did have a rental car (EZ-Rent) and travelled outside of Las Vegas. Although they provided breakfast we ate there only once. Although I didn't expect too much from this breakfast, it would have been nice to have more choices, such as yogurt, milk, fruits, other than apples. On the morning when we ate there it was bagels and muffins. Having a full kitchen in the unit gave us flexibility of the time we wanted to eat and we were able to eat whatever we wanted after we picked up some breakfast items at Walmart Supercentre.
The bathroom was big enough for the two of us with 2 sinks a spacious shower and a Jacuzzi tub (and of course a toilet). Shampoo, soap is supplied by the Club.

The one thing that would have made it perfect if the balcony was looking onto the pool area. I felt it was weird sitting outside on the balcony looking onto the parking lot at the shopping centre next door.

we didn't use the pool but it looked very nice.

Some suggestions for the management (if they read it).
- a nightlight in the bathroom would be nice. I had to keep a hallway light on at night because the room was very dark when we turned the lights off and closed the curtains. The room looked to the east so I had to close the curtains.
- a handle bar in the shower would be a safe bet, I slipped, but not fell, a few times and there was nothing to hang onto when washing my feet in the shower. Also a small shelf to put the shampoo and soap on. I had to keep them on the shower floor.
- 2 separate switches in the bathroom to control the lights because I didn't need all 4 lights on just washing my teeth or face.
Room Tip: If you get a room with a balcony ask for one that looks onto the pools. I didn't use our balcony...
See more room tips</p><br>positive experience<p>We live only two hrs north of Las Vegas so this was our second stay within a 3 month time frame.

Our 1 bd, room suite was very comfortable ,clean and roomy. This facility is just off the strip and has a relaxed feel not the hustle and bustle you would expect in a Las Vegas experience.

Staff were very friendly and accommodating.</p><br>great place<p>stayed there for 2 days but would have stayed longuer if i would had more time. The room was really clean and spacious. the pools was great and it was really quiet... the continal breakfast was ok but lacking of choises...

the only set back was that i had requested a non smoking room but the room beside us was smoking and the smell came throught the adjacent door that was in our rooms.. we had to put towels arround the door to stop the smell from coming in... If i would have stayed longuer, i would had asked for another room that's for sure... but except that it was a really great stay</p><br>Very nice stay!<p>Our room was on the S. end of the resort on the second floor. It was nice, modern, clean, and roomy, with a slight feel of Polynesia. We had all the amenities of a nice time share, in this one bedroom unit, including a jacuzzi bath tub, full size fridge, laundry, etc. The room even has a safe. It had the personal toiletries of a nice hotel, plus the first use items you need for laundry & dishwasher. The location was just a couple minutes from the Orleans and we had friends to meet at the Mandalay Bay, Caesars, & Bellagio, which took around 10 to 13 minutes to get to each of them. Parking was very easy and they had a nice pool area with a couple pools. Our only real negative was that the breakfast was just plain bagels, cream cheese, bananas, apples, crystal light, and coffee, All in all, a great stay!</p><br></body></html>
