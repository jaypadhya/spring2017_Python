<html><head><h3>Tahiti Vacation Club Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 20</h3></head><body><br>Not a bad place!<p>We stayed at Tahiti from February 27 - March 7, 2010. The place was very quiet at the beginning of the week and then as the weekend approached got a little bit busy. John at the front desk was great and did whatever he could to accomodate us. The pool and hot tub area are very nice. There is a Walgreens and a couple of restaurants within walking distance, and don't overlook the Orleans...they have a reasonably priced cafe.</p><br>Good value for money, but not up to 3 star quality<p>I stayed 3 nights at this hotel, and I decided to stay here for the price and location. The rooms were a bit tired, and my room had a connecting door with another room, so I could hear their TV on until past midnight.
One thing I liked about its location is that there are good choices of restaurants within walking distance next to the hotel. The hotel is 5 minutes by car to the Strip.
Expect to pay extra for internet connection.</p><br>Nice hotel but had 2 issues.......<p>We already knew they don't change the towels daily which is fine, I don't want shady people in my room anyway.
Our room was nice and quiet, overlooked the pool.
The free breakfast was crappy but can you complain about free? They do use the breakfast to try to get you buy a timeshare, so beware. We did tour their other timeshare for free show tickets or 2 day rental car, we went with the rental car. Budget was terrible but that could be a separate review for another time. Sure enough 3 months later Budget sent us a bill saying Tahiti never paid for the rental car. I went crazy on the Budget representative b/c our experience at the Vegas rental location was TERRIBLE so they refunded the money.
Also while laying out at the pool on EASTER SUNDAY with kids everywhere some lady decided to take her top off. We told the front desk who of coarse did NOTHING. I mean it's Vegas but still, there were little kids there, and it was EASTER!
So I would stay again w/o children and w/o taking any tour of their other resorts!</p><br>I want to go back there again!<p>Tahiti resort was AWESOME !, We had a "Deluxe Suite" on the top (3rd) Floor, and it was just FANTASTIC in my opionion. Rooms are large, FULL kitchen with everything you need except for food in the fridge...plates, silverware, kitchen utinsels, cups, glasses and everything were INCLUDED down to a corkscrew for that bottle of wine!
The room was VERY QUIET, and EXTREMLEY CLEAN !..the bed was VERY COMFORTABLE and you just did not want to get up. The girlfriend LOVED the Jetted tub and after walking Vegas from one end to the other, I will agree it was Fantastic.

We are already planning to return here again, because it is a GREAT deal for what you get.</p><br>Great Place For A Family<p>this place was much better then i was expecting for the price. check in was really easy. they allowed us to check in about 2 hours early and there was no pressure for a time share presentation. the front desk called minutes after we got there to make sure the room was ok and we had everything we needed. we were there with small children and they were able to accomodate our request for a ground floor room. we were there for 3 nights and it was probably some of the best sleep i have had in las vegas. the room itself was quite large. we had a 2 bedroom. 1 bedroom with a pull out couch and a 2nd lock off studio suite. kitchen was roomy and well stocked. even the lock of suite had ample kitchen ammenities. bed was comfortable and the bathroom was large with double sinks and a jetted tub (also in the lock off). the resort is small more of a hotel then a resort but the ammenities we took advantage of were great. they had gas grills which we used to cook dinner one night and two good size swimming pools and a hot tub in the courtyard with plenty of seating. although it was february one of the pools was heated and warm enough to swim which was a nice surprise. often times 'heated pool' still are too cold to enjoy! there was plenty of shade which would be key for the summer time. the shuttle was an added bonus. it stopped at the orleans, tropicana & treasure island. although the ride back was a bit frustrating since it makes not only the above mentioned stops but also goes to their sister property club soelei (spelling??) further up the same road. it may not sound like that big of a deal but you basically go right past you property and make a big loop to get to the other property & then it make two stops at that resort. without small children we would have just got off and walked from the orleans but at night with kids i would feel a bit uncomfortable. there is a smiths and an albertsons just a bit further up on tropicana which is must to save money on food and alcohol. be sure to ask housekeeping for extra trash bags/dishwashing detergent/laundry detergent/coffee etc when you see then since you will not have housekeeping unless you pay an additional charge or stay for more then a week. certainly not a big deal for us but know what you are getting into. all in all we got way more then we expected for the price (about $115/night for a 2bdrm over president's day/valentine's day weekend) & are already planning on going back--soon!</p><br>trip to a wedding<p>We have a timeshare with the same company. We were able to exchange to this one just to experience a different ambience. Liked it. We were only there for 4 days. We didn't really get to explore what activities they had to offer for the kids, but would go there again.</p><br>A wonderful place to relax in busy Las Vegas<p>We stayed here to break the night from Utah to Los Angeles. The hotel was wonderfully priced and we were very surprised about how nice it was. The room was very spacious and clean. The furniture looked new. The bathroom had a big tub with jets. Everything had a tropical theme. The pool area is very nice with one heated and one non-heated pool and a jacuzzi. The heated pool had one part which had sand on the bottom. Though it was January, the water was warm enough to go swimming. The free breakfast consists of toast, jelly, tiny Danishes, coffee and tea. Though the hotel is pretty far from the Strip, there is a free shuttle that takes you there and back.</p><br>Nice place to stay away from the hustle of the strip.<p>I stayed here one night. The room was very nice, with a kitchenette and clean bed and bath. The neighborhood had plenty of eating options within walking distance or a quick drive. The service at the hotel was excellent. After checking in, I received a follow up call from the front desk making sure everything was okay. That's a first for me.

I was at the hotel in winter, so I missed some of the perceived highlights of the grounds, namely all the pools in the middle of the complex. My only gripe with what I was able to use was with the TV. The doors to the TV cabinet only opened 90 degrees, so you had to watch straight on. But that's hardly enough to worry about. If you want to stay away from the strip in a nice hotel for pretty cheap, I recommend this hotel.</p><br>Lovely place to stay<p>Hubby & I just returned from a 4 day trip to LV. Our stay at Tahiti couldn't be better. The staff was very friendly and responsive (our fireplace wasn't coming on when we arrived in our room and I think they had a serviceman knocking on our door before I'd even hung up the phone with the front desk!).
Our room (the 1 BR with LV, full size kitchen and balcony overlooking the pool), was clean and located just where I'd asked for when I called the front desk a couple days before our arrival. The location gives quick access to any of the highways or major roads around the city. A shuttle service is available, but we had a rental car. We used the shuttle once when we picked it up at the Tropicana for a ride up to Treasure Island to pick up our car after spending an afternoon working our way down the strip by foot. (Don't miss the 'perfect' margarita at Margaritaville at the Flamingo!). The ride was pretty quick and the driver was full of great suggestions around town.
Overall, we found no major issues with this resort and we'd definitely stay here again - it's not a big, huge resort, but if you want access to all that Vegas has to offer, but also a place to chill out at - I highly recommend the Tahiti (not to be confused with it's sister resort, the Tahiti VILLAGE which is located south of Mandalay Bay and near the airport on South Las Vegas Blvd).</p><br>Clean,Quiet, close to the strip.<p>We stayed here for an ESPN golf tournament at the Paiute Golf club.We are two guys in our early 60s. The resort was perfect for our needs. Just outside of the strip and easy for us to drive around town and avoid the traffic. The resort has BQ grills, and the Hot tubs were great for our aching backs after 36 holes of golf each day. There is a Dennys restaurant next door and Supermarkets, Pharmacy, many restaurants walking distance form this resort. We stayed in a one bedroom with a pull out couch in the living room area and two nice size tvs. It worked out great for us. The airport was only about 15/20 min away. The resort is close to all the major highways. We took a trip to Mesquite on the Nevada/ Utah border near Zion National park. It was 88 miles away and about 90 min by car.</p><br></body></html>
