<html><head><h3>Tahiti Vacation Club Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 24</h3></head><body><br>Good, but not Fantastic<p>We just returned from the Tahiti. The staff is very friendly and helpful. The location is good if you don't mind being a little off the strip. The shuttle service is usually great with an occasional hitch. We requested an accessible unit, but one was not available. The one bedroom unit that we did get worked for my electric scooter though. Problems included a bed that was a little hard with skinny pillows and glass doors on the jaccuzi tub that made entry a little difficult. We attended the timeshare pitch and were not kept overly long when we made it very clear that we did not intend to buy.</p><br>Left Hanging<p>The resort was clean and well kept, however when a friend and I arrived the bell hop saw us and promptly went off duty. We were not offered any help with our bags and had to enter up many steps to our building lugging very heavy luggage. This was not the welcome I expected.</p><br>Maybe they treat owners better?<p>I stayed at Tahiti April 19-26 ,2006 and it was ok at best. There was no assistance wth my bags whatsoever. My sister's an owner and traded a week of her time with interval International and i paid 168.00 fee as non owner fee. I was put in lock out which was ok but no stove. The apartment next door was huge. When I asked for a change I was told to call the next day. Since my wife didn't want to cook anyway ,I didn't pursue issue. I had a feeling the staff was forced to be nice, not genuine. I could have stayed a the strip and had equal or better accomadations. Definitely skip the free gift. Overall nice place if you can get it cheap.</p><br>Nice alternative to 'The Strip'<p>I stayed at the Tahiti Vacation Club with my 10 & 13 year-old daughters and my husband. We had a large, two bedroom suite. For us, the location was perfect, as we wanted a little respite from the strip chaos. The rooms were great- spacious and nicely appointed. Beds were comfortable. The service was also excellent. Our every request-- additional towels, laundry soap, etc. was responded to promptly and pleasantly. Chairs at the pool were plentiful and always available. The only drawback to the pool area was the tahitian-themed pool music which began early in the morning and stayed on late through the evening. Our rooms overlooked the pool area, so it became a little annoying. The only significant negative to our one-week stay was the army of timeshare salespeople and their "prospects" that swarmed the pool and lobby area. They were friendly, but sometimes you didn't feel like greeting ten people every five feet and having to make small-talk and push through the crowds to get to the elevator. All-in-all, we would stay here again.</p><br>Nice place to stay--a little noisy<p>My husband and I stayed at the Tahiti resort for a week in January, 2006. We are timeshare members and we traded a week to stay here. It was a great place to stay, but as said in previous reviews--it is noisy. We stayed in a one bedroom unit. It was very spacious and clean. The only complaint I have is the noise. The walls and ceilings are thin. The breakfast in the mornings was a nice touch. Just a basic set-up each morning with some danishes and coffee. The resort is in a good location. Easy to find and easy access to the strip. We rented a car during our stay and it worked out nicely.</p><br>Great place to stay in Vegas<p>I stayed at Tahiti Vacation Club for one night over Halloween weekend. Tahiti was cheaper than any hotel on or near the Strip (this weekend is particularly crowded and expensive.) My studio suite was spacious, very clean and had all of the amenities that I would look for if I were staying more than one night. The kitchen area was well stocked, the bed was comfortable, and the shower was excellent. The hotel is exactly 2 miles from New York-New York and there is a free shuttle that runs every hour (until 1:30 am on the weekends.) My only complaint is I woke up several times during the night because of noise from the hallway and upstairs. The ceiling and walls are not very thick! I would recommend running the fan to drown out some of the noise. I will definitely stay here again!</p><br>Great Resort just off the strip<p>We just got back from a three night stay at the Tahiti and were very pleased with the stay. The entire resort is immaculate and the staff is very friendly. They have two sand bottom swimming pools with a relaxing water fountain in between. After staying in hotels on the strip and having to trek through a smoky, noisy casino to get to your room, the Tahiti offers a nice reprieve just off the strip. As mentioned there are frequent shuttles to the strip so getting there is not a problem. There are also numerous bars and restaurants within walking distance.</p><br>great choice<p>My girlfriends and I stayed here for a week in December and we totally loved it! The resort is a short drive from the strip but from our experience you need a car to truly explore vegas. We rented a car at the airport and checked-in to a fabulous suite. The decor is beautiful and the pools are lovely. Families and groups of friends will enjoy their stays. You definitely need a car to get around b.c the shuttle service -----. The complimentary breakfast is not great but you can eat on the strip and if you are like me you will sleep through that and eat a fabulous lunch not to mention you have a fridge so you can stock up on your favorite breakfast treats to save $ and use that for your meals because you will need the $ b/c vegas resturants are not cheap as most people make you believe. Overall, the property is great nice staff and plenty to do nearby</p><br>Nice place to stay away from the Strip<p>We just returned from spending five days at the Tahiti in Las Vegas. This is a beautiful resort with two nice swimming pools. Our room was cleaned to perfection! We had a two bedroom unit which was lovely and had a nice view of the pool.

The only complaint I have with the Tahiti is the rooms are not sound proof. We were woke up by our neighbors --crying children and angry parents -- two mornings in a row. We tried staying in the other bedroom -- we could hear their telephone conversations as if they were in our room.

The staff was friendly and the continental breakfast was adequate. It is nice to have a coffee pot and coffee in your room each morning.

We prefer to stay off the Strip where we can get away from the action for a few hours so this was perfect for us. We would recommend the Tahiti.</p><br>great place<p>everything about the Tahiti is great...location,near eating places,gas stations,drug stores!
Clean,clean,clean.......however the beds are thin mattresses on a wooden platforms....backache after third night.

Get the Deluxe two bedroom of you have teens, they love having their "own apartment" with private entrance.

Highly recommend....Consolidated Properties have a lot of great properties in Vegas and Hawaii.</p><br></body></html>
