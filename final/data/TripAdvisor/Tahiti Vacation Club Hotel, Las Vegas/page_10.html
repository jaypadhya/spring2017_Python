<html><head><h3>Tahiti Vacation Club Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 10</h3></head><body><br>I don't recommend it.<p>Not a nice experience. The cleaning smell in the front lobby and the hallway made me ill. Upon entering the lobby I was assured that the smell was only in the lobby because people smoke near the front door and they have an air freshener. NOT. It was in the hallway near our room as well. In fact, it permeated our living room and kitchen area also. When I contacted the front desk to complain I was told that the carpet had been cleaned the day before. As our stay continued, the odor was worse, hard to believe it was the carpet. I spoke with maintenance and he told me that he would change the filters but he thought the smell was being piped in through the vents. The front desk staff seemed rather inept, made a lot of excuses and appeared unable to take corrective action. There were 2 decorative bushes in the room that were dusty and filthy. I asked maintenance to remove one from our bedroom. The bottom sheet didn't fit on the bed properly. The lightbulb in the livingroom was missing and there appeared to be mold growth between some of the shower tiles. Even the toilet paper and tissue smelled like the chemicals in the hallway. I found it rather unsanitary that the toilet paper and the tissue was stored under the bathroom counter near the toilet plunger! Clearly we would not stay here again.</p><br>Excellent Stay<p>We traveled to Vegas and stayed at the Tahiti during the long Presidents day weekend in Feb. Check-in was a breeze as we got there around 11:00 pm. This was our second stay at this property and would recommend it to anyone that wants a clean comfortable place to stay.

We had a 2 bedroom condo for 2 couples, 1 teenager and it was perfect. There were 2 full bathrooms in each room. The middle has a large living area with a fireplace. The kitchen has a regular size stove, fridge, microwave etc. We like that there is a washer and dryer to do laundry. Since airlines now charge for most bags, we can bring less and till have clean clothes each day.

There is a nice heated pool and great hot tub!! We actually used them this time even in February!

The staff was very friendly and made us feel welcomed everywhere we went. Checkout was a breeze and again a friendly smile from the front desk.

If you want to have a clean room with excellent amenities, I would recommend checking out this property, I don't think you will be disappointed. We will be back next year and plan to stay at the Tahiti again.
Room Tip: Rooms on the higher floors seem quieter
See more room tips</p><br>one night stay<p>We just left a pair of shoes in the closet and had to call two times about them I have to ask my boyfriend what was the results. Other than that I will stay here every time I come to Vegas. The room gave a home effect I loved the fireplace and the large tub.</p><br>Great pool, very clean, tons of space!!<p>Great pools, rooms are very spacious! Staff was very helpful at the front desk. Very clean. Only two miles from the strip and we never got a car because the shuttle is great! Quiet yet we hung out late at the hot tub! Second time there and will go back again! Stayed 5 days and they upgraded up from a studio to a 1 bedroom wooo hooo! Was ground level and it was great!
Room Tip: I like to face the pool...
See more room tips</p><br>Smells great, only on the first 2 days.<p>Ok my first impressions where great and if I had based my stay on those 2 days I would give this place a 5 dot rating, but we stayed here for 6 nights.
Staff nice enough but they weren't go getters. Management non responsive.

As always I do the pro's first then the con's.

So here are the pro's very spacious for a 2 bedroom suite, kitchen for it's age (don't actually know how old it is) was very well maintained, appliances in great order had all you needed for a self contained stay. Loved the fact that we had our own laundry facilities in the suite.
Both rooms had King beds and plenty of plates and cutlery to eat on.
The pools where great pity about the weather so we only enjoyed them for 2 days.
The shuttle to a fro was great!
There is no room service unless you stay for 7 nights or more. However there where ample towels ect. for our duration.

The con's.
After the 2nd night we noticed in the morning a odd smell in the room our kids where staying in ( having to close the windows over night so they could get to bed at a reasonable time because of the loud annoying music the hotel insisted on playing around the pool area till 11pm) we discovered that their room smelt of old stale cigarette smell.
So the fresh aroma we smelt upon arrival was a big cover up for the foul smell that usually stagnates.
I know I am being harsh know but I feel ripped off, this persisted for the whole duration of the stay, however we did notice the spray or chemical they used to cover the smell had some kind of reaction with fresh air and after a day airing out it was fine for the evening sleep only to return in the morning (the only way to get old tobacco smoke out is to replace the OLD DATED CARPETS no rocket scientist need's to figure that out.
The weekend arrived and with that another problem surfaced the thickness of the walls between us and next door neighbours, we as well as they I am sure could here our whole conversation with absolute clarity.

Ok lets talk about the pre-set music, it comes on at around 8am and it dose not end till 11pm so yes lets do the maths, 15hours of repetitive music around the pool area all day long, 7 days a week I don't think management are even around, this is pure torture.
I know they are trying to amulet 'Tahiti' but have these guys actually been?


One other thing that got up our noses was the lack of internet connection this was awful non existent and very important to us as we are on a some what of a sabbatical with our children we need this for them to continue their studies, we approached front desk staff but nothing was done day in day out the manager seemed to be out each time we enquired frustrating!!!

Would I stay there again no, it also is not that close to strip but it dose have that shuttle.
Room Tip: I don't think this place is design very well there are a few rooms facing the pool area however...
See more room tips</p><br>Wonderful resort..............<p>Off the strip. Wonderful pool. Condos with full kitchen, w/d, large bath. Suttle to strip. Wonderful resort. Great people. Romantic. But also good for families. Would live there if I could.

First time at resort.
Room Tip: Over looking pool...
See more room tips</p><br>We would stay here again.<p>The pictures do not really do this place justice, it is actually very pretty and the suite we stayed in was really nice. The staff is really friendly and the price was right, and I would like to note that everything was clean. We found no roaches, and were very satisfied. The staff was very accomidating, helping us even though we were extrememly early for check in and had a late night flight the day we checked out. The only reason why this hotel did not get a 5, was because upon our departure the staff working the front desk was extremely rude, which was suprising because everyone else was great!! The shuttle to the strip is a nice ammenity, however the last shuttle of the night is at 11:30 pm or at 1:30 am on Fridays and Saturdays. The only other downfall was lack of wi-fi, but we could make do without it.
Room Tip: The two bedroom suite was very nice. It has a full kitchen and was stocked with bakeware, glasses...
See more room tips</p><br>Second time at The Club<p>We stayed in April of this year and we had a good time so we stayed here again in October. October 12th to 17th to be exact.
We had the one bedroom suite, same as last time. I requested an early check-in and I wasn't surprised when we got there around noon and no rooms were clean yet. No problem, went to The Orleans Casino which is a two minute drive east from Tahiti and had lunch and then to the grocery store which is a major intersection west of Tahiti for some room supplies.
Came back at 2 PM and were checked in to room 116 as promised.
When we first get into a hotel room we basically tear it apart looking for signs of bedbugs. I am happy to report none were found. We even take the headboard off and none were found. There was an insect behind the headboard but definitely not a bed bug.
The one sitting chair in the bedroom had quite a bit of dust that collected between the cushion and the armrest which was kind of disappointing as the first room we stayed was spotless.
The suite was well appointed with a large screen TV in both the bedroom and the living room. A fully equipped kitchen with a full size refrigerator, stove and dishwasher. We also had a small washer and dryer in the room.
The problem started when we noticed a cockroach in the kitchen. I told one of the workers and I was told that cockroaches were a problem in the hotel. He said that they would spray when we left the room for the day. When we got back, a note was left in our kitchen saying they were there that day and sprayed.
I kept an eye out for roaches the rest of our stay and none showed up till later in the week. One showed up from under the couch and one from somewhere in the kitchen. I went to the front desk and they were very supportive and offered to move us. We declined, but sealed up our suit cases and bagged all of our clothes. We shook out everything before we came home and washed and dried right away upon our return home. It's been 10 days since we got home and I haven't seen one yet.
Tahiti is a quiet place to stay in Vegas, well away from busy and noisy Strip.
The only complaint I had other then the roaches was the pool music. It is playing all the time, even during the night when no one is using the pool area. They did turn it down when I called the front desk to complain when we tried to sleep. We keep the window open for some fresh air in the room when we sleep so the music was not appreciated.
There is no dining options at Tahiti, but there is a Denny's, a Quizno's and a Papa John Pizzeria which made the worst pizza I have ever had when we picked one up for dinner one night.
There is no Gambling either, but The Orleans is very close.
Room Tip: If driving, be careful when turning right on to West Tropicana out of the property.
See more room tips</p><br>Absolutely Disgusted<p>I travel quite a bit, and have stayed at Tahiti before and let me say that this will be the last time I stay there. The resort itself is okay, but the front desk staff is childish, unprofessional, and have no sense of common courtesy whatsoever. The girl in the morning did nothing but give me attitude. The two younger girls were absolutely horrible. They were running around the lobby like little children as the phones were ringing and I was standing at the front desk waiting to ask a question. Then when they finally decided to come back to the desk, I was given nothing but attitude like I had just killed their fun. Then when speaking with the male manager, it was like speaking to a wall who liked to roll their eyes and make me feel like I was stupid. I don't feel that that's the way you should be treated when you go stay somewhere, especially from someone in management. The only person who was nice to me was Alli. She worked at night mostly, but was the only one to help me out with no attitude whatsoever. Thank you
Alli. This was my first time back in about a year, and the staff they had the last time I was there was amazing and always very helpful with big smiles, but this time around.....I would definitely consider never coming back if that's how I'm going to be treated.</p><br>Average Hotel, No Bar Onsite, Old Crowd<p>We are owners at the Tahiti Village resort on Las Vegas Blvd; so when I learned of thier sister resort we decided to check it out (Tahiti Village was sold out). Tahiti Vacation Club is a $30 cab ride from the strip (with tip). The shuttle buses from the airport wont even go out to Tahiti Vacation Club because it is REALLY far from the strip! There is no bar onsite which was a huge bummer, and there is litterally nothing there but the hotel (no restaurant, no casino, nothing). I would say the average age at Tahiti Vacation Club is 75, and their daily activities are perfect for them...walking club, pool arobics, etc. The chubby girl at the front desk was SUPER rude and disrepectful to other customers. But both of the younger guys at the front desk were really nice. The shuttle bus only runs until midnight so we had to pay for a taxi every night to get back to the hotel. The rooms are really run down and both our room and our friends room had the hot/cold water mixed around which was annoying. Tahiti Village Resort is a way better place to stay. We will definitely not be back to Tahiti Vacation Club!
Room Tip: stay on the strip or at Tahiti Village Resort on Las Vegas Blvd
