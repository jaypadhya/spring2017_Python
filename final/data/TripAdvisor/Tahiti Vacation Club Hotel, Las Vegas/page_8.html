<html><head><h3>Tahiti Vacation Club Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 8</h3></head><body><br>Great location and clean!<p>From the moment we walked through the doors we knew the Tahiti Vacation Club was a good choice for our Relaxing Girl's Weekend. The front desk staff was efficient and friendly and the lobby was clean and gave off that tropical vibe without being overkill. Our room was perfect - clean, large bathroom, very clean, well supplied kitchen, extremely clean, and a gorgeous pool view! Did I mention how clean it was?

The location is about 4 miles from the Las Vegas action. Far enough to get away from the noise and craziness, close enough to get to the noise and craziness. We were thrilled to relax by the wonderful pool (part of it had a sandy bottom, so cool!) and were pleasantly surprised at the complimentary breakfast goodies. (Generic but complimentary non-the-less).

We would definitely return to the Tahiti Vacation Club.

The third party entity's understanding of the resort's room types isn't actually what the resort offers. This was disappointing, to say the least. We were pleasantly surprised when Eva, Executive Housekeeper knocked on our door and asked if we still were moving to the rooms we thought we reserved. We informed Eva that we would like to move. Eva left and a few minutes later returned along with Roy, the General Manager. Roy apologized (not his fault, nor the Resort's) and provided us with the upgraded rooms. Needless to say, we are very happy with this outstanding customer service provided by both Roy and Eva. With the General Manager personally delivering the new room keys and discussing the issue is a testament to the importance of providing the best customer service possible for the issue at hand. A job well done Roy and Eva! Your actions will not be forgotten and we will tell family and friends of your excellent accommodations and customer service. Thank you again!</p><br>Great Value! Love the pools!<p>Me and my wife stayed here Aug11-18. Must say very impressed! Rooms were clean, friendly staff, and the pools were amazing! We usually stay at the Club de Soleil but decided to change it up, what I also like is they don't hassle, and Annoy with time-share like most others on Vegas. Would def. Stay here again!</p><br>Watch out for your credit cards<p>I do want to start out by saying that I loved the room. Very clean and modern. My issue started after my vacation. I was charged for an extra night and it took several calls for get the 100 deposit back. Ashley was helpful and apologetic but even she couldn't give me a reason why my reservation was changed to another day. I would suggest using a prepaid card for the reservation and the deposit.</p><br>Staff was exellent and our room was impeccable loved everything about it<p>I rented a 1 bedroom on 2 floor it was very clean , the staff were exellent, the grounds were impeccable working always to keep it tidey , the pools were great . Everything about this resort was exellent the shuttle to the strip , if you don't have a car they shuttle you to the grocery store . The wifi is not good but that will come , I wasn't there to be on my computer or phone so as for wifi I have confidence that they will have it up and running anytime soon but u can get it in the lobbey. I would give this resort thumbs up diffently a10. I'll will be returning for sure</p><br>Disappointed- from a unfussy traveler<p>First let me say this---I am a very unfussy traveler and have never given a bad review before. I am an owner of Marriott Surf Club timeshare and we trade in almost every year, traveling to many different places.
We traded in our Marriott timeshare and stayed here for a week last month. My 25 year old son arrived first and checked us in. He had a lot of work to do while waiting for us to arrive and got right to it. Only to find out this place has NO WIFI in the rooms or the "business center" and very weak wifi in the lobby. He ended up spending a good part of the first 2 days at the very crowded and noisy Starbucks down the street doing work. This is Vegas---who doesn't have wifi for their guests??? We were counting on using the internet to find deals on shows and dinners too.

We needed a unit comparable in size to our 2 bedroom Marriott, that has sleeping accommodations for 8 adults. So we booked the Deluxe 2 bedroom. He was given a very small 2 bedroom unit (not one of the deluxe rooms) on the 3rd floor looking at the back of the shopping center next door. The hotel was far from being full, as the parking lot and pool were pretty empty the entire week. When we arrived, I called the front desk to inquire about the deluxe vs regular 2 bedroom and was asked to bring my confirmation to them to prove I reserved the deluxe room. Really the only difference is that the deluxe has another sofa bed, which we needed. Pretty shabby to make me prove it by bringing my confirmation to them. I mean this place was less than half full---why not just take my word for it and move us?? Which is what we did after all.

2nd room was bigger with another sofa bed, both of which were horrible to sleep on. The kitchen and master bedroom part smelled like an old, dirty aquarium. I called housekeeping and they came and sprayed the carpets for me. This seemed to take care of the smell for the week.

Many other things were wrong with this place--2nd bedroom shower door broken, faucet in master bathtub did not work so we could only shower not use the tub, gym was the barest I've ever seen.

Noise from unit upstairs --running and jumping until 2 in the morning--carried like they were in our room with us.</p><br>loved tahiti vacation club<p>We want to say what a great place to stay, everything from the front staff to housekeeping to the management everyone treated us with 5 star service. The one bedroom we had was clean was good size it had everything in it. The Suttle service was so convenient we used it everyday.
We will recommend tahiti vacation club to everyone. I give them a perfect 10 plus</p><br>Great Place to Vacation, but no Wi Fi<p>Stayed at this resort for 2 weeks, absolutely loved the room, the resort, the pool, the staff, the free breakfast. Have stayed in a few others but love the smaller nature of this, sometimes we had the pool to ourselves, there were not too many rules or other people around, you can take your drinks and food to the pool, staff were friendly and helpful, rooms are the same as Tahiti Village, location is an easy 5 minute drive to the strip, the shuttle is great and never too busy. All the local amenities are within 2 minute drive. The only downfall is the WiFi, if this place had good WiFi I would buy a unit and move in, even some sort of paid WiFi would be alright. WiFi is an absolute necessity in this day and age, even our AT&T coverage was awful here couldn't get reception indoors. But apart from that love the place.</p><br>Absolutely Wonderful!<p>This is our third time staying at Tahiti and, needless to say, we love it and we love Vegas.

Our check-in was easy and efficient despite the fact that we arrived at 1:00 when check-in is at 4:00. We upgraded from a studio to a one-bedroom unit and it was no problem at all. We didn't get a room facing the pool, but I understood that as we had just upgraded. The woman at the desk seemed to be new, but she was not shy about getting the manager's help right away. The whole thing took about 15 minutes.

Our unit was just as we remembered and expected it to be...very clean and stocked with all kitchen utensils, towels, pool towels, and everything else we could possibly need. We were provided with one box of laundry detergent and one pack of dishwasher detergent, which were restocked halfway through our stay when housekeeping came in. The only thing we did not see and, if we missed it, that's our fault, but we could have used a pizza cutter since we bought a frozen pizza at Walmart for one night's dinner.

The pools were great and, oh, did I mention the hot tub? Heaven on earth. If you sit under the waterfall, your shoulders get a nice massage too. The pools were clean and the temperatures were absolutely perfect. The pools were never crowded as this is a calmer and quieter resort than, say, Tahiti Village. There were tables and, I guess you could call them, cabanas where you could stay out of the sun in addition to a lot of sunny areas.

The BBQs got a lot of use and I was happy to see that. There was a nice group of guys there that were cooking up a storm! We started out with the best intention of using the BBQs, but then, somehow, we ran out of time and just hastily cooked inside.

We slept like babies. Everything was very comfy.

Don't plan on spending time on your iPad or handheld devices though as we couldn't even get our hot spot to work in the room. It was explained that they were in between providers or something, but it didn't make too much sense to me. Any emailing or Facebooking was done outside the resort. It was a bit frustrating, but then we figured we shouldn't be on our devices that much anyway. If you do have to get work done while you're there, I just wanted to put it on the review.

All in all, it was excellent and we will be back again in 49 weeks. We came out this particular week for our anniversary and my 50th birthday, but we like to vacation in June better.

Thank you, Tahiti Resort, for a great vacation.

New additions to the foyer includes a lovely little shop where you can buy deli style food for breakfast and lunch, very handy to grad for a roadtrip. The amenities include swimming pools, lazy pool, jacuzzi, bbq facilities, all very clean and nice. There are restaurants onthe premises, no need to go into the strip if you don't want to. Very close to the airport and car rental. Just far enough out of the strip to feel the quiet, but close enough to enjoy all of Vegas.
A definate return destination for our family.
Room Tip: Higher rooms are always more quiet.
