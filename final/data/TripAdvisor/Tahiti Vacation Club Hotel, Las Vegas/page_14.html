<html><head><h3>Tahiti Vacation Club Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 14</h3></head><body><br>First Las Vegas trip<p>Stayed here for 6 days in November. We had 1 bedroom and a fold out couch. Washer & Dryer in room. A small balcony overlooking the pool with a small table out there. Our room was clean, bathroom was huge. Kitchen was very nice. Staff was very helpful answering our questions about Las Vegas, giving us tips on how to get around and where to eat. Easy to get to from the airport and the strip. We did not have room service, they only clean a couple times a week with a timeshare. But when we needed more towels, soap, etc. it was readily available.</p><br>Las Vegas holiday<p>We booked two timeshares for 6 people and the rooms were wonderful. Shuttle to the strip took some figuring out but everyone was so friendly and so helpful that we would definitely go back again. The hot tub was the favourite place to be after a hard day of walking the Strip.</p><br>Nice, older resort<p>Just came back from a 5 night visit to Tahiti on Tropicana Avenue in Las Vegas. It is an older timeshare resort, but very clean, pleasantly appointed, with decent amenities. There is a nice sized pool with barbecues at one end, a small gym, and a very small convenience store. The staff was very accomodating & answered questions pleasantly and promptly. Parking is free - some covered and some not. Never had to search for a space, so there is plenty,

It is located right next door to a Denny's, so if you're tired of cooking or eating at the casinos, this is extremely convenient. There is no restaurant on-site. Just a couple doors down from the Denny's is a Walgreen's.

The shuttle to the strip runs every hour, but be careful. The destinations alternate with the shuttle going to the Orleans & New York one hour and then to the Mirage the next hour and then back to the Orleans....continuing like that all day and well into the night.

I would stay there again without any hesitation. It's a nice break from the strip and gives you the opportunity to rest.</p><br>Incredible Resort<p>We own 4 timeshare resorts, 2 Marriott's and 2 independents all highly rated. We have been timeshare owners since 1991. It is with this background that I can say, while this is not a plush resort, it is the cleanest resort we have ever stayed in. Not a bit of mold anywhere on the tile in the tub. The oven cleaner than ours at home. I believe they shampoo the hall carpets every 2 weeks. That type of thing. They have 3 gas barbeque grills. No need for a grate brush since they were extremely clean when I opened the lid. Often after checking in I have to call the front desk with a list of things that are missing or don't work. Not here! The only fault that I found with the unit is that the resort notebook was not up to date and was located in the lock off, not the main unit so did not find it until the second day. Also, my unit still had a tube type TV, but believe that they are replacing them in some of the units with HD. Half way through our week they did a complete linen and towel exchange.

I found the front desk staff, maint. staff and concierge very helpful and prompt. Checked in at 1 AM on Oct 16 and pleased at reception I received and that front desk open 24 hrs/day. Concierge very helpful in list of things to do outside of Vegas and several 2 for 1 buffet tickets. Have to go to concierge for permanent parking pass (which they really do check) but no pressure to do a presentation. When I went to the front desk to say that I could not get the barbeque grills to light, they checked out a set of tools to me and told me to return to the grills. By the time I walked back to them there was a maint. person there to help me.

In addition to the hot tub, they have a sauna in the exercise room. There is also an owners room which anyone can access with their room key. Large screen TV, coffee all day long and tables and chairs to sit at when using free WiFi. WiFi available in rooms for a fee, but they discourage you from using it since it is slow. Owners room also has large selection of brochures for attractions in the area.

While we were there they had very limited activities at the resort since the main attraction is Las Vegas. They do offer free bagels, cream cheese and coffee every day from 8 to 10 AM. In addition to the shuttle to the strip, they have a shuttle to go grocery shopping, but Albertson's grocery store is only about 1/2 mile away. We rented a car and appreciated that all of the parking was covered.

The resort is on the smaller size. It is essentially a 3 story rectangular resort with the pools in the center of the rectangle. All master units have a small patio off the living room. Were I to request a unit in advance I would ask for a second or third story unit with the patio overlooking the pool area.

Did a day trip to Zion National Park about 2 1/2 hrs. away. Highly recommend it. Rating this resort higher because of maintenance and cleanliness.
Room Tip: Were I to request a unit in advance I would ask for a second or third story unit with the patio over...

The Tahiti located 3 miles from the LV strip,had a shuttle service that left 10 minutes after the hour, stopping at the Mirage at odd hours and New York New York at even ones. One day when the shuttle arrived, it was full and six of us were told we could not get on. When we asked if another shuttle would be coming, we were told no and they were "sorry". One of the staff told me that i could call the transportation supervisor to complain. However, I was unsuccessful in my attempts to reach her. We finaly took a taxi to the strip, got a receipt and the Tahiti did reimburse us for that trip. On another occasion we took the shuttle to Town Square. It was suppose to leave at 11:30. It did not arrive until after 12:00 and when I asked why I was again told "sorry" and told that, "no one takes that shuttle anyways". After experiencing several such transportation glitches, I can only conclude that I would recommend renting a car if you don't want to be inconvenienced or frustrated.
As to the hotel itself, Wi-Fi was available in the lobby, but it was so slow it was practically non-existent. When asked about it, again the response was "sorry". It's the weather. We finally went a couple of doors down to Starbucks to get on the Internet.
Maid service at the Tahiti is offered on Wed. and Sat. In between those times you have to empty your own garbage, etc. You can get clean towels off the maid's cart and extra coffee at the front desk. They do offer a limited continental breakfast of plain bagels, cream cheese, Danish and coffee between the hours of 8 and 10.
The front desk was nice enough to print our boarding passes, which I appreciated.
Lastly, I left my LLBean toiletry bag back in the hotel bathroom as we were leaving. When I remembered it at the airport, I called the Tahiti. They were nice and took my name and address and number. I called again and again over the next two days. I was told that the maid who cleaned our room did not find a toiletry bag. While I realize it was my fault that I left this behind, I find it unbelievable that it was not found and turned in. Again the response by the Tahiti was "sorry".</p><br>Great place to stay off the strip.<p>Stayed in a two bedroom suite with another couple. Rooms were clean and well equipped. Ample covered parking space, great pool area with lovely Polynesian music, BBQ and hot tub. Ask the front desk for BBQ utensils. Complimentary continental breakfast. Really easy to get to the strip whether you drive or take the shuttle. Staff were very friendly and not pushy about the timeshare sales pitch. Would stay here again.</p><br>Mixed, more negative than positive<p>I'm somewhat comflicted on my evaluation of this property. There is both good and bad.

The good; Excellent linens, high quality. Excellent mid-week cleaning service. Virtually deserted pool area whether in the day or night, even with a "full house". Nice grills in pool area

The bad: Filthy floors, tile grout was black when the original color was almost white,carpet badly worn in several places. Old worn out furniture, couch was very uncomfortable, several tables and armoires were damaged where the plywood was showing, lots of chips and dings. Grills outside--nothing to cook with--all plastic in the unit--I used a regular fork to grill with; nothing to start the grill with--you have to turn the gas on and throw a match in it and hope you don't get blasted back more than 10 feet. Kitchen pots and pans falling apart, spartan kitchen. Wifi cost $50.95 per week. Available for free in lobby but very slow, dialup slow. A/C turns off when not in the room--that means it turns off when you are outside the room in the day; it also means it turns off at night. I would think that would be a real problem in the dead of summer when it gets to about 110 in the day and 90 at night in the desert. Bad enough in October when it gets into the 60;s or 70's at night. Some sort of motion detector keeps it on.</p><br>Relaxing place to stay.<p>Well, we're halfway through our holiday and we're very pleased with the resort. There was an initial hiccup where we were allocated a smaller lock off instead of the full one bedroom apartment that we were expecting and is the type of property that we exchanged with Interval International. The fault for this lies with Interval International and not the Tahiti because Interval International made the wrong reservation. We upgraded for the first week and initially paid a fee for this. The problem was however immediately sorted out the following morning by the desk check-in staff member Charles who allocated the correct apartment and took care of the upgrade fee.
This is where Charles and the desk team deserve a special mention. Throughout this first week he and his colleagues have consistently gone the extra mile to help us. Thanks guys, a pleasant, helpful front desk team completes the smooth running of any holiday.
The property is very clean and tidy with a well kept pool area. Pool use is 24 hour which is unusual, with a requested quiet time zone from 10pm to 7am. Free coffee, bagels and Danish are available in room 101 each morning to start the day. Free shuttles are available to the strip or a taxi ride is approximately $12-15. Plenty of covered parking for your rental car which we found to be incredibly good value. We had a Chevrolet Impala with no excess full insurance from Dollar rentacar for £260 for 14 days booked online in the UK.
Room Tip: Comfortable middle floor apartment in the middle of the East side was quiet.

The gentlemen at the front desk (Jessie? )tryed to get us a room over at the Tahiti Village but they were booked. He gave us a key to use the pool and all the facilities around the hotel we are room was ready. The pool was open 24hrs. Which was great and also had nice bbq's. The staff recommended to eat at the Black Bear dinner it was very good home cooking. The room was clean and comfortable just need to get bigger pillows.</p><br>No complaints.<p>Everything was great. Room was clean and spacious. Pool area very nice. Front desk staff polite and helpful. The shuttle service could have been better but it worked ok for us. The shuttle alternates so it only goes on each route every other hour. We got lucky and it happened to be going when we wanted to go. One time we were too tired to walk to the shuttle pick up stop so we took a taxi.</p><br></body></html>
