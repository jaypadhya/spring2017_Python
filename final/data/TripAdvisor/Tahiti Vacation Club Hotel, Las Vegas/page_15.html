<html><head><h3>Tahiti Vacation Club Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 15</h3></head><body><br>Great Resort just a short drive from The Strip<p>Stayed here in a ground floor two-bedroom suite with interconnecting door (Rooms 122 and 122a) and found the accommodation to be excellent with ample covered parking facilities close to the apartment entrance. The only downside with this particular apartment is the fact that it right beside the communal hot tub which, along with the swimming pools, are available for use by residents 24 hours per day. Almost every night there were some residents using the hot tub, sometimes until about 4.30am, right outside our bedroom window. Although they were not particularly rowdy, you could hear their continual conversations which would keep a light sleeper awake. Perhaps the management should consider closing the pool area after midnight.
The hourly courtesy bus service running from the resort to various hotels on the strip was an added bonus but the return bus to the resort is only every two hours, which is a bit of a hassle. The free breakfast, available at Room 101 from 8-10am, was basic (coffee, bagels, cream cheese, danish pastries etc) was a nice touch and there was no problem in taking these items back to your room if you so wished.
There is a free wi-fi facility in the hotel lobby with two computer and printer available in the corner but wi-fi in your apartment will cost you extra.
The policy of reserving specific sunloungers around the poolside is a little vague - we noted some people laying their towels on their favourite lounger and not returning to them for some considerable time later. I put two towels out on our preferred loungers at 8.15am one morning and, after a quick breakfast, came out to find some other residents occupying them. There was some remonstrations before we found out that the hotel staff had removed my towels shortly after I had left them. If the hotel policy is that no reservations are allowed, this should be clearly displayed around the poolside and mentioned in their literature.
There is a well-stocked Walgreens just a few steps from the hotel for topping up your fridge with the necessary refreshments and also a Denny's for breakfasts and other meals throughout the day.
I would certainly stay here again but would make sure I got an apartment further away from the hot tub!</p><br>Awesome, family friendly<p>At first we thought we were going to Tahiti Village, which is on LV Blvd, by Towne Center. This, however, is Tahiti "Vacation Club" on Tropicana. I must say my husband and 10-yr old thoroughly enjoyed this little timeshare. Parking was so convenient, the place smelled nice (like coconut) throughout the interior. The sand bottom pool was lovely (2 of them!) and it was not crowded at all, given this was Labor Day weekend. Shopping Center that includes Papa Johns (open until 3 am) delivered our pizza quickly to the lobby. Theres also 24 hr fitness sport, sbux, walgreens, and so many others in the adjacent shopping center that u can walk to. The staff was very nice and responded quickly. Rooms were clean, and very nicely furnished, with modern granite countertops in kitchen and nicely tiled bathrooms that had jacuzzi tub.


Only negative - still the old type tv. I could not hook up hdmi to use my ipad to downstream movies....otherwise, we would stay here again.</p><br>O.K. but deceptive "2 bedrooms"<p>There were 5 of us staying at this place and when I booked it, I requested a 2 bedroom suite. When we got into our suite, there was only 1 bedroom. I went downstairs and was told our room was indeed a 2 bedroom because they consider the living room a bedroom since it has a sofa bed. What?! A living room is not a bedroom! And apparently up to 5 people can stay there. How? Sleeping on the floor? We had to pay an extra $20 for a roll away bed. Deceptive! My family sleeping the living room barely slept because the noise of the air conditioner. If we had real bedrooms, they would not have heard it.
The place was overall clean and o.k. (we loved the jacuzzi with waterfall). It was close to the Orleans casino but be warned about their "2 bedroom" suites.
Room Tip: Read the fine print to see if really a "2 bedroom"
See more room tips</p><br>Outdated decor the only complaint<p>Very nice 1 bedroom with jaccuzi tub and 2 sinks in the bathroom. They thought of everything, all the comforts of home. Very friendly staff. Nice pool area. Good location. Very comfortable bed. The decor is a bit outdated, large footprint TV without any movie channels or options to purchase movies. The living room furniture was old, worn and due for replacement. The kitchen and bedroom were just fine. We would stay there again
Room Tip: There could be lots of stumping on your head if you stay on the first or second level.
See more room tips</p><br>Stay Again<p>Large, spacious and well equipped accomodation close enough to The Strip for easy access but far enough away to retreat when you have had enough. Pool area is very nice. Only negative was that the pool water could have been cleaner - very murky. A minor downside to what is a great place to stay.</p><br>Lovely<p>This is a lovely place! My parents own a vacation here and offered us a few days to stay. We were supposed to get a studio room but ended up with a two bedroom suite! It was so nice having a full kitchen. Rooms were well stocked with towels and wash cloths. The bathtubs had jets that made my bubble bath to die for! The pool was very nice. My only complaint is that they haven't upgraded to flat screen TV's and docking stations for iPhones or iPods.
Room Tip: Ground level for a view of the pool equals lack of privacy if you like your curtains open.
See more room tips</p><br>Worth a second visit<p>Check-in was swift. Room was well appointed but toilet bowl had stain and stain above light switch in tub area. Good amount of space for 2. Kitchen had everything I needed (I cooked all my meals there) except spatter cover. Microwave and Refrigerator were great, even an oven[didn't try]. NO covered handicapped parking so I used regular spaces. I had a car but there were regular shuttles to the strip/airport and occasional shuttles for food, etc. They got mixed up on their mid-week cleaning for me - more cleaning = more $. Pool area and activity areas were excellent. Room help was superb - The two problems I had were both corrected before 7pm of my first day. Internet in lounge was great- otherwise poor and $$$. Two other requests were satisfied immediately.
Room Tip: Try to get on the first floor facing the pool. The third floor on the south side does not really se...
See more room tips</p><br>It was ok.<p>We stayed her for a week for our anniersary. The hotel was nice, a lot better then we were expecting. We are a timeshare owner and were staying here with our bonus time. We thought we had booked at tahiti village.. and were excited because of the pool. We were bummed when we realized we had booked the wrong hotel but we went with an open mind. The pool was not really that great. It was small and not that fun.

We enjoyed the room, there is nothing really bad to say about the hotel besides that it was far from the strip. Taking the shuttle was a pain. You had to plan your day around taking it and making sure it was going to the right end of the strip.

One thing that was VERY annoying was we booked a shuttle to fremont street at the hotel. The lady at the hotel forgot to reserve our seat on the shuttle.We had a show at 6:30 and she said if we took the 6pm shuttle we would be there in plenty of time. At 6:18 we still had not been picked up. The hotel said to pay for a taxi and we would be reimbursed. Well we asked for the manager to call us, I left a VM and still no call back. We are out the $30 for the taxi...

But only $250 for a whole week to stay I guess you cant beat that. But I would never stay here again. Too far from the strip. I will stay at the Mariott on the strip next time with my bonus week.</p><br>Safe key scam, you have no control, look at other on-line complaints<p>My stay of one evening was fine until the next morning at checkout time. The morning desk agent reviewed a number of new charges not communicated at check in. Resort fees, and other silliness I thought were removed resulted in my credit card being charged for the loss of the in room safe key as reported to management by Housekeeping. This I discoverd upon arrival of my bank statement. I did sign an extensive list of agreements upon check in, but never saw the safe let alone abscounded with the key to a safe I could never use again. $75.00 . I called and could only leave a message for the manager. She called me after a couple of weeks. I plead my case to a polite but bored, as in " heard this one before" manager who was not moved by my conclusion that I would have to report what seems to be a scam. Totally bummed.</p><br>Huge, quiet, great place to rest!<p>We shared a double suite. The kitchens, (we had 2) were well stocked with pots and pans and plenty of dishes and silverware. The bathrooms are to die for. Huge and each had a wonderful spa tub.
The staff are extremely helpful and friendly, always talking to us as we passed by. We used the shuttle bus to get us to the strip and also to the other properties so we could walk to the outlet mall.
There is a Denny's next door for breakfast. The breakfasts at the property consisted of juice, coffee and a danish or bagel. Not enough for a busy day ahead. The shuttle makes visits to the grocery store a few times a weeki.
I loved this place and hope my friend invites me back!
The pool has a wonderful hot tub with a waterfall and that is the highlight of the property, don't miss it!</p><br></body></html>
