<html><head><h3>Tahiti Vacation Club Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 6</h3></head><body><br>Average<p>My boyfriend and I stayed at the Tahiti Suites for 2 nights. I would consider this hotel as average. It was on west Tropicana and a few minutes off the strip. The location was OK and more residential vs. touristy. The A/C does not go below 70 degrees, we found the room to be stuffy. I definitely wouldn't stay here during the summer. Also, the bed was uncomfortable.
Though, the price was affordable and the room was average, I probably wouldn't stay here again.
We've stayed at the Tahiti Village located on Las Vegas Blvd and that is far superior than this hotel.</p><br>Las Vegas getaway<p>Stayed for 1 week. Very nice resort, we'll kept. Quiet and comfortable. Well maintained pool/ spa area. Decent continental breakfast. Not too far from the strip. Concierge was always helpful. Easy access to shopping, and attractions.</p><br>Great location for week long stay in Vegas<p>We stayed in a first floor one bedroom condo facing the pool with easy access to both the pool and the parking lot. Unit was very clean and well equipped. Heated pools and a hot tub were warm enough to use although the weather was only in the 60s F. BBQs were spotless. We enjoyed meeting other guests in the breakfast room daily but a daily bagel did wear thin after a few days! However we could have walked to a grocery store to purchase our own breakfast foods! Rented a car so that we could see some of the other sights of Vegas and area. Made use of the shuttle service to the strip which was very handy. All staff were friendly and helpful - particularly Mercedes who served us at check in. We look forward to returning to this property next year.
Room Tip: Noise does travel so rooms on the top floor may be a little quieter especially in the summer when th...

We had a 1 bedroom that was very clean and had 2 large TV's and fully stocked, including all kitchen equipment, washer, dryer and jetted tub. We had a room that over looked the pools, it was nice to sit on the patio. The resort is more appropriate for the 50 + set. Not much here for children. Our room was very clean including carpets and furniture. Maid service is once through the week, and fine for us, plenty of towels and supplies.The hotel offers a shuttle to and from the strip and Freemonte street on Thursday nights, very prompt and runs daily and nightly every hour. The staff are very nice always helpful. I had read that people complained about deodorizer in the halls, it is actually the carpet shampoo and the carpets are spotless! The hotel is located in a good area on Tropicana with shopping and restaurants within walking distance. We enjoyed many of the outdoor activities in the area including red rock canyon and valley of fire. Paris tower a night is a great view of the fountains at Bellagio and the lights of the strip at night. There is plenty to do in the vegas area if you are not a gambler. I would recommend and stay here again. Great property off the strip. Special thanks to the staff who go above and beyond. We are RCI members so did not bother with the time share offers of show tix etc, how ever when you check in they give you a welcome package with some show tix in it, we enjoyed the hypnotist at Hooters for an 8 $ fee each but included a free drink at the bar prior to the show. Great place to stay !</p><br>Very Nice Stay Off the Vegas Strip<p>We booked two rooms-- one with a kitchen, living room, bathroom and bedroom. The second unit was an efficiency with a double bed, a mini kitchen and a bathroom. Both units were just beautiful, had an adjoining door so we could all gather together in the living room and kitchen area.

The decorating was elegant and the rooms were very clean. We had everything we could need.
Nice bedding, large screen televisions in the living room and bedrooms, both. Dishes, kitchen towels and utensils were all provided.

The check in was easy. We used the concierge for information on the Las Vegas area.

The pool area was also very nice.

We were looking for a quiet area off the strip that would be good for a family event. This was just
what we needed.

Thanks for a great stay.</p><br>Nice place off-strip but lacking in activities<p>My first stay here at Tahiti. My wife, me and 2 other relatives went to Vegas in late Dec and we wanted a 2 bdrm condo with kitchen. Great location on W Tropicana. Pool looked nice but it was way too cold outside to use it; fitness center was average; free breakfast was basic - coffee, tea, muffins, bananas, apples, bagels, etc.
Pros: good price for a condo in Vegas, rooms were nice and quiet, good off-strip location
Cons: A resort fee of $10/day was not disclosed on their website when I made my reservation, maybe in was hidden under misc "taxes"; I dont mind paying a resort fee but would like more transparency... The Activity Center boasted: Pool table, video games, scheduled activities, chalk board, puzzles, and a Wii; however, the pool table and video games are coin-operated, there were no scheduled activities, chalk board, puzzles or a Wii while I was there. Dont expect to entertain kids at the Activity Center b/c it is lame.Go across the street to the park, you'll have more fun with kids.
Room Tip: Rooms in the back are quieter.

We found the condo to be fully furnished and nicely appointed about one mile off the Strip on Tropicana West. If you're looking to avoid the Strip traffic until it's time to see a show or hit a casino, this is the place for you. The Tahiti was relaxing in a very busy city with a comfortable bed, quiet surroundings, great hot tub, barbecue grill, exercise room, shuttle service (we rented a car which is the way to go), and no sales pressure to buy. A free continental breakfast is provided daily (nothing overwhelming, but adequate). The price was right, services very good, and a great place to do Vegas the way you want to.
Room Tip: Stay on the top level in the summer when there are more children up and about.
See more room tips</p><br>Resort not Village<p>When I made my reservations I made it clear that I wanted to stay at Tahiti Village. Well it was getting closer to trip time so I called to ask some questions about the shuttle and found out my reservations were for the Tahiti Resort on W Tropicana. I was very upset.


Once I got to Vegas I told the front desk my story and I was told that others had this same complaint. Shame on the reservations department.

The unit was very nice and the front desk clerks Nicole and Heather were great.

Sunday night when we returned to the unit our keys had been deactivated. Again I was upset. The front desk clerk said he didn't know why, but he gave me new keys.</p><br>Not what we expected<p>The resort is called Tahiti vacation club but on Interval International it was just shown as Tahiti. We thought we were staying at Tahiti Village, near the town plaza. A location we had specifically selected. On arrival at the vibrant Tahiti village we were given a map to the sister resort, Tahiti, the receptionist told us it happened a lot.
Tahiti vacation resort was 4 miles away and about 2 miles from the strip. The shuttle service was good. The room was very average with an uncomfortable bed and old bedding and towels and a super small TV. We had room 201 and it is directly overlooking West Tropicana avenue and extremely noisy. The reception area is attractive and was nicely decked out for Christmas. If you want a quiet resort, this could be it but not in the rooms overlooking the highway. So disappointed as we didn't want a quiet resort and were expecting a lazy river, a vibrant resort and an on site bar/ restaurant.
They really need to make this clear on II about 2 different resort with the same name.
Not sure what cleaning products they are using but they need to change. The smell in the corridors was over powering and sickly and made the resort smell more like a care home than a vacation resort.
Room Tip: away from the highway. I think 101 -106, 201-206 and 301- 306 are along the highway.

Conveniently located minutes from everything but far enough from the chaos. We got a two bedroom suite and it was AWESOME. We were able to make a few meals instead of having to eat out all the time. The grounds are beautiful and well cared for. The staff was outstanding on every level. Unless you NEED to be able to walk downstairs and instantly be surrounded by people and assaulted by lights and noise this is a great place to stay.</p><br></body></html>
