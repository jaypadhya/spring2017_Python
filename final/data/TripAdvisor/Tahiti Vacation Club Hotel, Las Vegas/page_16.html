<html><head><h3>Tahiti Vacation Club Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 16</h3></head><body><br>I would not hesitate staying at Tahiti Vacation Club again<p>I was actually pleasantly surprised with Tahiti Vacation Club. It was better than our party expected. Check in was smooth. We had a two bedroom, lockout suite, which was much larger than we thought it would be and had all the amenities we needed. A little bit older resort but definitely not as old as we were expecting. We loved the pool area, it was fairly quiet when we were there so we had our choice of lounge chairs and loved the pools and hottub. Also loved the island music that was playing by the pool! We rented a car so did not need to use the shuttle and found the location easy to find and a short distance to the strip. We also encountered some maids sitting on the floor by our suite, which was a bit offputting, my first reaction was that it was unprofessional, but we spoke with them and they were very friendly. We called the concierge once to ask a question and she wasn't very friendly, but we might have just caught her at a bad time.

All in all we really liked this resort and would not hesitate to recommend it to others and would definitely stay again. We enjoyed being away from the hustle and bustle on the strip and found this resort very relaxing.</p><br>Great Place<p>My in laws bought a timeshare unit at the Tahiti. It's a 1 bedroom unit with a full kitchen. When we visit Vegas we love staying here. The unit is like a small apartment with plenty of room. The kitchen is fully functional and stocked with plates, glasses, cups, cookware and silverware. This unit also has a washer and dryer. I don't normally cook while on vacation but love the idea of having a fully stocked kitchen to prepare coffee in the morning or for a late night snack. I also love having a bedroom instead of one big hotel room. I wake up earlier than my husband and this unit lets me get a pot of coffee going without waking him up. The bathroom has a shower, jacuzzi tub and double sinks. Everything was clean and in great condition when we arrived. We love having the pool on the grounds as well and was never crowded. We never had any issues with noise in the hallways since there is a bedroom with a door. I can't stand staying at a hotel and hearing hallway noise in the morning while trying to sleep. The front desk staff was very helpful and courteous. They also offer a free shuttle to the strip although I wish it would run later than it does now which i believe is 1am but its easy to get a cab in any hotel. I also love that this place is away from the strip and more quiet than hotels on the strip but close enough to get to within a few minutes. As a timeshare owner Tahiti provides a welcome package which includes some laundry detergent, razors and few other goodies too. Right next door is a Denny's and Quiznos amoung a few other establishments. Within walking distance is a Walgreens and we walked to The Orleans casino but again the free shuttle does make a stop there we just felt like walking. A few minutes away is the supermarket. I would suggest they do a few upgrades like flat screen tv's but really how much time do you spend in your room while in Vegas. As a timeshare owner when we stayed here there was no maid service. That was fine with us because if we needed towels or anything like that we called down to the front desk. They dont come in a make your bed or clean your bathroom on a daily basis but we kept our unit clean and didnt mind not having housekeeping come in. Sometimes while staying in a hotel housekeeping would come in the middle of us trying to get ready for an evening or afternoon out and we've been disturbed several times by them so not having them for us is a good thing.</p><br>Family Reunion in Las Vegas<p>The Tahiti Resort was a wonderful place to stay. Plenty of room in the units and a beautiful pool area with 2 pools and a hot tub that seats 12. Very clean and well maintained property. They also provide shuttle service to and from the Las Vegas strip! Great time!
Room Tip: We had a two bedroom with a pool view.

There is a shuttle service that you can get every hour varying times of day. The staff are friendly, easy-going and kind. There is someone on front desk 24-7. You need something you only need to call and it is provided. You are 5 minutes from grocery stores and a mall next door has various eating places and a 24 hour pharmacy. The grounds are very well-maintained, the atmosphere in pool and spa area is shady and quiet. The bbq area is clean. You can also relax in your room in your jet tub and for myself had all the comforts of home. I would stay here again without a doubt.
Room Tip: The one bedroom suite has a full kitchen and the studio suite has a kitchenette. Everything is provi...

The king sized bed was comfortable.I loved reading a book while I was in the jetted tub.The outdoor hot tub was nice also. They have two heated pools with one end having sand. We didn't use the pools because it was a little too cold when we were there. It is easy to find parking. The breakfast is skimpy. They have individually wrapped danishes and some nice bagels but no juice or fruit. The climate control had a loud fan but it was more like white noise to us. It helped so you didn't hear noise from other people in the building. We only stayed in a one bedroom and really wished it had a couch or more comfortable seating. There were two small chairs to sit in at the table but the TV faced the bed and so it was difficult to watch TV from any other part of the room. Over all it was a nice place to stay especially if you have a car to get around, although they do have shuttles.</p><br>Good value and relaxed<p>I stayed here for 6 nights and I found the hotel relaxing and quiet. It has less than 200 rooms and is a short car ride away from the Strip. The studio room was well furnished with a kitchenette which included a microwave and a toaster in addition to glassware, crockery and all necessary utensils. There is wifi in the public areas and also the hotel computers for guest use. Also two very pleasant pools. This is a far cry from the general chaos and hullabaloo of the mega Strip hotels and is ideal for families, couples etc who prefer to be in a quiet location. There are restaurants next door, including a Dennys and a Starbucks. A car is essentioal although the hotel does offer shuttle services.

I did find the breakfast selection a nonsense, as other guests have reported. It would be better if the hotel management either scrapped this altogether or provided a full breakfast service (with real milk for example) at a charge.

Apart from this, the hotel was excellent value out of season.</p><br>Next best thing to the strip<p>We stayed in a two bedroom (one bedroom with a lockoff efficiency) at Tahiti Village for the week of 24-31 January 2012. The room was very clean and the staff was very responsive. We needed a light bulb and they were there as soon as I got off the phone. They have free wifi in the lobby area and free continental breakfast everyday. The pool is open year round and appeared to be cleaned everyday. You could sit around the pool and relax while listening to the polynesian music. The security was the best I have seen. We had rented a car and is was a five minute drive to the strip. There was a drug store and grocery store a five minute walk away. They also had covered parking. I would recommend this place for couples or families.</p><br>Great accomdations/Internet rip-off<p>This review applies to the original Tahiti and NOT the their newer "Tahiti Village." Spacious & clean. Be advised there are two kinds of "Deluxe 1 Bedroom". One has a full kitchen, washer/dryer, large master suite/bathroom, living room (w/ sleeper sofa), dining area. The other has a bedroom, living room (w/sleeper sofa), but only a limited kitchen (small "bar" refridgerator and microwave), but no other cooking facilities, and no washer/dryer. The two bedroom is these two combined - so LOTS of space to spread out. The resort is basically a quad of 3-story buildings surrounding the pool area (several pools in a nice setting). There is an exercise room and a spa (extra $ for spa services). There were no resort activities the week we were there, but that may have been because it was the end of January (pretty quite time of the year). They do provide pastries and coffee for breakfast if you don't have your own. If you don't have a car on your trip, you COULD survive without one. The nearest casino (The Orleans) is less than a half mile away (not sure I would walk it at midnight) that has several different restaurants in addition to the ubiquitous buffet. There is a shuttle to The Orleans, as well as shuttles to either end of the Strip (New York New York or the Mirage). There is a grocery store shuttle 3 x /week. The property is located adjacent to a strip mall with some eating establishments (Denny's, Starbucks, Q'doba, Quiznos, etc). Walgreens (with some food items) is in that strip mall, and a large gas station convenience store across the street from Walgreens. HOWEVER, the advertised "wi-fi available" is a total rip-off. Yes, I expect to pay for internet at vacation resorts (after all, the time share owners would have their dues increased if there was free internet), but I DON'T expect to pay $50.95 for 7 days, and for EACH wireless device!! Other vacation resort internet services provide a code to use for other wireless devices once you pay once. I'm even OK using only 1 device at a time, but there is NO way to use your $51 worth of internet on any other device. The company phone number doesn't answer, the tech support never connected to a live person, and the front desk claimed they had no way to get you a code (even though there is a spot to enter a code instead of buying service, and you can get internet for only $10 a week if you take the 90 minute resort sales tour pitch - so there IS a way to get a code if the resort wanted to!!). Oh, and once you whine to the front desk, THEN they mention that there is free wireless in the lobby (but they have to enter the password onto your device themselves). Or, you could walk just over to the Starbucks and use their free wi-fi.</p><br>Had to ask for change of room....<p>Be careful staying here...I just returned from 2 weeks in Vegas and one of the weeks I spent staying at tahiti vacation club (the other week was at tahiti village on las vegas drive). Lobby and staff seemed nice upon check-in, but the room I was initially given can only be described as gross. I should have never unpacked, but I was in a hurry to make an business appointment (trade show booth set-up) that afternoon. The room had a terrible strong musty smell, stained sheets and stained bedspread, cigarette burns in carpet and unknown things (im praying they were some type of seed and not insect eggs) that were spread all around the room. I returned home much later that night with lysol air freshner to help with the smell in hand, and i reluctantly spent the night in that room. In the morning, I found the seeds/eggs on the floor and the stains on the cover and sheets and I immediately requested a change of room. Initially I was denied and was simply told the resort was full. The staff at that time offered no response, no questions and no concern at all for my reasons for wanting to switch rooms. I was simply told to try back later. I came back to the hotel mid-day, spoke to a different front desk staff and was then indeed given a different room. This room, though the same size, was in a different building and was much better. I was relieved and immediately moved into that room for the remainder of my stay. After the switch, I returned to the front desk to return the cards to my initial room and was then dismayed when I was told I was "lucky" and that I should not have been given the other room. Had I been told to stay in the first room, on this review I would have posted the pics I took of the first room and warned all on here to avoid this place. However apparently I was "lucky", and since I was given then second room and seeing as how I had no problems or complaints of that second room that I was given, i feel an average rating seems correct.

Overall this seems like an older resort and is removed quite a distance from the strip, the closest casino is the Orleans.

I doubt I will return here, but if I did, I certainly will check my room much closer before unpacking.</p><br>Great Value for families!<p>I have stayed at Tahiti Suites several time and must say I love it! I travel to Vegas often and will usually book here if my family is traveling with me. It is a home away from home and they are very reasonably priced! I have never been harassed for a timeshare presentation . You will want to have a vehicle if your considering this place!</p><br></body></html>
