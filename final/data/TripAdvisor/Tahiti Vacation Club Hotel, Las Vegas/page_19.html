<html><head><h3>Tahiti Vacation Club Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 19</h3></head><body><br>Good value and convenient<p>First time that I stayed off the strip. It was kind of nice for a change to be away from the hectic pace of the strip but just minutes away. I did go to the strip casinos each night as well as downtown and found it very convenient from the resort. The resort is a good value for the money. It is nothing fancy but very adequate. The rooms are of good size and clean. Available is all the essentials in the kitchen as well as stereo, dvd player and washer and dryer. No added perks. The overall property is well utilize with very little open area except the pool area and parking lot. No issue throughout my week with noise that would bother sleeping at night. The cons of the units is that the lighting is poor and the placement of the light switches is odd. The workout room is inadequate with a couple of old treadmills, a stair master and couple of universal gym pieces. If you need elevator access be sure to get a room near front of building. The property is convenient to several fast food places within a 100 feet as well as a Walgreens.
Room Tip: If use of elevator is needed get room in front of

Our big complaint was Thursday morning at 7 AM, groundskeeping staff commenced using loud leaf blowers immediately outside our bedroom window. This noise persisted for more than 30 minutes. When I later complained (politely) to the front desk, ahem, this is Vegas, most people don't want a leaf blower outside their window at 7am, the response was, "they only show up on Thursdays." No apology, just a tone of thats the way it is, too bad for you. Because it only happens once per week, guests should just put up with it. Maybe I could show up at your home while your trying to sleep, bub, and run a leaf blower for 1/2 an hour. I immediately left a comment in the box for the manager about this, I heard nothing back (we stayed two more nights after this). 8am would have been fine with us. But 7am just crossed the line.

Other than the leaf blower experience, the place was good. The pool is a great place to catch sun between 10am and about 6pm (this in May). People enjoy drinks by the pool, but it does not get over the top.

The shuttle to the strip was punctual and comfortable. We used it twice.

The complimentary breakfast 'wake up' is incredibly skimpy. World's worst danish, fake orange juice, coffee/tea. I brought my own yogurt, but they had no spoons. Too expensive to provide spoons, I guess.

The room itself was very comfortable and well appointed. Great King Bed, nice tile work, central air conditioning, closet, much roomier than an average hotel room. Note, 1) Daily maid service is not included, 2) If you want wireless internet in your room, you must pay extra, 3) 10am checkout. We were aware of these three factors before our trip, so we were fine.

Warning, the place is a time share, don't accept the invitation to tour the property, or you'll lose 2 hours of your life (we didn't, but talked to others who did).

Overall, we wanted to be off strip, avoid staying at a gigantic place, and have a great pool area. This place served our needs on all three counts. But just a little more effort on the part of management could have made our stay even better. Would I stay here again? Uh, probably not. Vegas is full of options.
Room Tip: Don't face major construction across the road.
See more room tips</p><br>Tahiti was an awesome place to stay<p>We loved staying at Tahiti - front desk staff were wonderful - especially Megan. We stayed in a two bedroom unit and it was wonderful - especially liked the in unit washer/dryer, as well as the shuttle to/from the 'strip'. The $5 per person trip to Red Rock Canyon was great and we highly recommend the trip. Also the free trip to Freemont Street downtown - wish the trip lasted a little longer, but had alot of fun nonetheless. The pools, although heated, were rather cool - definitely not our idea of heated, but the spa was nice! All in all, would definitely stay at Tahiti again.</p><br>The accommodations were fine, but beware fast talking check-in staff...<p>Accommodations were fine, although room was very smelly with cleaner - husband had bad allergies from it; carpet had just been cleaned and was still damp, although still stained. Otherwise, it was fine to stay there just for overnight (oh, but small, flat pillows), although I certainly paid way too much. Also, no free wi-fi and an early checkout of 10:00 am, which was unexpected where it's over $100/night.

I was just staying overnight to attend a Sat. night event at another hotel that was sold out. So, found a room at Tahiti that seemed reasonable. Had a 6 hr drive to get there, was tired, but in good spirits, checked in, went to my rooom, went to my event, returned for sleep, and checked out the next day.

Two days later, i checked my bank account and an additional $22.40 was charged to my account. I called and they said it was because my room had been upgraded. I didn't request an upgrade, I wasn't offered an upgrade and at no time was I aware that the room I stayed in was an upgrade. They refused to refund the amount stating that since I had stayed in the room it was too late.

Well, I'm calling that a scam and am here to warn future Tahiti Vacation Club travelers or those who stay at this Tahiti hotel on 5101 West Tropicana in Las Vegas, caveat emptor - learn from my mistakes. Do not let the fast-talking check-in people take advantage of you. I never would have upgraded for just one night of sleep - which wasn't even all that great.
Room Tip: Make sure you're not 'upgraded'

Has two nice pools with different temps. Nice spa with waterfall. Rooms are large and clean. Comfortable mattresses. Terrible continental breakfast, don't count on being able to stomach it. Shuttle buses run pretty full and odd routes and timings, easier to take the car.</p><br>Very nice place!<p>We loved everything about the place. Nice beds, it was very clean. And loved being away from the strip! We had a two bedroom lock off. We all lived it! Not sure why there is a bad review at all!</p><br>WONDERFUL PLACE<p>We were worried about staying here due to the previous reviews but we loved it! I'm not sure what people have to complain about.
My husband and I were on a business trip and we took a friend along. We stayed in a 2 bedroom and it was very private. The living common area is in the middle with the kitchen and the bedrooms were on opposite ends. My husband and I also had a kitchenette in our room which I assume would be considered the studio if one was to rent a studio. Each room had its own bathroom and we also had a washer/dryer. Quite small but sufficient for our laundry for 6 days.
The pool was very clean and warm. Hot tub gorgeous! There are 3 gas grills in the pool area which we used to cook lunch one day and it was great. We did not eat their complimentary breakfast since we cooked our own in our room so I can't comment on that. Our 3rd floor balcony overlooked the pool which was great since other rooms were over the road or parking lot. So we were very happy with our view.
We had a rental car so we didn't need to use the shuttle. It looks like a pretty long walk to the strip so I would definitely recommend the shuttle use if you don't have a car.
We paid an excellent rate we found on a website so we were very pleased with the value for what we received.
The staff was FANTASTIC! Very helpful with information and was very quick to respond to any of our requests. We have absolutely nothing but good things to say about this place and the staff.
We will definitely stay here again!</p><br>NEVER AGAIN!<p>Oh I can't even start to say what a horrible experience my few hours at "Tahiti" were. They put us in a room that was NOT clean. There was toothpaste in the sink and used toiletries and towels in the bathroom. Then they transfered us to another room, which quite literally had an ash-tray dumped out in the middle of the room and it reaked like cigarette smoke. Finally on the THIRD try we found a place to sleep. Horrible experience. You can count on me NOT coming back.</p><br>Very nice suites<p>We stayed here 2 nights with our kids and my mother in a two room suite. It was a bueatiful suite, very roomy, with everything you need. The hotel was very quiet and nicely located. I could not find a better deal for a two room suite in town. Both bedrooms had queen beds and both bathtubs had jacuzzi jets. The pools were very well set up but I would not call them heated very well. They are in the shade most of the day and the kids were not in there long before they were shivering. I would say the time of the year had to do with that. I would say they would be excellent in the summer. I will definately stay here again next time I am in town.</p><br>Great Experience Off the Strip!<p>We stayed at Tahiti over Easter weekend for an annual event we attend at the Orleans Hotel (Viva Las Vegas Rockabilly Reunion). We dont really like staying in casinos and needed a place close to the Orleans - Tahiti was it! It is a couple minute drive, or about a 10-15 minute casual walk a couple lights East on Tropicana.

We arrived at Tahiti earlier than the stated check-in time (4pm) and they had us checked into our room immediately (3rd floor, pool view at the end of the hallway). Due to our budget constraints due to the event this year, we booked the Jr Studio room - which was perfect for us! The bathroom was a good size with a single vanity and a heavenly jacuzzi bathtub! The room was very open for being a studio room so that my boyfriend and I had no trouble getting ready or preparing meals. The kitchenette is decent - sink, dishes (plates, bowls, cups, coffee cups, utensils, etc), small microwave, toaster,coffee-maker and small fridge (practically no freezer space, but held our food and drinks perfectly fine). We used the BBQ grills by the pool to cook dinner one night (there are three grills). As others have mentioned, since Tahiti is part time share your room doesn't get regular housecleaning like you experience in a standard hotel. We were only there a few nights so we didn't need to request any new towels or sheets. Unlike the One and Two-Bedroom suites, the studio suite does not have a fireplace, washer/dryer, full kitchen (full-size fridge, oven/stove, etc), and patio/balcony. The pool area looked pretty relaxing, however we weren't really able to utilize it due to my need to be at the Orleans for modeling jobs during the day. I was able to check them out briefly though. There are two pools (the beach entry pool with real sand was heated, the other was not), a rock feature water fountain, and a jacuzzi with a rock waterfall into it. The grounds were kept clean and the parking was decent. Tahiti does not offer free internet - I think it was something like $10 a day so we did without it.

We utilized the hotel's free shuttle a few times to get to the Orleans. The shuttle was timely, the driver was friendly, and the ride was only a couple minutes to get to the first stop). There is a shopping center just next door to the hotel with a Starbucks, restaurants, grocery store, etc. so it is very convenient. Being a time share location we were worried about having to sit through the sales pitch but it was never once brought up to us...thank goodness! If you don't mind being off the strip and you don't want to stay in a smokey casino - this is a great choice! We'll definitely be back next year!</p><br></body></html>
