<html><head><h3>Tahiti Vacation Club Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 3</h3></head><body><br>Good Place to stay<p>Stayed here 5 days/4 nights during the 4th of July holiday. I originally thought I was staying at Tahiti Village, where I had stayed in 2008. Although Tahati is not as new as Tahati Village and do not have as many amenities on the property,I was very happy with my stay here. The staff were very friendly and helpful, the rooms were updated and clean. Although, the strip was 5 miles away, there are shuttle buses that goes to and from the strip once an hour. Also, there are stores and eating places within and Orleans Casino with in walking distance. Overall, this was good clean, friendly and quiet resort to get away to. When I was away from the strip, was able to go back to a quiet resort; and if you are in to swimming the pool is open 24 hours. This is an excellent resort to get away to.</p><br>Nice<p>Stay here for five days. Had couple of problems with room. It was addressed to management. Manager addressed the situation and it was taken care of. Pool and parking lot was not over crowded. Besides the hallway smelling like scented Raid Roach Spray. I would recommend this location to family, friends and co-worker...</p><br>Good base for all of Vegas attractions<p>Not a single complaint or problem with this property. We had a ground floor studio. Reception were efficient, guest relations helped with show tickets. Free wifi and breakfast of bagels, muffins, fresh fruit, tea coffee juice. Nice pools and a barbeque area. Complementary shuttle bus to the strip, extended hours at the weekend. Plenty of car parking spaces, many covered which helped in 40 degrees. Right next door is a Papa Johns pizza takeway, Starbucks, and a Walgreens.</p><br>Great service, nice facilties<p>I'd rate this place a 3.5 just for the service. The pools are nice. Really quiet and super low key. Pool's open 24, along with the grills which is awesome. Seems like a regular resort, except if you're there for Vegas things, they are far away. We had the kids with us so didn't mind not having slot machines all over. When it got later in the afternoon though just seemed like a chore to go gamble, one of us stay at the room with the kids, then switch.

We had our own car, but they do have a shuttle service that runs to two casinos, I think Mirage and ...something else.

This was an overnight stay for us and if I had to do it again, since I was staying mid-week I would have stayed at a hotel on the strip. The price would have been the same, the pools for the kids would have been nicer and we could have just walked to a slot machine to contribute money to whatever hotel we would have been at.

The service here was really great. Maintenance guy for fixing the remote was nice, showed up quick, even joked with me that I was doing too much with trying to get the remote cover open because it was my vacation. Same with the linen lady, showed up right away with a stack of towels. A bit of overkill but who is going to complain that they have extra towels?
Room Tip: Since the pool is 24/7 if you're worried about noise I'd ask for a room away from the pool...

We enjoyed the free breakfast and it was nice to have such a friendly employee (Marta) who always greeted the guests. There was only one type of bagel, two types of muffins, oranges, bananas and coffee/water/orange juice every day which is fine if you are staying the weekend but for a week long trip it would have been nice if there was more variety. Although we rented a car the free shuttle service was nice so we could enjoy the strip and Fremont Street without having to drive on it. Be sure to ask the front desk for pool towels. They do not clean the rooms every morning so be sure to ask what day/time they do and what to do with used towels/where to get new ones. There was always someplace to sit by the pool and room to swim. Nowhere did it smell like smoke. The rooms and pool area were quiet and very family friendly. We would stay here again.</p><br>Ok hotel, bad location.<p>i ended up staying here for a week after booking a mystery hotel.

The hotel was about an hours walk from the strip.There were a lot of older guests there that were alot of older guests there and I think it is part of a timeshare group.

I arrived very late on a night when a convention was on. Hotel was overbooked and there was a chance that i would be relocated to a partner hotel. I was given the last available room which was good as i had internal laundry facilities.

There were hourly buses to the strip, but its a long wait when you miss a bus. The buses also stop at midnight on weekends so if you want to stay longer you need to find your own way back.

On the one night I walked back, I was approaced by 3 "ladys of the night offering their nightly services: - while flattering I would not take the risk.

Buffet breakfast is very simple. Bagels and coffee.

By no means the worst hotel I have stayed at but next time, Ill stay closer to teh strip.</p><br>Nice Surprise<p>Was pleasantly surprised by the nice pool area, very nice grills. The 1 bedroom was large with a full kitchen and fireplace. We aren't gamblers so we were happy to be off the strip. convenient Walgreens and Starbucks next door. Shuttle bus driver was very nice and professional on a grocery store trip. Phillip at check in was helpful with changing our initial room. It was a nonsmoking room that definitely had smoking guests prior. We were situated with a new room right away and all was well the rest of the weekend. Enjoyed the stay!</p><br>Perfect Blend of Convenience and Tranquility<p>While only 5 minutes from the Strip, it feels like a world away when you walk through the doors. There's a beautiful lobby area and friendly helpful staff at both the front and concierge desks. Continental breakfast and some other special snack events available in the breakfast room. This is an all suite property and we have stayed in both the studio and one bedroom and they are great.

The one bedroom suites are really small apartments and great for families or for friends traveling together who want to save money by sharing but have some privacy and room too spread out. There's even a beautiful fireplace and jetted tub. You can do your laundry right in your room in the one bedroom or in the laundry room if in the studio.

This is a great property for people planning a longer stay, say 5+ days but also just a nice spot for one or a couple of nights. They have a convenient hourly shuttle that stops two places on the Strip. They also have a grocery run shuttle that runs several days a week, a Town Square mall shuttle that runs a few days a week a shuttle to the downtown Fremont Street area on Thursdays as well as a Red Rock Canyon excursion.

Need a break from the tourist stuff? There are crafts, games and other activities on-site, many for free almost every day of the week! Or, take a glorious break in the courtyard with two sand bottomed pools, a lovely fountain and barbecue area. You'll feel a world away from the hectic Las Vegas tourist scene.

Free parking. Small shopping center with a couple of fast food place next door and a convenience store/gas station on the block.
Room Tip: Request a courtyard view room where possible and ask not to be put near Tropicana Ave side
See more room tips</p><br>Very nice place: close to the strip, but not TOO close<p>We were a little nervous about staying here because we read some not so great reviews. So we were very pleasantly surprised when we checked in. The lobby was nice, the people were mostly friendly, and our rooms were large, clean, and pretty modern.
You can check out movies and board games for free. The pools were the perfect temperature, and the sand entries were a nice touch. People were able to sunbathe in lounge chairs in the sand that was in the water so they could keep cooler.
The free breakfast is ok. It's better than nothing. We were there for a week and here were the choices: bananas, oranges, banana nut muffins, blueberry muffins, bagels, orange juice, water, and coffee. That's it. Every day. Again, fine for free, but wish they would have changed it up just a little.
There were free shuttles that were offered to take guests to various places; the strip, Freemont Street, grocery store, and a few other places. They also offered daily activities such as ice cream sundaes, cookie decorating, and a scavenger hunt.
Overall, I was quite pleased with Tahiti Vacation Club and would totally recommend it to everybody.</p><br>Great convenience <p>Nicely done; clean and updated; very convenient to the Vegas strip. Shuttle was convenient. Pool and grounds were very well maintained. Staff was friendly and quite accommodating. We enjoyed our stay very much.</p><br></body></html>
