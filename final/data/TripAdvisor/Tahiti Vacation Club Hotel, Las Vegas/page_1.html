<html><head><h3>Tahiti Vacation Club Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 1</h3></head><body><br>Better than expected<p>Came here without really knowing anything about the hotel and was very pleasantly surprised. We had the one bedroom room, which is just a one bedroom apartment. Very spacious. Tub is very comfortable, fireplace is cozy. TV in both living room and bedroom. Comfortable bed and pillows. Hotel overall was quiet for the most part. We did have a mix up when we arrived about our room, so we had to spend one night in the studio, but that also was cozy yet spacious and we also got a free extra night out of it. Lots of food options around! It is a bit far from the strip but this didn't bother us.

My only cons are: the strong smell in the hallways, an earwig greeted us in our bathroom in the studio room, the suuuuuper loud drain in the tub and super loud washing machine, and I'm pretty sure their face soap that they have gave me a rash.

Overall I enjoyed my stay and would come back here my next time in Las Vegas.</p><br>Relaxing and Quiet<p>Checked in Nov 15, and the room was ready and clean. The place was quiet and spacious. l bedroom unit. We did see however, several what appeared to be non service dogs being walked on the site. Also, there should be on the back side of building A, a ramp for people to take their belongings up and down. Also, locked out, early one evening and the guard wouldn't even come near that door and it was still lite, so I could tell him, I left my key in the room.
The goodies served in the Mornings were great, and the coffee was wonderful. Pools were clean, and quiet. Place seems pretty secure. Would definitely stay there again.
Room Tip: Rooms on top floor of building A

I reported it at the desk and before i got back to the unit, someone was there to take care of it. The unit was clean and well equipped. We didn't use the pool as the weather was too cool.. My only negative comment would be the smell of air freshener or something. It was very strong in the halls, somewhat in the living room, but not noticeable in the bedroom. We were on the 1st floor and it was very quiet. The facility is not located on the Strip, but very close and they offer a shuttle service.
Room Tip: We were on the ground floor, with the parking lot outside, but it was quiet.

There weren't a lot of on site activities but we didn't come for that. A dedicated shuttle to the Tropicana and Mirage for the vacationers was nice.</p><br>No complaints whatever<p>We have stayed at a number of time share properties in Las Vegas over the years with mixed results. The Tahiti met or exceeded our needs in every area.
First, we were assigned a 1BR nonsmoking unit on the first floor very near the west side rear entrance. Were able to park throughout the week very close to our unit. Very convenient.
The unit itself was clean well equipped - full kitchen, lots of cookware and utensils, washer/dryer, spa tub, 2 TVs, DVD player, gas fireplace, etc... and everything worked.
Extra coffee for the coffee maker, fresh towels, extra shampoo, etc, were all readily available from housekeeping who were in the hallway every morning.
Internet is not lightning fast but fully adequate for most things and free! A big plus.
The free continental breakfast each morning was a great time to share experiences and plans for the day with other guests. Helped a lot, and we made some new friends. Kudos to the breakfast staff for great, friendly service.
We wouldn't think of visiting Vegas and not renting a car. There are so many things to see and do away from the Strip. For us the location of the Tahiti is perfect.
And something we really appreciated - no mention whatever about any painful timeshare presentations.
A great week, and we will look to returning to the Tahiti.</p><br>great stay<p>Although the property looked a little worn, it was spotlessly clean and very well appointed. Staff were great, helpful and courteous at all times. Shops and restaurants close by, great pool, and large rooms.
I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Las Vegas, and wishing to be away from the hustle and bustle of the 'Strip'.</p><br>Off The Strip<p>This vacation club hotel is about 15 minutes off the strip which helps to make it an oasis in the midst of all the bright lights and noise of Las Vegas. The one or two bedroom suites are very clean and well maintained. The two bedroom suite we had had the usual amenities but also had a stacked washer and dryer. The pool area was well kept with two partial sand bottom pools, a fountain and a hot tub, with plenty of chairs, lounges and palapas. An outdoor kitchen area had three gas grills and two refrigerators plus tables and seating. The staff was uniformly friendly and competent. Between the front desk employees and the concierge we received good suggestions for restaurants. Although there is limited shuttle service to and from the strip and to a local grocery store, it would be good to have a rental car for unlimited mobility. If you're looking for a clean and quiet retreat from the craziness of Vegas, look no further.</p><br>Just ok<p>Rooms was studio,on the third floor towards the end of the building. There is only one elevator which is one the first floor and at the front of the building. Was hard to get to our room from the parking lot. came back to the hotel a little after 10pm only to our side parking lot closed ... Supposedly for security, however we left early in the morning only to see people with backpacks walking in the parking lot. When they saw us they jumped the wall. Limited tv channels,and No daily room service unless you stay 7 or more days. You can get towels and other items if call to get them. We waited for 30 minutes. To get towels. Not sure why we were charged resort fees ... Really don't do anything for them. Tub is spa type and tall hard to get in and out of. They do have a form of free breakfast... Muffins and bagels. Concierge and Advertise free tickets to shows ... Have a copied paper of free admission to car show at Linc.
Room Tip: Bottom floor and not 300's
See more room tips</p><br>Home away from home<p>I own a few time shares in Vegas but this is my favorite. It's on TROPICANA Ave . It's approximately 1/4 mile from the Orleans hotel/casino & 3 miles from the "strip". There are free shuttle buses running every hour to NYNY & the Mirage to get you to the strip. The resort consists of three,three story buildings. In the middle are 2 pools, a fountain, and hot tub. The is also a BBQ area, a small fitness center & other amenities . I have been coming here for 10 years & always find it clean & the staff is helpful & courteous . If you desire a smaller reset with a more intimate feel & slightly off the energy of the strip I highly recommend this place</p><br>Stayed 1 night and left. <p>After a long day of traveling my husband and I got to the resort about 12:30am. It wasn't very clean although the person at the desk was friendly. Made it to our room about 1am and as we approached the door it was open about 4 inches. My husband did a walk through to be sure no one was inside. The door did not lock so I could not sleep that evening so we left the next day. Very disappointed!</p><br></body></html>
