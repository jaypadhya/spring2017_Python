yes the furniture is a bit outdated buy really who cares, your on the go most of the time anyways, would highly recommend this resort to friends and family and we ourselves if we ever do go back to Vegas will definitely stay here again!!
Also the grill area was wonderful for us, as my husband likes to cook so much cheaper than going out to eat and good grocery shops in the area helped!!! we would recommend Smith's!!!
Room Tip: we were on the 1st floor in a 1 bedroom unit very roomy, we had a view of the pool which was very ni...

We started out in a nice studio which was super clean and had a nice king sized bed. There is a lounge near the front desk to use with no chare for the wi-fi but a charge of $6 per hour for room use.
We were upgraded 3 days later to a one bedroom which was really a way better place for us. We loved having a kitchen, two TVs and even a washer and dryer. Recent renos with granite counter tops, new paint and nice furnishings makes this a great choice.
This place is off the Las Vegas Blvd "strip" but very convenient. Shuttle every hour to either New York/NY hotel or Mirage. We got less nervous about using the car and found out every CASINO HOTEL allows for free self-parking. This made the strip so accessible and easier to manage.
The outdoor pool looked lovely and they played relaxing music until around 8 pm. The free breakfast was bagels, cream cheese or jam and strawberry or orange drinks, tea and coffee. Coffee and tea were available all day in the lounge also. This resort is 10 minutes to the South Outlet mall by car and the resort provides a shuttle here once a week. Free shuttle to Freemont Street on Thursday evenings. Try the Orleans (2 block walk) for a great buffet for only $15 except on weekends when the price jumps up to $25. Denny's next door is a nice option and the Front Desk staff are really good about telling you places to go for shopping, etc. Try it--you'll like this one.
Room Tip: One bedrooms overlooking the pool are wonderful.

Front desk was very helpful
WI-FI is not free but now in days cell phones have Internet access and makes it easy to find things

The shuttle is very convenient as it drops you at the New York New York</p><br>Adequate place to stay<p>Stayed here with some friends for a 3 night stay. The hotel is a bit dated and the rooms need some upgrading (like old old TVs and not so comfortable furniture). But overall it was an adequate place to stay in Vegas.

Pros

It's quiet
Rooms are nicely stocked
Parking is easy
Shuttle is on time

Cons
You are a distance from the strip and it's about a $15 cab ride if you miss the shuttles
The amenities are lacking big time - hot tub is ridiculously small and the continental buffet is a joke. Seriously, it's a cold bagel, small danish and coffee with no frills
Our room needed service on the A/C and water heater clanked more than a bad band. The tub didn't drain and became dangerously slippery.

Overall, if you are going to be on the strip a lot, you might want to be closer. If you want a quiet place to hang out, this is a good choice.
Room Tip: Interior pool view is nice, but could be louder in peak pool season since the pool is open 24 hours.

Booking the resort was simple and we received confirmation paperwork in a very timely manner. Our paperwork said that if we were not going to be arriving between a specific time, to contact the resort and let them know. We attempted several times (several days prior to our arrival) to contact the resort and continually got a message and not a person. We even faxed a message to the resort just asking for an acknowledgement so that we were sure that we would be able to get a room. We were traveling with another couple, so we were somewhat stressed as to whether or not there would be someone there or a key would be waiting.

When we arrived, which was around midnight, there was someone working at the front desk and we quickly got our 2 bedroom suite. The employee was very friendly and helpful and really didn't get an answer as to why they did not communicate as they requested on the confirmation form. I would like to say that other than this one issue, the rest was excellent.

The room was very clean and well maintained. We had 2 rooms, a living area, furnished kitchen and even a fireplace. We were on the first floor and can not say whether or not there was someone above us or not, we did not hear anything. We did hear the next door neighbors as they were.........well you know.

We had rented a car, so we didn't utilize the shuttle service. Parking was free and we were given a parking pass. The drive to the strip was only a few minutes away. There were restaurants (Mcdonalds and In-n-Out burgers for example). Starbucks just a block or so down. The breakfast at the Tahiti was bagels, cream cheese, danishes and apple slices I believe. We like Starbucks and Mcdonalds coffee so that is where we went.

Great amenities, it was rainy and cold, but we sure wanted to check out the pools and hot tub area. They have an impressive set up in the pool, bbq area. There was even a putting green.

Other than the small issue of not being able to contact someone as requested, I would highly recommend this resort to anyone wanting a comfortable place to stay. We are planning another trip hopefully during the summer time, and now that i have seem the place and see how they operate, we will definitely look into staying there again.</p><br>Nice stay at Tahiti<p>Overall, this was a very nice stay. we went with another couple. We slept on the sofa bed the first night, which was not very comfortable. The management let us upgrade to a 2 bedroom suite for the rest of our stay, at a very reasonable price. The concierge service was excellent and we used the free shuttle service to the strip almost every day to avoid traffic and parking issues. We only wished there was a better breakfast option than just coffee and pastries. We did walk around the corner to Denny's one morning for a full breakfast. *we were very disappointed that there was NO free internet anywhere except the lobby. Internet service in the room was charged by the hour and we couldn't even use our smartphones in the room. This was very inconvenient since we were constantly needing to look up information about attractions online.</p><br>perfect hotel for stay, feels like home<p>when the first time i came here i feel like wow such a very nice place, cozy, feels like home, quiet, clean and spacious room for hotel, definetely i would like to stay in here again!! very recommended for stay!! :)</p><br>Great Service<p>Concierge services were excellent. Information given was clear and accurate. Shuttle service was great. We were picked up, taken to New York/NewYork on the Strip and returned to the hotel free of charge. Shuttles ran every hour. Our Room 112A (first floor, Bldg. A) was conveniently located near the registration building and hospitality room where a simple continental breakfast was offered daily. A small store in the registration building had frozen pizzas, chicken wings and other food items. Our studio, though small, was comfortable and the whirlpool tub provided welcome relaxation after each day's activities. One drawback was the laundry room. There was only one washer and one dryer and there was a fee for each.
Room Tip: First floor rooms are close to the hospitality room where light breakfasts are offered daily.

Room Tip: Bring basket coffee filters for coffee maker and small salt/pepper shakers.

Not a full resort, could not even extend with the front desk, they suggested to go online and book with expedia/hotwire/etc. But service was good. Good to have a kitchen and living room. Clean and comfortable.</p><br></body></html>
