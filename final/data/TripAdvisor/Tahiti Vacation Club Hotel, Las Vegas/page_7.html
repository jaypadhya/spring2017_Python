<html><head><h3>Tahiti Vacation Club Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 7</h3></head><body><br>Very Good Timeshare Stay<p>Even though the resort is off strip it was a very nice convenient place to stay. when checking in the front desk was quick and very informative. There was a concierge who gave me a few coupons. The room was a studio but nice and large. It was clean and filled with a good amount of amenities. The resort had a very nice set up with a nice pool; grilling area, and putting green. There was a small gym with mostly aerobic equipment and a small laundry. House keeping comes only once and there is a charge for extra service. One problem parking is a trouble especially on the weekend. Twice I had to park in the 15 minute spots for nights because of main lot was full. All cars needed tags from front desk but full. Overall I would stay at resort again. I did enjoy it.
Room Tip: Ask one with balcony
See more room tips</p><br>Great place to stay<p>We were 4 adults and 1 toddler. We had a two bedroom suite. We loved it! They offer breakfast consisting of bagels, muffins, apples and bananas. There was oj, coffee and different flavored teas. We enjoyed the pool. We used it as much as we could. There is a hot tub. There are grills there is you want to use them. There is a fully equipped kitchen i.e. pots & pans, silverware etc. There is a dishwasher, washer and dryer as well. It is a well stocked apartment. We went to a nearby supermarket and bought food to cook. The suite we had had a balcony which I really enjoyed. I would make my coffee in the morning and sit outside to drink it. The beds were very comfy. The water was always hot when taking a shower. The tub was a whirlpool which my husband used and enjoyed.
They use a heavy scented deodorizer which you can smell immediately. The scent was strong and sometimes bothered my asthma.
They offer a shuttle to take you to the supermarket, Fremont.. it is posted in the elevator. It isn't on the strip but close enough to get to the strip quickly. There are many amenities here that I really enjoyed. There is a Denny's (don't recommend it) and a Walgreens walking distance.
The employees were always out and about and were friendly.
Two different older people seen me walking with my grandson and the expression on their faces showed they were not happy seeing a toddler. If you don't want to see children then an "Adults Only" is the place they should go to.
Our room was facing looking at another development which was perfect. I definitely would stay here again and plan on doing so.</p><br>it was ok<p>I like the location, but our room 308A was located next to soda machine and made a lot of noise, other then that room was clean and cozy I recommend not to get that specific room.
the check out time is too early considering las vegas night live.</p><br>Nice property, quiet, well maintained, but...<p>Overall Tahiti Vacation Club (Tahiti All Suite Resort) is a solid 95/100. No resort fees, free breakfast, and some great activities like year round heated pools, putting green, and planned activities.

Seems to attract the more mature crowd, which means it's usually very quiet and everyone you see will greet you. The rooms are basic but you have everything you need. Showers are hot, heat and AC keep the room comfortable, and the TV has some decent channels. Bathroom amenities are very very standard soaps and shampoos.. not much to brag about, but at least it's there. The kitchenette has everything you need to serve food and drink.

Front desk staff are helpful and I usually saw maintenance men around the property. You can really tell they take care of this place as nothing was broken or overly worn. Parking is COVERED and was plentiful the week I was there, although I find it hard to believe that the parking lot is big enough if the property was at 100% occupancy.

My only gripes are the scent they use either for cleaning or the carpet. It's a very floral/perfumy type scent that assaults the nose and actually sticks to your clothing. And then my only other gripe is that you're basically right near the intersection of Tropicana and Decatur, so if you have to take a left turn out of the property to go West on Trop, you'll either be waiting a long time or you'll have to go right and take a u-turn at the intersection.
Room Tip: I don't think studio rooms have a balcony, whereas the suites do. I think there's a bit more...
See more room tips</p><br>Great Family Resort and hidden Gem - October 2014<p>Resort was very quiet and family friendly - our party of 5 adults and two kids was perfectly suited for this place just outside the hustle of the Strip.

Continental breakfast every morning was an unusual bonus. The pool and spa were in great working condition, sand at the bottom of the kids pool was nice. The BBQ grill area was fantastic. The shuttle service was hourly to the strip which was a great help to us with a large group. Overall highly rate this resort and a super more quiet alternative to the sister resort the Tahiti Village. I heard their pools close at 4pm now, but the Tahiti was open all the time.

The only downfall I can think of is that there is no restaurant or bar on site, although there are several fast food restaurants within close walking distance.

Really enjoyed the fantastic service of the staff - always very pleasant and eager to assist us in making plans and catching the shuttle.

Tip: The New Orleans casino is walking distance, they have a buffet, a kids arcade, a bowling alley and other restaurants on site.
Room Tip: The resort permits you to upgrade from the 6 person until to the 8 person unit for an additional $14...

It is a nice quiet place away from the hustle and bustle of the Strip, but not to far. There is a shuttle but we did not use it. The Orleans casino is close by as are shopping centers. The pool is very nice. There are BBQ's that you can use. Bagels and coffee every morning. It was clean, well maintained and the staff was pleasant. There is covered parking. Timeshare sales pressure is very low. The concierge was not very helpful, he did not seem to know anything specific.
Room Tip: Get a one bedroom or larger.
See more room tips</p><br>October stay, 2014<p>This is our 4th or 5th stay at the Tahiti on Tropicana Ave. LV. We like it because it is quiet, has a full kitchen, very near a grocery store, 2 miles from the strip and the pools stay open! Our most recent stay included two couples. We rented the two bedroom or connecting one bedroom with the studio. We were very comfortable. Not sure why anyone would choose to stay in a hotel when you can basically have an apartment and be free to come and go. I say that because you are forced to leave your hotel room to obtain food or beverage.

Our room was equipped with all of our electronic needs. We had no trouble with internet access as previous reviewers had mentioned.

We will very likely return.
Room Tip: We prefer pool side balcony. Others may prefer balconies that face away from the hotel for more priv...
See more room tips</p><br>Tahiti in Vegas<p>We actually thought we were reserving at Tahiti Village and considered canceling, but decide to give it a try. We were pleasantly surprised. Everything was clean and well maintained. It would be a nice place for a family to stay. The pool in partially sand (kids would love), nothing fancy but a attractive fountain in the middle of the 2 pool areas. The hot tub has a small waterfall pouring into it. We had a studio suite which came with micro, coffee pot, refrigerator, toaster and plates, cups etc. So we could save a little money eating in. The breakfast provided is muffins, bagels, fruit, juice and coffee. A little awkward from where our room was to get to lobby, required going outside, but in nice weather who cares. My only recommendation would be to turn down the music around the pool area after ten. (Pool open 24 hours a day) Had to close my window to get to sleep. Otherwise happy with our stay.
Room Tip: Suggest asking for a room facing the pool area.
See more room tips</p><br>Tahiti Vacation Club was very good choice, again.<p>This was the second time staying at the Tahiti Vacation Club. We also have stayed at the Tahiti Village. We were very happy with our choice of the Tahiti Vacation Club. We're also glad we had a car rental for the week. It made it very easy to get to the strip and downtown without waiting for the shuttle. (If you decide not to rent a car, the shuttle works well too.) The one bedroom unit we had was located across from the elevator (303) and was so convenient to the lobby and pool. The unit was very clean and had all the kitchen equiptment we would need for a week stay. Loved having the washer/dryer in the unit too. Would definately stay there again.
Room Tip: Room 303 and 303A perfect for convenient locatiion to elevator.
See more room tips</p><br>Really relaxing place to stay<p>We just returned from a one week stay at Tahiti Vacation Club. This was a bonus week we used from Interval International. We have stayed before at their sister resort, Tahiti Village, so it was a good comparison. We loved Tahiti Vacation Club! It is very small, which we liked. The rooms are pretty much exactly like the ones at Tahiti Village as far as décor and layout. The location is actually better, being only about 2 miles from the Strip and we used all the back streets from the west side to get to the major casinos so we never had to drive on the Strip.

It does have a bit of a feel of an old converted apartment complex but the rooms are really clean and the pools are nice. We had a full 1 bedroom with balcony overlooking the pools on the top floor. They now have flat screen TV’s with HD and we were really happy that they had finally completed their wi-fi upgrade so that we were able to get internet in our room, and it was free! This was really important to me as I am self-employed and have to keep tabs on my business always. The connection was very good and pretty fast, so big thanks to them for finally getting that set up!

The pools have sand entry which was great for putting a chair in and just hanging out. They are not heated so if it is not really hot out, the water is too cold for staying in too long. The only suggestion we would have would be to change up the music out by the pool…..they pipe in Hawaiian style music which is cute at first and then gets really old. We never had a problem getting chairs and there is plenty of shade due to the buildings. We were able to get fresh pool towels with no problem, they brought them up to our room.

Everyone on staff there was really friendly and wanting to help. There was no pressure to do the timeshare presentation, we just declined when we checked in and that was that, no one called or left messages during the week. We checked in on a Monday afternoon and it was really fast and our room was ready.

We had a rental car so we did not use the shuttle service. They have covered parking and we did not have any problem finding a space anytime. There was only one elevator in our Building (A) and it was at the other end but we did not mind using the stairs, it gave us some exercise!

We had one maintenance issue with the garbage disposal and they were up in our room within 10 minutes repairing it! Really good service. We had one mid-week cleaning and never ran out of fresh towels or anything else. We did ask for a couple more dishwasher soap packets and she brought them right away.

So if you are not expecting super luxurious accommodations, this is a really great place to stay. Good location, wonderful staff, great pools and free internet! I would definitely return.</p><br></body></html>
