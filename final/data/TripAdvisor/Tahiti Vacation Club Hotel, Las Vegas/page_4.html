<html><head><h3>Tahiti Vacation Club Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 4</h3></head><body><br>Enjoyed our stay very much<p>My friend owns a timeshare at this location and we just spent 6 days there. I was pleasantly surprised during our stay. I wasn't sure what to expect since it's not located on the strip. This is my first time staying off the strip. Well I enjoyed it very much! The rooms are spacious. A full kitchen with amenities. There is a washing machine and dryer. I did not use it but how convenient! The bedroom is a nice size and the bed is comfortable. The bathroom has 2 sinks and spacious just like the other rooms. We went to the pool almost every day. It's a nice size with lots of lounge chairs and tables. We rented a car so we drove ourselves to the strip but there is a shuttle to take to to the strip so even though it's not that close to then strip, there is free transportation to it. I will definitely look to stay at this location when I visit next time! Thank you for a great visit!</p><br>Beautiful, clean and quiet!<p>Very clean, spacious rooms. Kitchen was stocked with plates, silverware etc., hair dryer, large TV, ironing board, nice seating area with flat screen and stereo, away from the bedroom. Pool area was gorgeous! Lots of palms, sand bottom pool, bbq area and hot tub. Pool was open 24 hours which was nice so we didn't have to worry about lots of other people. Breakfast was nice-bagels, fruit, juice. Would definitely stay here again!
Room Tip: We had a bottom floor room, which was great! We walked out our door and were at the pool. Very conve...

When we got there it was away from the strip as we planned. We checked in early with no issues and went to look at the room right away to see what it looked like. We were actually planning on looking up another hotel for our second day that was closer to the strip.

We followed the directions from the desk to easily find our room. We went into the section of the hotel where we were staying and right away it was obvious how clean the hotel was. We went into our room (one bedroom suite) and it was extremely clean also. We were right across from the pool behind the BBQ's. We weren't sure what type of kitchen it had inside of it and actually brought some of our kitchen ware to hopefully use for some of our meals. To our surprise, it had a completely full kitchen with all of the needed pots, pans, silverware, cups, and utensils. We actually went grocery shopping and made a fairly good size dinner when our family came over to visit.

The A/C worked perfectly the whole time even though it was a 108 degrees on both days we were there. Even with the additional people no issues at all. We kept it on the whole two days and it stayed in the 74 to 76 range the whole time.

The pool was pretty much a regular pool with the exception of it having sand at the entrance side in the water. The nice thing with the pool is that it is open 24 hours a day, so at 11 PM while it was still 104 degrees we were down in the pool with the kids. The other nice thing at the pool was there are multiple BBQ's (5 I believe) that are there for any of the people staying at the hotel to use at any time.

It was a nice hotel to be able to have family and friends come too and be able to entertain in the room with enough room for everyone to be able to hang out.

For anyone looking to gamble the hotel is a block down across the street from The Orleans hotel. I went over there a couple of time while the kids were swimming or just hanging out in the room. It was all of 5 minutes away.
Room Tip: The full kitchen makes a huge difference when making breakfast for the kids.

Check in/out was easy and the reception staff maintenancewere very helpfull throughout our stay. We had a small problem with the sink in our unit and the guy was there immediately to fix it. The room was clean when we arrived and housekeeping even washed the dishes for us! If you want to visit the strip there is a very reliable complimentary shuttle bus which runs a round robin from a few resorts in the area and only takes about 15 minutes. There is also plenty of places to eat and drink within walking distance of the resort. I would highly recommend the Irish bar and Sports bar near by for something to eat. There is also a Wallgreens right next door so you can easily stock up your fridge. The resort also runs a complimentary shopping bus a few days a week. The pools are great and even have sand at the shallow end. There is a lovely BBQ area and complimentary coffee all day in the owners lounge. Parking is easy and you can park adjacent to your apartment. Complimentary breakfast is basic, but enough. Overall we had a great stay and if we ever return to Vegas will definately stay again. Thanks guys for making the end of our road trip a week to remember.
Room Tip: Ask for a room with the balcany overlooking the pool or you will be overlooking the car park

Check in was a breeze, staff was so friendly, the property was very clean in general and our unit was spotless. Nice and quiet! I just have nothing but great things to say. Will definitely be back! Thanks for a great visit! Andrea Kroesen</p><br>The Best Stay EVER!<p>I use to be an Embassy Suites only person, until I stayed at Tahiti Resort, (not Tahiti Village). Tahiti Resort was amazing! Plenty of parking, and you could walk next door to Dennys. We had the 1 bedroom no smoking deluxe room with full kitchen, patio, 2 HD TVâ€™s and double sinks in bathroom. We were astonished at beautiful clean rooms the size of my first apartment. The wonderful staff made the stay even better. We had extra pillows, extra coffee, and the kitchen was fully stocked (just like home including a full size coffee pot, a blender, a tea pot, and a toaster.) I see on these reviews where people complain about housekeeping services; however we were delighted not to be concerned about the arrival of housekeeping. The room had a washer and dryer, and the kitchen had a dishwasher. My girls and I loved it here. There are two pools, a great Jacuzzi, and a barbecue area. If we needed anything extra, the staff just gave it to us at the front desk. We had a poolside room, on the first floor, and our car was just outside. We will be back soon!</p><br>Spouse weekend<p>Very clean and nice, very secure and friendly staff. Got a little confused with both locations but it was worth the confusion. Sandy pools are nice and warm and bbq area was spacious. Wish there was an elevator.</p><br>Good place to relax but still in Las Vegas<p>Quiet place to relax...nice pool area with plenty of chairs. Condos were spacious with all the necessary items (laundry, fireplace, full kitchen), Stay there because they provide a shuttle to the Strip and grocery store. Provide a free trip to Red Rocks Canyon, as well. Walgreens, Starbucks, Denny's and other stores are only a few steps away. Again being a major plus to why we chose to stay there. Most of the staff are friendly and helpful. Only had one negative experience---unescorted children in the hot tub at 9:00 p.m. when we didn't want to be splashed while they were snorkeling. When I reported it as a violation according to their post signage, the security man sided with the children believing that they were old enough to be unattended. Needless to say, we left them to their "snorkeling adventures" and did not return to the hot tub the rest of the week. I would suggest they change their signage or hired security staff who will enforce the rules. I know I was not going to assume liability in case of an accident.
Room Tip: Second or third floor on pool side.

It had a full kitchen with cabinets, utensils, stove/oven, washer/dryer, fireplace, utensils for BBQ at the pools, lounge, separate bedroom, and bathroom. Lots of space and furniture. Very clean, good location. Conveniently located. Nearby grocery stores, restauranta, all kind of stores. 12 min drive to downtown. I recommend it !</p><br>Off the beaten path (The Strip).<p>The place was in need of updating and cleaning, but it was sufficient for a place to sleep, shower, and have a bite to eat if you had your own food. There was a sink, microwave, and small fridge in the room, as well as a small table with two chairs. The pool area was nice but the water was very cold. It was advertised as heated, but was only warm during the day, possibly from the sun. The free shuttle to the grocery store and to the strip was very convenient and the drivers were polite and friendly. All the staff were polite and friendly, and answered any questions we had. If you prefer to be away from the strip, yet near enough to get there quickly, this is an adequate place to stay. Avoid the sales speech for timeshare, however. They say it will take 2 hours but it took all afternoon for us: about 4 hours. Not good. We actually stayed in September of 2013.</p><br></body></html>
