<html><head><h3>Tahiti Vacation Club Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 17</h3></head><body><br>Nice but not great<p>Stayed at the Tahiti Vacation Club for one week. Definitely on the low end of the scale for Interval International timeshare properties. But, being Vegas, I'm sure they have a huge volume of guests, so it is probably hard to maintain.

Cleanliness and general condition of the facility were ok. It definitely looks a bit tired needs work. It's an ok place to stay if you just want to sleep and do laundry. We had a 2BR/2BA unit and it was adequate. I will probably choose another timeshare property next time. The beds were comfortable, but the pillows were pretty flat, so you might want to bring your own.

Shower in main BA was not well maintained and temperature control was broken. TV remotes worked only sporadically. WARNING: There is NO AT&T cell phone service and only limited Verizon (hotspot) service, so you are forced to buy internet service if you want a good connection. This is one of the main reasons I will not stay at this property again. As soon as you leave the property, service is great.

The staff was nice enough. The location on Tropicana is fairly convenient.</p><br>The Staff Needs Work<p>First, let me talk about the good. The place is immaculately maintained. I had a two bedroom suite and I couldn't ask for a more beautiful room. It was very clean with all the utensils and cookware necessary. The bath/shower was excellent and the jaqcuzzi was first rate. Transportation to the strip was excellent. I had great shuttle drivers and being able to start at The Mirage each day was great. The shuttles were always on time. The gentleman who checked us out, Charles was very customer service oriented and should be commended for his work. Our concierge was a very nice fellow, understood customer service and was very helpful and courteous. Now, the bad. There is no communication between staff. I asked for a late check out when the reservation was made. I was told it was fine, just let the person who checked me in know. When I did I was told to just let the desk clerk know on Saturday. I let the desk clerk know Saturday night and she said she didn't know if it was possible. No one knew the policy or could make a decision and there was no decision maker avaiable. The owner of the timeshare was treated very rudely until I came down to straighten out a check in misunderstanding that I thought I had straightened out with the clerk on duty Thursday night when I arrived. Housekeeping entered my room unannouced on Sunday morning and that really concerned me. Also, and not the fault of the hotel, my GPS unit was stolen out of my car Sunday morning while I was loading up to leave. It is too easy for people who don't stay on the complex to have access to the resort. Would I stay here again? Yes, I love the place and the convenience of use was well thought out. The problem is the lack of communication with the staff. Unfortunately, this was key to my stay and what took what should have been an excellent experience and rating and made it average.
Room Tip: Get the name of the person you request something from, get it in writing, then enjoy your stay.

Had a courtsey bus to downtown if needed.We stayed 5 nights and could not complain about anything. We had a studio room with kitchenette which was great as we were able to have our breakfast in the room. The room was very clean and comfortable and was up on the second floor away from any noise. Hotel had 3 pools which we could see from our room. The grounds were in excellent order and the desk staff were very helpfull. If you want to stay away from the "madness" of the strip then I would recomend this hotel. It was great value for money.</p><br>No room at the inn but lots of paperwork<p>I booked a room about 3 months in advance. When I arrived earlier that the 4:00 pm check in time, I was given paper work to pre-register. When I returned after 4:00 pm to finish check in, I was told maintenance issues had made my room unavailable. I was sent to a sister property down the street. i was told this was an "Upgrade" At the sister property down the street, with rude bored front desk receptionist, I had to fill out the same paperwork again, and give my credit card for a deposit. I was then told that i was to go to a third property down the street. I drove to the third property. You guess it more paperwork! and i was told that the room was waiting to be shampooed. I was told there would be at least a half hour delay. When I finally got into a room, what a disappointment. Tiny narrow room. I talked to one of the "owners" on property they told me of the three clubs I had been sent to, this was the oldest and most run-down. Some upgrade for my inconvenience. I travel to Las Vegas about six times a year. I don't demand much from a hotel. Clean decent room with a minimum of hassle. I spent more time filling out paperwork (with a list of Draconian rules and fees) being shuffled from place to place and finally finding out I'd been shuffled off all the way to a run down resort. All I can say is way to hassle a customer and provide terrible customer service.</p><br>Issues with internet service<p>Spent a week here with my wife. We're both linked to our work by wireless service. Each laptop user is forced to buy wireless service individually at the Tahiti. Other places just charge one internet service fee for the room. Was disappointed to have to pay twice for two separate laptops for the week. They need to start a recycling program here. Hated to throw away newspapers, water bottles, magazines, etc. Only 1 washer & dryer to serve all the guests. You can see the water & power connections that show they used to have more installed. Proximity to the Strip & shuttle service were great. Staff was very friendly & accommodating. If we come here again, we will not stay in a studio - seemed short on both space & furniture. A sofa chair would have been nice.
Room Tip: Studio is suitable for one person. Couples & families should opt for a suite.

This place gives you more like a apartment feeling. Place itself is around 2-3 miles from strip. They have periodic shuttle but i rented a car so didn't bother to use that. Room is neat with all the basic facilities. Good part is the full kitchenette with microwave and refrigerator. So you can prepare your food if you want to. The negative part however is, they will clean the place only if you rent for 7 or more days. Otherwise, there won't be any house keeping for your stay. Also, the coffee maker carried only two sets. The breakfast is very limited (eseentially nothing simple bagel, juice and so normal coffee). Right next there is a Dennis. So it is bearable. Overall pretty decent place if you want to stay away from the strip.</p><br>Home away from home!<p>This hotel exceeded my expectations. Sure itâ€™s a while from the strip but they offer a free shuttle to the New York, New York hotel that runs every hour until 1:30 a.m. Among other destinations....
The cleanliness of this hotel is the first thing I noticed. Every time I turned my head I saw a maid or someone from hotel staff cleaning. The front desk is very friendly and greets you every time you enter and are leaving. Our room was like our own mini apartment...it was huge! We had a balcony overlooking the pool, which I highly recommend. The pool made me feel like I was staying In Florida or somewhere tropical...very relaxing!
My only complaint and its small is the breakfasts are very minimal. Coffee, juice, bagels and Danishes...and it ends at 10:00 A.M. Not good for us nite owls ;) But for the price I can't really complain too much. We got an amazing deal on this hotel!! Stay here if you want to save money and don't mind the commute to the strip.
Room Tip: Get a room overlooking the pool!!

We ended up with a "studio" which is basically a hotel room with a microwave, under the counter fridge, sink and toaster. The room is OK. It is clean and reasonably sized, but could be better furnished. There is very limited drawer space for unpacking clothes and a single tiny table. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The Internet service here is a rip-off. My husband and I both require Internet access for work on separate computers and the only way to get that in our room is to pay for 2 separate Internet packages at over $50/week for each computer. The service provider does not tell you that it will only work for one computer until after you pay for it and when we attempted to email the service provider, the email message bounced back saying that the email address was no longer valid. Not a good situation for couples who need to stay in contact with their employers while on vacation or families with multiple computers or devices.</p><br>Not quite the regular hotel grade<p>My wife and I stayed at the Tahiti during the latter part of September 2011. The property is a time share but they rented us our room as a hotel room. The construction is very poor. The walls are very thin. The bathtub/shower/spa in the room actually had the hot and cold indicators reversed! The pools were good with an outdoor hot tub that was good also.

When we wanted replacement towels for the pool (which are offered in the check in guide), we called the front desk and were perfectly willing to go there and exchange the used towels. The manager Jesse stated that they don't do that, they would have the towels brought to our room along with a set of clean regular towels for no charge. One hour later, no towels. We called and told Megan who was now at the front desk that we had not gotten any towels. We were going to lunch without going to the pool. We said they could deliver them to our room while we were gone. When we came back from lunch, we had the regular room towels but no beach towels!

We called again, offered to take our towels to them, Megan said they would deliver. We went to dinner and returned to find no towels delivered. Megan was surprised and apologetic. She said she would order them. No towels, we gave up. We did not go swimming that evening and left the next day. Wouldn't it have been easier to say that they did not have towels available or that housekeeping was not interested in delivering them?

Now for the breakfast or snack. It is very minimal. Only packaged pastry and bagels with coffee, tea and juice. No microwave to heat the pastry but 2 toasters for bagels.

The communication between the front desk and housekeeping was not functional for our requests. If you are going to run a hotel, check to make sure things work.

We will not stay here again.
Room Tip: We stayed close to the pool entrance area.

We upgraded upon arrival to the one bedroom suit instead of the studio. It had a full kitchen separate bedroom and fold out couch bed. Very clean room and modern. The room even had fake plant in it and it felt like home at a beach. The staff were very nice. The pool area was clean, not the giant mega resort style pool, however not busy like it either. The pools have sand areas for water lounging a jacouzi and three modern stainless steel gas bbqs. Perfect for a family get away. This is off the strip and there are several stores and inexpensive restaurants in the area. Only a 5 minute drive to the strip if that's your thing, if not no heavy traffic to the freeway or anywhere else in Vegas. Quiet. You will not regret the stay. Tvs are non flat panels but I don't veg out and watch tv in Vegas anyway. We love this place and made our next reservation for October before leaving. I will do another review then when I bring a steak to burn on the BBQ then.</p><br></body></html>
