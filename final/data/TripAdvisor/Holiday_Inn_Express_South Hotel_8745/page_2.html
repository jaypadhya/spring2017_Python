Under construction but not real noticeable. Breakfast was fresh and hot. the only reason I didnt give it 5 stars was due to thin walss and I could clearly hear the tv next door. Shuttle to the strip so I didnt have to drive!</p><br>outstanding friendly staff<p>I wen a week ago to this hotel.
Its far from the city center (15mnts by taxi).
a part from that the staff is fridnly, i mean very friendly. Mark, Recepcionist is a perfect example of a good recepcionist. He gave us tips for everything and more.
We only got one night there but was enough to be enganged. its not a kind of hotel to make some partys of even close. its to stay a couple nights, do some bussiness. if you want to have partys or a 5 star service you better choose another hotel. the breakfast had everything, pancakes, juice, coffee, scramble eggs and more. its not a hilton of course, but is really nice. once more, Mark is the face of this hotel! really friendly!</p><br>Quiet Yet Close<p>I stayed at this in July (24th-28th) as part of an annual road trip. It is easy to find, just off of the IH-15, take the Russell Road exit. Boom, across the highway from The Strip, it is close enough to enjoy all that The Strip has to offer, but far enough away so you are not caught up in the "crowds of visitors" that make The Strip what it is. It's shuttle service to the Aria and Mandalay Bay make access a breeze. Great drivers and regularly run. The hotel is undergoing renovation and my son and I happened to stay there when there was a high school basketball tournament going on so it was crowded, BUT...no noise, problems, no breakfast problems and the pool/exercise room were accessible as well. Grounds, public areas were well-maintained. Rooms were comfortable in every way. No complaints. Breakfast staff accommodated "everyone" I would think and the food was good and plentiful. Cleaning staff was taxed but they held their own though harried by the onslaught of "basketballers." I will stay there again when I go to Vegas and look forward to seeing the renovation. Great job, Holiday Inn Express - Las Vegas South.
Room Tip: Quiet ! No problems with noise. And this was with the "ballers" on board who were refres...

Tried to use the pool and had to have a staff member open it and there were numerous low class people in the pool area that made relaxing and getting some sun impossible. I tried to get a late checkout which as a Gold Ambassador member I should be guranteed. I had to checkout at 5:45am since I wanted to hike the Red Rocks area. Forced me to arrive at my next hotel in AZ extremely dirty / sweaty.</p><br>Nice and off the Strip<p>I have to come to Vegas frequently for business. It's not a party for me since I have to be up so early, and this is a clean, quiet place to stay. The employees are always very nice, and if you are interested in going to the Strip they have shuttles available.</p><br>Friendly Customer Service<p>This was a one-nighter and we chose this HIE because it was "on-the-way / off-The-Strip", and we needed a good night's sleep for another long day of driving. According to Google Maps, there was ample truck parking available. However, when we arrived, they were beginning the rennovations and a row of parking spaces behind the hotel were eliminated. Thankfully, we found space to park our truck.

The staff were VERY FRIENDLY and our check-in was QUICK and efficient. And when we entered our room, we found the renovations were definitely needed! The room looked clean enough, but didn't smell as clean as it could. The tub was stained and although not dirty, it was dingy. With that being said, the water pressure was AWESOME - what a WONDERFUL shower! Please don't change that plus during your renovations!

They have a shuttle service to the casinos, so you can definitely enjoy the life of The Strip AND come back to a quiet night's (or day's) sleep!

My only issues were the WiFi was slow and unreliable, (I had to use my MiFi to submit my reports) and we didn't get the Express Check-Out service. We left at 5AM - perhaps we left too early for Express Check-Out?

Thank you for your friendly customer service!</p><br>Presently renovating<p>This property is old and tired however it is under renovation, floor by floor, so will soon see what the newer fresher version will be. Way off the action of the strip which may or may not be a good thing depending on how you feel about that. There are shuttles that go every 30 minutes to Mandalay Bay and hourly to Aria, so it is not really that isolated. Know that the shuttle is shared with four other properties so can be full on occasion, however they try to get a second run to pick up the ‘stranded’ guests.
Even when only using three of four floors due to renovations, breakfast is crowed on weekends with nowhere to sit– mainly due to so many kids taking up table space – would not be here on a weekend again for this reason. Not sure why they have to vacuum the lobby at 9 am – so harmonious to have breakfast accompanied by loud vacuuming by someone who takes her job seriously hunting down every speck of dust.
Staff are great and overall would recommend this property</p><br>One night stay but will return.<p>The hotel was undergoing renovations but was kept extremely clean. Excellent housekeeping and front desk staff. They were all friendly and helpful. The room I stayed in had not been renovated. It was in good shape which was good to see that ownership/management is renovating before a property gets rundown. My only complaint was that there wasn't a refrigerator in the room. The General Manager got hold of me and said that as part of the renovation each room would be getting refrigerators & microwaves. That raised my rating from 4 to 5 and I look forward to staying here again. The hotel is in the southwest side of Vegas which made it very convenient to get around for business.
Room Tip: Be sure to join the IHG awards program.

The hotel is old, still allows smoking on the 4th floor, so, translation, people are smoking wherever they want to. I requested a room the furthest from the smoking area on the smoking floor and still had a strong smell of smoke in the hallway and in my room. Awesome. The rooms are not remotely sound proof at all, and I could hear everything from people walking up and down the hall, talking in their room next to me, and doing Lord knows what in the room above me. The furniture in my room was dingy and filthy. I put down towels on the office chair so I wouldn't get my clothes dirty. I'm pretty sure my sheets had not been changed, as there was evidence that someone had already been in the bed prior to me arriving. So.Gross. Believe me I would have left and found another place to stay, but I arrived late, nothing nearby was available, and I was stuck. Now I will say the hotel is going to be undergoing a MUCH needed renovation, but I doubt I will ever stay here again. And, I am a Platinum status with IHG and have stayed at numerous HIE's, so it is not that I don't like the brand, this particular property was a huge, huge disappointment to what I am accustomed to experiencing with IHG properties. The only positive thing is the staff I encountered were all very friendly and nice. But they are working at a sub-par property.</p><br>Over the road driver<p>I love this hotel and the staff they are the best very friendly very helpful and the rooms are always clean and nice they also have a shuttle that takes you to the strip shopping mall I would recommend this hotel to all my family and freinds</p><br></body></html>
