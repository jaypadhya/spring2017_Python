<html><head><h3>Holiday Inn Express Las Vegas South Hotel Reviews Page 9</h3></head><body><br>Very pleasant Oct. 05 to 12 2013<p>The staff is very friendly and made you feel very welcome. The hotel upgraded us and it was a very nice room. They had a shuttle that took us to the strip and shopping. The only thing that would of been nice if they picked you up from the airport. The breakfast was good that was supplied. The hot tub was broken which was not fixed during our stay.
Room Tip: The area where the hotel is quiet but you are not on the strip you are about 10 minutes away by car.

They provide shuttle service to Mandalay Bay and New York – New York so you can get within walking distance to most of the casinos. The shuttle (common to the hotels in the immediate area) also can be reserved for a return to the airport. The rooms are standard HIE offerings – nothing special.
Cons: There is no shuttle service from the airport. Be prepared to take a taxi (about $15 plus tip). If you pick up a rental car you must take a bus from the terminal to the transportation center. If you are not familiar with the area, make sure you download directions.</p><br>Nice Stay<p>This is a good place to stay on the fly when visiting in Las Vegas. They have a shuttle that will take you to the Mandalay Bay or New York New York. The shuttle is great! No having to get in the car and find parking if you want to walk the strip. Rooms are clean but be advise that there is no ice machine on the third floor. I found this out after walking the length of the third floor in socks only to get my feet wet as the carpet was soaked from those who were using the pool. After finding no ice machine in the usual places I had to go to the first floor to find the ice machine!
Room Tip: Be sure to get your ice before heading to your room if you are on the third floor. No Ice machine on...

They also have a morning Airport drop off shuttle. The taxi fare from the airport is about $25 to $30 one way. The room was clean and the hotel was fairly new. They offer free in room wifi and a good breakfast. The only problems we had were: didn't receive our wake up call, and they hadn't scheduled our morning airport shuttle, which we requested the night before. They were able to gets us on a shuttle that morning on time. I would stay here again.</p><br>Good value for trip to Las Vegas<p>We spent one night here during a weekend trip to Las Vegas with friends.
The room was spacious and there was free wifi, but unfortunately no fridge. I believe they were available at a charge, but think this is disappointing for a Vegas location.
The bed was huge and comfortable, although the room looked slightly tired, probably just due to the age of the building. It was certainly clean and only the lack of fridge would stop me staying there again.
We didn't get a chance to try out the pool area, unfortunately.
Thoroughly enjoyed the free breakfast! Lots to choose from, including hot items, toast, bagels, muffins, jams etc. The orange juice in particular was lovely. What brand is it!
Well located, and there was also a shuttle bus, though I can't remember which big casino places it stopped at.
Free parking included, which is a bonus, and the staff were really helpful.</p><br>Very, very average hotel with great customer service<p>This place was a very basic hotel, and that isn't saying much in Vegas. The customer service was exceptional, however, and it was very clean, so not bad if you are looking for an inexpensive off-strip hotel. I got my dad a junior suite for two nights and when we went to check him in the room was spacious and very clean. However the bed was quite large for the two small pillows on it and that looked a bit strange. The view from the window was almost totally blocked by the external part of the building. The strangest bit, perhaps, was that the clock radio looked very new, as did the rest of the building, but it played CDs and had no hook-up for MP3 players. Who travels with CDs anymore? I mean that's not essential, but the thing was huge and I just can't figure out why you would bother with such a massive, new piece of kit that very few people would use in this day and age. The pool was small and next to the parking lot, but blocked off by privacy fencing and very clean; we took my daughter swimming in it and it's good for kids. My dad said the breakfast was abysmal and he's not too picky, but I didn't see it first hand. Overall, if you're going for a short stay and don't want to be on the strip or are going for business on a budget, this is an ok place, mostly because the people working there were so incredibly nice, welcoming and accommodating at every chance to be so.</p><br>weekend get away<p>this is a very clean hotel great customer service friendly staff the rooms were very nice had a great nights sleep wonderful bed very comfortable. they had a good breakfast a wide choise .only a cross the freeway from the strip. lots of parking nice work out room.</p><br>Great value and location<p>I was so happy that we were NOT staying on the strip. This is just off the strip without all the noise and people. They have a free shuttle that will take you down but we did not have any problem driving ourselves and parking at the various hotels/casinos.

The beds were comfortable and the rooms were clean. You do hear the airport noise but it didn't bother me. The breakfast is why I love to stay at Holiday Inns. Love it!

Staff were super friendly
Room Tip: Stay on the second floor if you want to do your own laundry. That is where you will find the very re...

Ladder up for days in the lobby with wires hanging down. Cable TV service went out and they made it sound like Cox didn't even want to respond. Thermostat broken in the room so you had to control the AC at the unit with choice of blast or bigger blast - so without a thermostat you'd wake up around 2AM freezing. But the worst thing was the room REEKED of cigarette smell and when I complained about it at the desk when checking out the reply was "oh, you're right below the smoking wing and it comes through the vents" - if you know what the problem is FIX IT, my room was a non-smoking room!
Room Tip: If your room is on the third floor, west side and you don't smoke CHANGE your room - the smell o...

The access to the Strip and I-15 is easy. Been staying here for over 6 years on LV trips.
