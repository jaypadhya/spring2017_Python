<html><head><h3>Holiday Inn Express Las Vegas South Hotel Reviews Page 16</h3></head><body><br>Nice 1 Night Stay<p>My family stayed here on the night of November 5, 2011. We were in town for a family friend's anniversary party and found the hotel to be clean and the staff to be very friendly for the most part. We arrived early at about 12:30 pm and requested an early check-in, but were told that the computers were down and no rooms were available, which is fair enough since check-in is at 3:00 pm. We took the kids to another hotel for a bit and was able to check-in at 2:30 pm.

The room was clean, but did have a couple of problems. The handle on the toilet came loose and we had to have the maintenance guys take care of it, which they did in a timely manner. The other problem was with the loud a/c unit in the room. We had to shut it down for the night, which was ok since it was cool outside and we could crack the window open a bit for the night. Obviously, this would be more of a concern in the summer time, but for our stay it was ok.

The hot item complimentary breakfast in my opinion was one of the better ones we've sampled. We enjoy biscuits w/gravy, so we were happy with their scrambled eggs, sausage patties, biscuits and gravy. They also had a nice bread selection along with yogurt, juices, coffee, milk and bananas.

The breakfast staff and check-out staff were very friendly and easy to talk to. We got this room for only $66 including taxes on hotwire.com, so for a Saturday night we feel that we got nice value for our money.</p><br>Nothing fancy<p>The Holiday Inn Express South is nothing fancy. The hotel is showing its age and is need of a upgrading. The walls are thin and you can listen to the TV show your neighbor is listing to at 2 AM. The staff is helpful and kind. It’s a “value hotel” you get what you pay for. One thing is the hotel’s location is good and the shuttle to the MGM is a plus.
Room Tip: Shuttle to MGM and Mandalay Bay Resort

They kept me calm and kept my wedding dress safe until I picked it up. Everyone spoke to me when they saw me and are truly living the hospitality life. Brian made sure we made it safely to the hotel and even knew who I was on the phone. Nick made sure we made it everywhere we needed to go and was very genuine when he asked how our day was going! Again, the entire team is wonderful. Thank you all for being the GREAT people you are!!</p><br>Clean and cheap.<p>Clean rooms, decent breakfast, comfortable beds, great shower head/water psi-good for a short business overnighter, but far from any excitement. If you want a good night's sleep and easy free breakfast, this is your place.</p><br>Unremarkable.<p>There is not much to write about, because this hotel is quite similar to other Holiday Inn Expresses.

Std rooms are fine but you'll have to pay extra for a kitchenette. Pool is OK, but overlooks a parking area, street and a construction area. Breakfast is no different from other similar hotels.

We got this hotel through Priceline, which was considerably cheaper than the "rack" rate, but at that it is a reasonable value for LV, not the best I have stayed at.</p><br>Close enough to the action<p>I love travelling to Vegas, but have never wanted to stay on The Strip, so this Holiday Inn Express is perfect location wise. It's close enough to see Mandalay Bay from the front of the hotel, and the shuttle will get you on the Strip in about 5 minutes, depending on traffic.

The staff are friendly, and professional, the lobby area is clean, a little hectic during the breakfast buffet hours. The breakfast buffet is decent, well stocked, and organized. The pool isn't very large, but the area is well kept, and there are plenty of towels available. I've used the exercise room once, and it's well equipped with modern cardio equipment. Only drawback is that it's located on the first floor right across from the breakfast area, and front desk, so it's like working out in an aquarium as people walk by and look at you. I appreciate it's not isolated, but a little privacy wouldn't hurt either.

The guest laundry room on the second floor is a great convenience, especially when you're living out of a suitcase during your trip.</p><br>not the best Holiday Inn express I stayed in and I have stayed in a few.<p>The towels were hard and fraying on the ends. They need to get new ones. On the first day it smelled clean and the subsequent days the maid came in and straightened up but didnt clean the toilet and I got the same towels even the ones I left on the floor. Also noticed that the first night me and the other guest were evenly spaced with an empty room in between. I could tell by the placement of the newspapers. the subsequent night they stacked us all up on one side. Not good for the noise level. Oh and the toilet didnt have that thing accross the top. It was crumbled up and thrown in the corrner which made me think it wasn't cleaned before i got there. No places to eat nearby. No ATM Machine nearby.</p><br>Take rest here for the hectic time ahead..<p>Clean hotel with value for money, little away from the famous "Strip". A cool and calm place just to get rest after a hectic day out or night out. Complementary break fast and shuttle service to Strip is a definite plus point.</p><br>Consistent chain - good if you don't want the Vegas feel<p>We stayed here when we were traveling thru Vegas. It's the perfect inexpensive hotel if you're not looking for the Vegas feel. It's clean, the rooms are nice, bedding is higher end then other similarly priced hotels.... It's a Holiday Inn Express and it's always helpful to have free parking and wifi.</p><br>Just Ok, look elsewhere<p>Arrived in Vegas late on a Saturday night and a day early for our Luxor check-in. We were tired and just wanted to lay down instead of fighting the strip crowd to check in early at the Luxor. Spent the previous 8 nights on the road and stayed in HIE on 5 them. This one was OK but a step below what we had experienced in the others in California. Room was nice and cool, bed was comfy. Breakfast was terrible. Breakfast area was packed. They had obviously watered down the food. Paid $139 which I felt was a little high. One luggage cart. Nothing horrible, nothing special.</p><br></body></html>
