<html><head><h3>Holiday Inn Express Las Vegas South Hotel Reviews Page 3</h3></head><body><br>Simply Super <p>After our look at our Yucky room at the Luxor and checking out, we found this HIX about a mile away with an available suite and got a comparable rate. We were checked in by Luis, a fantastic desk clerk who helped us get our vacation back on track. Our suite was wonderful, very spacious and clean. The breakfast was wonderful and always well stocked. Skip the Strip and stay at this great property that is close to the airport.</p><br>Quality of service<p>Soon after arrival and check in we discovered we had a very early bus pick up for a local tour. Our bus was leaving before the complimentary breakfast kitchen would be open. Upon hearing of our situation, the front desk made arrangements for bagged breakfast to go, to be picked up at front desk as we left for the day.</p><br>So thoughtful!<p>Luis was awesome! Our flight arrived very early. Luis called my cell as soon as a room was ready, and worked hard to connect us with our tour people, who were scheduled to pick us up at the hotel, but we're late. This is very excellent service, we say "5 Stars!"</p><br>Holiday trip <p>Excellent hotel, very CLEAN, friendly staff and a good option if you want a reasonable priced hotel off of the strip. There is a shuttle which takes you back and forth to the strip - which was great since we didn't have a car. The breakfast was OUTSTANDING. I was very impressed by the hot breakfast selection. I was so impressed by this stay that I joined the IHG Rewards Club so that I can stay at these hotels during my travels. It is definately far off the strip (5 min drive on interstate) so make sure you are aware of that when making your plans.</p><br>Excellent hotel away from the busy strip<p>We arrived in Las Vegas late in the evening on our way
to Death Vally, CA. We didn't want to spend big bucks
for a hotel on the strip since we were just passing through
and found this hotel that's only a block off the strip on
the better end for $114 with tax for a very nice king room.
The bed was fantastic and one of the best showers ever.
Wifi was good and the free breakfast bar was good also.
If you want to stay in Vegas without the high price
this is a great alternative.
Room Tip: The higher rooms have a good view of the strip
See more room tips</p><br>Off the Strip<p>Its off the strip so its generally quite. I stay for 9 nights on business and had very few complaints. The service was good. I was promised a top floor room which I didnt receive, the breakfast was great but served late on 3 days and the internet was slow. Otherwise the shuttle service was great, parking was plentiful, food and lemonade were great and the exercise room was decent.</p><br>Excellent All Around!<p>We visited from CA and spent 3 nights second week of June. Check in was easy and fast by Rob at the desk. He is very professional and quick with any question we had - kinda had an easy going southern hospitality thing going on.
The hotel is close the freeway and just minutes from the strip. Getting a shuttle was easy, and was on time every time.
Room was exceptionally clean and close to ice machine. The pool and spa were good and have a great view - looked fairly new too! The only minor flaw was housekeeping providing one bar of soap for a family of four..... but the plus side was how friendly the housekeeping staff was when we asked for more soap. If your looking for a hotel that does everything really well, then stay here. Oh, I almost forgot to mention how excellent the free breakfast is! Rob said it would be good, and he was right!</p><br>Great Service<p>This Holiday is in the best location they shuttle you to the strip which is great it takes about 5 minutes . The price is great for Vegas you have more to spend on other things ! We were surprised with the amount of security we felt very safe . The staff were very friendly and helpful .</p><br>Top Notch Hotel<p>Great Stay, Great Breakfast, Convenient location...Staff was excellent, quick and easy check in, and a location that was convenient to my business activities.
Close to freeway and lots of Free parking.</p><br>Wonderful staff &amp; breakfast attendant is amazing kid.<p>Highly recommend if you want to stay low key in Vegas. Excellent shuttle survice to major attractions in Vegas. We went to Vegas to meets old friends and decided to stay in a low key hotel with shuttle survice and picked Holiday Inn Express.</p><br></body></html>
