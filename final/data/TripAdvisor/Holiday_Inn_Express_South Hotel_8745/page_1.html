<html><head><h3>Holiday Inn Express Las Vegas South Hotel Reviews Page 1</h3></head><body><br>change of the hotel<p>We suppose to stay in Holiday inn resort close to the strip,but as per info from Holiday inn we were moved to Holiday inn South which is away from the strip in industrial area.We were told tourists do not stay there.Hotel was in process of remodeling,it was still ok.Major problem was shuttle to the strip. Bus suppose run every hour on the hour till 1 AM.First night was good,bus came 10 pm.Second night we were waiting from 10.45 pm to midnight,bus did not show up.We managed to find phone and phoned to hotel and were told bus stop running at 8PM without any notification.We end up taking taxi to get back to the hotel.Got 3 different explanation why bus stop running,hotel reiumberest us for taxi.</p><br>Nice and Comfortable<p>This is a nice hotel close to Strip and they have a free shuttle to take you over to the Strip. The room was clean, linen and towels clean and hot water for shower, free wifi and free breakfast. Breakfast is descent. I would stay here again as I had a good overnight experience.</p><br>A fantastic choice for a weekend in Las Vegas<p>I stayed at this hotel while attending a wedding at The Four Seasons, Las Vegas, which is very close to the HI Express (visible from the parking lot) in the Mandalay Bay complex. I am a long timeHI Priority Club member. The only down side I found all weekend was the $24 cab ride from the airport (HIE does not provide a shuttle from the airport but provides free shuttle service TO the airport if you book it in advance at the desk). When I first arrived at the hotel, there had been a water main break and water service was scheduled to be turned off the next morning at 10 a.m. I was not pleased as I had no fewer than 3 wedding events to attend the next day. The hotel provided me with as much bottled water as I needed and completed the repair very quickly. The manager reduced my room rate for the repair day by 50%.

This hotel is newly renovated and my room on the top floor was really nice. King size bed, chaise lounge up against the window, plenty of outlets and chargers, microwave, fridge, flat screen tv with many channels, coffee maker. The bathroom was large and the shower was hot, with good water pressure. Two types of window coverings to filter the sun or totally block it out, at your election. Breakfast was great, with the usual HiE choices along with pancakes you can make yourself using an automated pancake machine. The breakfast ladies were fantastic and worked very hard to feed the sold-out hotel. The hotel offers free tea and coffee in the lobby, 24/7. No restaurants in the immediate vicinity but there is a gas station convenience store where you can purchase soda, milk,beer and snacks.

The hotel runs a free shuttle to Mandalay Bay/The Four Seasons every half hour and to The Aria every hour. Please tip the driver!

Special shout out to Shauntavia at the reception desk, who went above and beyond for me numerous times during my stay!!</p><br>Great stay<p>My family and I stayed in this hotel during our trip to Vegas. We loved the location and our room was immaculate. I think the best sleep of my life was in their beds! I've been trying to find the brand of pillows they use, but no luck so far. All that aside the place was well kept and the only complaint I had was when we tried having breakfast at their restaurant. It's way too small for the size of the resort and was packed when we went. Overall a great stay, though.</p><br>Ups and downs<p>Ups- well set up rooms-Comfy beds-free breakfast - Accomodating staff-Close to Freeway- Next to Terribles Mini mart- close to strip- the best black out shades!!!!!!

Downs- thin walls, under construction - next to "crazy horse gentleman's club" and industrial area , same average breakfast daily which proteins were powdered eggs and grey sausage.

Since it was under construction, the water was turned off for eight hours- but staff gave us 50% off one night of room- next door hotels had great bathrooms!</p><br>Nice place but housekeeping needs work<p>We stayed here for 4 nights. The room was very nice and one of the newly renovated. The room was clean and nicely layers out. The morning breakfast was the usual fair. Very tasty and always fresh. The shuttle to the strip was a life saver and very easy to get back and forth. The front staff were very well informed and friendly. The only draw back this trip was the house keeping staff. Our coffee was never replenished during the day. 2 of our mornings they took the dirty towels but forgot to give us any clean ones. All was fixed with a phone call to the front desk, but this got tiresome every day.</p><br>Not as usually gives this hotel chain.<p>Hi

This is my worst experience at this hotel chain. First the A/C only works at hi (no low or middle speed) speed and make lots of noise. And in the middle of the night some kind of engine/motor below our room starts making lots of noise and all the floor vibrate more than tolerance, I had to admit that they shut down manually after call reception but I lost the sleep almost 2 nights. Dont accept room 241 if you wanna sleep.

For the other sites now the rooms are renovated pretty nice.</p><br>Home away from home<p>Upgrade efforts are much appreciated. Pleasantly surprised with the amount of work and the over all feel of the new decor. Would not hesitate to recommend this place to anyone. I look forward to future visits and am very comfortable that any and all concerns will be met with courteous and professional help. Please keep up the good work as us weary travelers truly appreciate all the amenities.</p><br>Family visit<p>Enjoyed the quiet and smoke-free hotel. Friendly and helpful staff. Third stay at this hotel and great experience each time. Hotel is very clean and comfortable altho under renovations. Close enough to casinos and activities but far enough away from loud traffic and businesses. Breakfast offered with variety of choices. All look great.
Room Tip: Each room stayed in was good. Comfortable beds!
See more room tips</p><br>one night stay<p>The hotel is being totally refurbished. I must admit the new modern decor and colour scheme is not to my taste but this is not really an important issue. There was a large ugly rusty chip area in the bath which is strange considering that the bathroom looked refurbished. Great free breakfast and fridge, microwave etc in the room. Free regular shuttle to the strip. Altogether we would have been very happy here but unfortunately we had a neighbour who decided to watch TV at intervals during the night and the dividing walls did not cut out the sound very much at all. Result...we didn't get much sleep.</p><br></body></html>
