I think my total was about $100 and for a Wednesday night in Vegas, thats a tad much for what you get in a city like this mid week. Am in town another day and am moving to the Nellis location up north. Have stayed there and is a lot cleaner/upgraded Express. Not the worst hotel I've stayed in by any means but I frequent Express' due to the pretty basic high expected standards. My carpet had stains on it, the bathroom was dingy, the tiling in the tub and tub itself was out of date and had dents in it. For half the price, could have stayed at Caesars, Paris, Planet Hollywood, etc. Also just before midnight kept hearing a weird loud drilling sound I believe to be plumbing related.</p><br>Good value near the strip hotel. Great for families!<p>A relatively new hotel that is near the strip. Clean and spacious rooms. Offers shuttle to few hotels on the strip.</p><br>Very nice hotel. Clean, helpful staff, full breakfast, free shuttle, near the strip.<p>I like this hotel... Good location, near the strip. (can not walk the strip, but OK... they have free shuttle)
Complimentary full breakfast that I like... Coffee, tea, cereals, banana, pancake, egg, yogurts, milk, biscuit, jams, peanut butter, cheese, bagels... what you need... you can find everything...
And helpful staff...</p><br>Great Value<p>This is a welcoming great value hotel. Clean and very helful staff. Shuttle bus t/from the strip. No frills Holiday Inn Express but if that is what you need it is a great find.in high cost Las Vegas. It has a pool but we did not use it. No resteraunt but does provide a very good breakfast.
$20 cab ride from airport.</p><br>Close to strip, easy access<p>Stayed here on a family vacation with a Priority Club Points Break promotion, and it was a good value (for points). The hotel is not new, but it has been refurbished and is in good condition. The pool area, despite being between the parking area and a road, is clean and pleasant with a few palm trees. We had no problems and I would recommend the property. No restaurants in the immediate area, but access to the south end of the strip and I-15 couldn't be easier. The internet was fast, but no HDTV.</p><br>Great Service, comfortable beds, excellent breakfast<p>This was a deal! I would definitely stay at this hotel again. The beds were comfortable and the breakfast was excellent. I would recommend they don't use such heavy blankets on the beds, though.</p><br>Good for businessmen and travelers, bad for contractors with early hours<p>Rooms smaller than other HEI's that I stay in. Refriderator pathetically small, same with microwave - plan on shopping daily for food if you don't eat out. Enjoyed brewing coffee in the bathroom. Below verage breakfast compared to other HEI's, but never out early so if you need to head out before 0630 hours, plan on eating elsewhere. No washer/dryer on sight. Don't want room service?-no problem, they'll call you daily anyway to remind you daily. Elevator #2 seems to be the primary floor mover, and sounds like it's ready to fall apart. Don't know about Nevada, but every motel I stay at has an inpection sticker/operation permit posted to the elevator - not this place. Staff is friendly, but manager seems to be the only one really concerned about guests.</p><br>Unbelievable Service from the staff at this Holiday Inn Express<p>We planned to stay at this Holiday Inn Express on our first and last night in Las Vegas before and after staying at a Casino. We were arriving late and leaving early and thought that we could save a few dollars this way. Our expectations were not very high. We never expected the level of Customer Service that we received for Brian,Travis, and Ginelle at the front desk. We had a few issues with shuttles and directions and these guys were unbelievable! We'll probably never see them again, but I feel like we made a couple of friends for life. By far the best customer service we received on the entire trip. Ceasar's Palace would be a better place if they would have their entire staff trained by Brian and Travis.</p><br>Dated interior, ho-hum service, average at best<p>Stayed here the past week for business. The location is very close to the strip, airport, etc. and the exterior of the hotel and grounds are pretty nice. That's pretty much it for the good points. I found the service to be ho-hum at best - the staff pretty much ignored me in my comings and goings - no recognition of Priority Club membership, no offer for a bottled water, nada. The halls and rooms are pretty tired, old TVS and decor. The workout room was really tiny and the "Business Center" was a table set up next to the check in desk. Next time I'm in the area for business I'll plan on staying somewhere else.</p><br>Nice<p>We were staying at this hotel because we were driving to las Vegas from Los angeles, shops are located near by like CK and Guess? and places like that. The hotel was quite cheap and it was a nice area. We got 2 double rooms, the rooms were nice and cozy, the bathroom was really nice (and there was a lock on the door !). The hotel lets you have snacks at anytime in the place where you eat breakfast, it offers cookies and a variety of drinks. Good Tv channels and a beautiful view. continental breakfast was nice, scrambled eggs, bacon,sausages, giblets, sauces, pastries, yogurts just a nice variety. overall a nice stay</p><br></body></html>
