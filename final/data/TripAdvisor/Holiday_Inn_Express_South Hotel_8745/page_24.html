<html><head><h3>Holiday Inn Express Las Vegas South Hotel Reviews Page 24</h3></head><body><br>liked this hotel<p>enjoyed our stay here although we had some difficulty finding it as there are 2 roads called polaris avenue and we cruised up and down the wrong one. once we found it we were very happy with it. Nice room, good size, clean. We had a car so were happy with the location. Nice breakfast, not too busy, good price for Las Vegas, would stay again</p><br>Very overrated, taxi rides will cost you a fortune!<p>Stayed at the Mandalay Bay mdiweek until it got to expensive and booked this on Hotwire at $92.00, after seeing it had the 7th best customer satisfaction rating. First off, the person checking us in insisted on putting my 18 year old daughter and I in a king size bed with me because "that was what Hotwire had us down for. She did not seem to understand that there was something quite wrong with that. After going over her head and having the great vibe of our vacation taken away, we managed to get two double beds. This hotel is fine for someone resting their weary head on a business trip, however it is not suitable for a vacation style hotel. The pool lacks any charm and the area is "devegetated". For a few more bucks I would strongly suggest booking a better hotel. This hotel is in the middle of nowhere and any savings on the room will be eaten alive by taxi rides. I have been to Vegas over 100 times and this place is truly near the bottom. They do have free wireless which is nice and a small size workout room.</p><br>Just one negative<p>I have to agree with most of the reviews. A nice property and the staff was just great. Especially keeping in mind that this is Las Vegas. I enjoyed not being in a casino hotel for this trip. The only negative for us was that the walls are thin. Noticable sound from the next room. Guest there seemed to think that you have to yell into a cell phone. Sound problems from other rooms is not typical for HIX</p><br>VERY Clean Hotel<p>Not within walking distance to the Strip, but free shuttle. We had a rental car and parked for free at the hotels. Very easy in/out parking at hotels. Did notice that the buses on the Strip were always crowded, even on Mon./Tue. This is a VERY clean and newer hotel. I am very particular about a hotel being clean. I even look at caulking lines around toilet to make sure they are clean. Coffee maker and tea bags in room, along with blow dryer and ironing board. Bedding was great. You have a choice of firm or soft pillows. No frig or microwave(would have been nice). No ice machine on 2nd floor(which we were on). Did not hear any outside noise(not even the planes), but the floors are very thin. People above us came in around 3:45 AM and sounded like they opening and closing their dresser drawers over and over again and just walking around for about an hour. Even the A/C couldn't hum that out. Would get top floor next time. Lobby area was very clean, front office staff very friendly(Brian) and helpful. Good variety for breakfast. Entrance of hotel had a great variety of coupons and magazines with coupons. Someone earlier mentioned the neighborhood was shady around hotel. I did not find that to be the case at all. Not much to really do withing walking distance from hotel. But who needs that when you have the Strip. This hotel is closest to the bottom 1/2 of the Strip. Spent 2 days here and only completed 1/2 hotels on the Strip. Hotels are farther apart than they seem on the maps. Was there on a Monday and Tuesday and did not notice the lines to be long at all. Was still pretty busy during the night even though it was during the week. Was worred about all I've heard about people standing on the side of the street handing out mini flyers of 1/2 dressed women(they did that but were not pushy at all), but not one tried to hand them to us since we had small kids with us. Had the buffet at Terrible's and it lived up to it's name. Yuck!</p><br>Fantastic hotel<p>Stayed at this property for two nights during our month long road trip of California and Nevada and we were not disappointed. Charming friendly and very helpful front desk staff (all of them). Fabulous room, large, extremely clean and with lovely new fresh white bedding (you can buy this online after you leave). Perfectly adequate free breakfast.

We asked for a room overlooking the strip on a high floor (about 1 mile away) as suggested by a previous reviewer. These are to the front of the hotel and we were surprised as to how close the strip seemed (great pictures taken at night) but without the incessant noise and hustle and bustle. Be warned however, there is a building plot directly in front of the hotel and once built on will obliterate this view completely. Building works next door but no noise heard at all. All in all a wonderful experience and we would not hesitate to highly recommend this property and it's location.</p><br>Stay Here! Excellent Hotel<p>Yes, I felt silly saying I was going to Vegas and staying at the Holiday Inn Express. But that faded away when we checked in. The staff was friendly and the service was impeccable. The room was clean, no hints of smoke ANYWHERE in the hotel. The pool was excellent, never crowded (we usually had it to ourselves). The beds were incredibly comfortable, and the hotel was quiet so we got lots of sleep (check other hotel reviews, you won't find that elsewhere). There was construction next door, but we never heard it while inside. Breakfast (FREE) was excellent, fresh warm cinnamon rolls, variety of juices, cereals, bagels, waffles, fresh fruit, yogurt. The bathroom and the shower - excellent. We used the shuttle to the Mandalay Bay often, and again, were very impressed.

I wanted to rest and relax at my hotel during my stay, and the Holiday Inn Express was PERFECT for that. I didn't want a "party pool" or a smoke filled hotel room just to say I stayed at one of the famous hotels. When I return to Vegas, I'll stay here again.</p><br>Good value off-strip haven!<p>Stayed here at the end of April after flying in to Vegas from the UK. I wanted somewhere off strip so that the noise and madness was optional, and that's exactly what we got! I'd echo all the positive comments below about comfort, cleanliness, value etc and there's not much more i can add on that front.

we stayed here two nights, then did a driving tour of California, then back to Vegas for two nights on the Strip, so can compare both options. In summary, i'd suggest this place is perfect for independent minded people who want to experience Vegas without the inconveniences of the big Strip hotels - lines for everything, hit and miss service, etc. Oh, and who don't mind at least one person not drinking at dinner so they can drive back, tho a cab is only $10 or so from the near end of the strip, and the HI do provide a shuttle bus option too.

I heard no airplane noise either. Really don't know what's going on with that, unless the flight path changes based on wind direction or something.

A few particular positives about this hotel, and i guess being off strip in general:
- no long traffic queue to get to the hotel, no long walk from the car park, and no lines to check in. We could have been in our rooms within 10 minutes of picking up the rental car.
- it's quiet - no drunken groups in the hallways at night, or shrieking cleaners in the hallways in the morning!
- breakfast included - and by UK standards, a large and thorough breakfast! yes you might want to go pig out at a buffet afterwards, but it's nice to have the option of at least a quick coffee / snack first if you want a slower start to the day.
- POOL & hot tub were a big plus because there was never anyone in them! You'll never get any part of the pool to yourself in one of the big hotels. And, it was open until midnight if you fancied a dip before bed, which i love. Strip hotels tend to close their pools quite early, i guess to stop drunk people falling in them or something, i don't know!

Only negative we found - aircon was pretty much on or off, and a bit noisy.</p><br>welcoming and helpfull staff<p>what a great hotel just a shame it is off strip! apart from that i couldnt fault it. it was clean the staff were very informative and the free breakfast was a good start to the day.we stayed for 3 nights and then were booked into the luxor for the rest of our stay if we had have known before booking how nice it was we would have probably not bothered with the luxor!!!(this is another reveiw i have to write but not good!!) the room was i good nice size clean smelling and the beds comfortable. we were on our 5th travel expedition to america and always like to wonder about and do our own thing without being bothered and the hotel was very helpful when we needed to get to somewhere but didnt bother us if we didnt need anything. the shuttle bus was helpfull if you wanted to get to the strip without driving.well done to all the staff for our pleasant stay we would certainly return and have told lots of friends about you.</p><br>A great hotel for the money!<p>I searched long and hard for an affordable but clean hotel for our three-night Vegas stay. Trip Advisor reviews were very helpful.
Our room at the Holiday Inn Express was squeaky clean. All amenities were as described. The beds were quite comfy despite my bad back! Staff was friendly and helpful. We enjoyed the varied continental breakfast each AM and what a timesaver...no long lines at a casino breakfast buffet. Some reviews spoke of airport noise but the a/c fan drowned out any plane noise, which was sparse to begin with.
We had the spa and pool to ourselves each evening. Parking was close and convenient and no lines at the front desk for check in.
Sure, it's not on the strip, but only a short drive takes you there. We did not use the free shuttle to the Mandalay.
Quiet, clean, and just $109.00 per night (AARP price)...who could ask for anything more? A good birthday trip.</p><br>Great place!<p>We are currently guests at the Holiday Inn Express On Polaris in Las Vegas. After having thoroughly read all the reviews for this hotel, I decided it sounded like a good deal to me. We were able to book this room with 25000 Priority Club points per night. We found the hotel very easy to get to from the car rental station at the airport. The whole hotel smells clean and fresh, and the beds here among the finest I have ever had at any hotel. Although the hotel is very airport handy, and others have written here complaining of airplane noise hindering their sleep, I can say that I never heard a plane fly over the entire 3 days we have been here. The Air conditioning units have a fan setting that allows you keep the fan running constantly ( heat or air) and that must act as white noise to cover the noise from the airport very well. The AC is a window type unit, but it is controlled by a thermostat on the wall. Always a plus staying at any HI Express is free continental breakfast and free in room wireless hi speed internet. Breakfast is identical of course to any HI Express.

I am in room 324, and the view from my room includes several hotels on the strip ( from the backside) including the Bellagio. (My view also includes the interstate, so don't think I am saying it's just like staying on the strip!)

We are in an "executive" room, which does have a small refrigerator and microwave and coffee maker, along with a sofa sleeper and coffee table. This the last night of my 3 night stay here, and I have slept like a baby the last two nights. The front desk staff has been very helpful in offering information about the hotel and the area, the shuttle to Mandalay Bay, and back routes to strip hotels during rush hour.

It's just been a great place to stay, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a comfortable and clean place to stay in Vegas, i you don't mind being a little bit away from the strip.</p><br></body></html>
