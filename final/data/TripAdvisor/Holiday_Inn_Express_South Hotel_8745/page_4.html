<html><head><h3>Holiday Inn Express Las Vegas South Hotel Reviews Page 4</h3></head><body><br>Great Hotel off Strip<p>We stayed here after visiting the Grand Canyon and had a car. The parking was free and by having a car we were able to see more of the area. The Hotel is great. Clean, spacious, quiet, safe, free Wi-Fi, free breakfast, free shuttles to the strip and I think a free shuttle to the airport. We did not use the shuttle as we had the car. The pool is OK, certainly not luxury resort, however our kids had fun. There is a laundry in the hotel if you need to catch up when travelling around with a family. You can drive to the Outlet Malls, In-n-Out Burger and Town Square which are not too far away. Without a car it would be too far to walk, so I guess grab a cab. The staff were friendly and helpful & there is a business centre to print out boarding passes etc... Not five star however for the price we paid I would recommend staying here with a family.</p><br>Western Region Manager<p>I stay almost exclusively at HIEx. I rate this one the best of the best. Extra details, each staff member gives me individual attention n checks on me daily to see if there is anything they can do for me as they know I have a hectic schedule. CCW</p><br>Home away from home<p>This hotel has the best customer service clean rooms and very comfortable beds, I would recommend this hotel to anybody who coming to vegas the location is great and the shuttle service is fantastic and you can't beat the price</p><br>great stay<p>the hotel is located a little away from the airport and around 20 minutes walk from the shopping and gambling areas. the rooms and staff were very good. its priced well for its standards. food is slightly on the expensive side but there are a few supermarkets around the hotel so you can pick some sandwich etc. overall i had a very good stay.
Room Tip: take rooms facing the front of the hotel

Everything else is what you would expect but Ashley goes above and beyond! I seriously have not had a better experience with a front desk agent. Words can't express how good she is.</p><br>Business<p>Excellent, good and friendly staff. The view of the strip is nice. The pool and spa are relaxing. Love the king size beds. If you're going to stay in Vegas then may I suggest the holiday Inn. With a free shuttle ride to the strip and breakfast. What more could you ask for</p><br>Clean but Dated<p>This is a decent property, nice and clean, but truly outdated. I notice it is scheduled for renovation in the very near future. That is great.

The location is great. Once updated, this will be an awesome facility.</p><br>Nice stay<p>As a Platinum member we almost exclusively stay at IHG properties both this place and Staybridge next door our great alternatives to the big Casino hotels and offer some great value and still have nice accommodations. Right off the freeway it is a quick jaunt to the strip, I highly recommend this for those that want good value and a nice stay.</p><br>Relaxing stay, hot breakfast &amp; close to the strip<p>Stayed here during my first trip to Vegas and loved it. I am a faithful to the Holiday Inn brand and this property surely impressed. The property was clean, the staff was polite and helpful - even at 2am with directions. The property had a great view of the strip, of which we walked to and it wasn't too far. Loved the outdoor pool and hot tub. Both were the perfect temperate and impeccably clean! Loved the breakfast too - sausage gravy and biscuits were my favorite, and hubby fueled up on sweet cinnamon rolls. Definitely a great property - highly recommend.</p><br>Business trip<p>Consistent with Holiday Inn Express the facility was clean, attractive, staff was pleasant and helpful and it was an enjoyable business stay, Breakfast staff was pleasant and attentive. Pool and workout area was clean and adequate.</p><br></body></html>
