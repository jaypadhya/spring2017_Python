<html><head><h3>Holiday Inn Express Las Vegas South Hotel Reviews Page 8</h3></head><body><br>returned and it got better<p>I had to make a trip to Vegas during super bowl weekend. I was expecting problems with hotels, and anything else I wanted to do because this place gets crazy during SB weekend.
WOW, was I pleasantly surprised. called the hotel and gave them my priority number (now its the IHG club) and got a room right quick. service was awesome just like the last time I was here a year ago. The wife and I were comfortable in the King sized bed and the breakfast was very good with scrambled eggs, sausage, and biscuits and gravy. MMmmmm. we were there for 3 days, I had to work in the mornings, but the rest of the day we were off to the races...LOL
Every time we returned to the hotel we were warmly greeted and asked if we needed anything.
I felt like a king....thanks IHG!!
PS. please put Coke products in some of the machines, my bride of 25 years like pepsi, but I wont drink it. I had to walk to the Terrible's and purchase drinks for me.
But this did not detract from the stay at the hotel</p><br>Not A Good Experience<p>I went to Las Vegas with friends to celebrate the New Year. Apparently, I chose this hotel as it is not too far from the strip. The location is good however, the hotel needs to be maintained very well. The wall paper at the corridors were peeling off the wall that is not good for a hotel to see. I usually stayed at Holiday Inn Express Hotels in Europe and Middle East and never had a breakfast on a styro plates, cups and plastic fork and spoons. This was my first time to experience at this hotel. I think there is still more to refine on this property. There was one occasion that the door doesn't open after we took our breakfast and we were stocked outside waiting for them to fix it. The good thing is, the did an excellent service recovery for this inconvenience.</p><br>Not very impressed<p>We've stayed here many times, mainly b/c it's convenient. What a disappointment this time! First of all, no lounge chair in the room. You can only watch TV from bed. Next, every appliance in the room was unplugged -- microwave, fridge, lamps, clock. All the outlets are behind furniture, it seems. We should have called for the hotel engineer, but my husband shoved stuff around and did it himself. We had someone next door who couldn't sleep without the TV on at highest volume. I'm guessing he was afraid of the dark or something b/c it went off when the sun came up. Again, I should have called the desk. We paid $110 plus tax for this room, I'm sure a lot less than is possible in Vegas. Everything is clean, ordinary attractive. The beds are not very comfortable. I think I'll try the Fairfield next door on our next trip.</p><br>No surprises off the strip<p>I travelled to attend CES at the last minute. At the time I booked just before Christmas, there weren't many rooms available in conference hotels and I was trying to travel cheap. I knew I would have a car anyway, so I booked this hotel. It's on the other side of the interstate from the strip, across from the airport. The only buildings nearby are two (yes, two) Chevron stations. So don't expect to do too much walking around the hotel. There is lots of parking and access to the interstate and the south end of the strip is really easy.

Inside, the hotel had no surprises. The staff at both the front desk and the breakfast room were friendly and attentive. My room was clean and reasonably well appointed. The desk is small. It's more like a table. The counter in my (accessible) bathroom was very small but that might be the deign of the accessible room. The bed was comfortable enough and the room was quiet.

My only complaint..... I had to ask for a pouch of oatmeal on day one. I didn't see any out on day two. I should have asked again.

All around this hotel is good value if you have to be in Vegas but don't need the strip experience.</p><br>Very Nice hotel especially for the price<p>As a platinum member with Holiday Inn for years, this was one of the friendliest hotels I have stayed at. The welcome was sincere and welcoming. The rooms were nice, a little older but clean and fairly well maintained. The price I paid was exceptional and a definite value. I was in town for business and the hotel was convenient and I was able to get done what I needed. I would consider staying there again if I need an off the strip hotel.
Room Tip: No issue on which room to stay in. Any is good...
See more room tips</p><br>right of strip but a great deal<p>Fantastic customer service. The manager Nick was excellent and his staff is great! Check in was a breeze. Rooms so clean, quiet ,and comfortable. Breakfast was kept well stocked. Shuttle to strip quick and easy. Stay off the strip in a much more relaxing area,.</p><br>Good value "off strip" base<p>If you just want somewhere reasonably priced to sleep and shower this hotel fits the bill. We were on a road trip and this place was close to the airport with easy freeway access. The rooms were clean although heading towards needing refurbishment. Parking, wi-fi and breakfast were all included so it was excellent value. However if you want the glitz and glamour of the Strip it might not be for you.</p><br>Good location and price.<p>I got a good rate for this hotel and it was a nice stay. The room was a little "tired" but overall I was very pleased. I came to Vegas alone and I felt safe going to and from this hotel in the shuttle. The only downfall was that the shuttle only went to the far south and of the strip, it would have been nice if they would have had one twice a day, or something, to the North end and there is no restaurant . Free parking, no resort fees, free shuttle, and continental breakfast made this hotel well worth it.</p><br>Nice night out in Vegas<p>I flew out to Vegas for a night since a friend was getting married. Reason for staying at this location is that I found a room on a Saturday night in October for around $60 after fees. No resort fees & free breakfast is a good way to save some cash from the standard casino/hotels. The shuttle hours were listed on a sheet in the room however I never used it. I woke up around 6:30am and hit up the breakfast buffet shortly after it opened. I enjoyed the food, the only thing I didn't care much for was the cinnamon roll.

My hotel choices are mainly based on value and Holiday Inn Express was the best that I found during my stay. I would stay here again if I was in town and found another good deal.</p><br>Stayed here to see a concert elsewhere<p>Selected this hotel due to location relative to The Strip and The Orleans. Always a good experience at the Holiday Inn Express (updated rooms) and was not disappointed. If you have a car and don't mind driving a little, this is a very nice place to stay.</p><br></body></html>
