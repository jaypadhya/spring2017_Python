<html><head><h3>Holiday Inn Express Las Vegas South Hotel Reviews Page 18</h3></head><body><br>Perfect location between the airport and the strip.<p>I was just passing through Las Vegas on my way to photograph The Valley of Fire state park and chose the Holiday Inn to stay at for their decent rooms and I have to admit the free internet so I could check the local weather conditions for the next day. The hotel offers a shuttle service until midnight, however it is located close enough that I was able to drive to the Mandalay Bay casino and from there visit both the Luxor and Excalibur. The hotel is situated close to the airport as well as any number of diners and other places to see on the nearby Las Vegas Boulevard. I think the only drawback was that I set my watch incorrectly and woke up just as breakfast service was closing.</p><br>Near Strip, good breakfast, quiet<p>Here, the pros outweighs the cons so it was a good value overall, recommended

Pros: near Strip, fairly quiet, has good breakfast, good service from staff, easy parking, free wifi, clean bath and room
Cons: a bit dated, small rooms</p><br>4 stars the best<p>the front desk, brain david,lisa,and janel was very kind and wonderful.i couldnt believe how wonderful this place was.this was a good location,and best for your money.thank every body for been so kind and nice keep up the good job</p><br>Great location, close enough to the action. Been back 4 times<p>This hotel is a great place to stay, even better if you have Priority points. Just to the side of Mandalay Bay and close to many food outlets and next to a gas station..The staff are helpul, the hotel is great, free wi fi, wonderful breakfast, shuttle bus. The rooms were spacious, beds large and comfy and a microwave ( well in ours anyway) Its so nice to be able to get to your room within 2 minutes of parking your car compared to the main strip hotels..If you stay here you will be surprised by the place and just how close it is to the strip.. As I have said we have stayed there 4 times, that says it all</p><br>Fantastic hotel for families<p>Let me begin the review with the welcome at the hotel. We reached the hotel late evening from the airport and were welcomed by Brian at the front Desk. Our names were displayed at the front desk board as GUESTS OF THE DAY and we were given a bag of goodies and an upgrade to a top floor 'strip facing' room. This was a great begining.

ROOM: A spacious room with a seating area, nice fragrance, did not look tired, crisp white bed linen. We were given a microwave and a refrigerator. I believe it is usually available on request.The rooms have a Wi-Fi free of cost. The lobby has a PC which gives free access to internet limited to 15 minutes per user.

BREAKFAST: Is served on the ground floor opposite the front desk and has a good spread of cereals, toast, boiled/scrambled eggs,bacon, juices, tea/coffee, toast, bagels ets. Good enough to start your day.The hotel does not have any restaurant serving lunch or dinner. Recommend eating the buffet at Ceasars and MGM Grand though.

LOCATION : Is a 5 minute drive to the strip, the hotel has a shuttle to MGM and Mandalay Bay every 30/60 minutes. The drivers are most helpful and informative. On request they can drop you at the Town Center a great place to spend an evening with kids. We did not rent a car and on the Strip itself you can hire taxis. The Hotel shuttle will also drop you to the Vegas airport but inform them in advance. This property is for families mainly who can enjoy the Strip during the day/evenings with the glitz and noise and come back to the tranquility of a good night's sleep in this hotel. If gambling is the main agenda then this place does not have a casino so it will not fit your needs.

LAUNDRY: There is a laundry room on the 2nd Floor, with coin operated washing machine and dryers. The front desk can give you the quarters for operating the machines and you could also buy the washing powder from them. $ 1 for a wash and $ 1 for drying. We liked this a lot sicne we were staying for 4 nights. Freshly washed clothes.!

PARKING: I believe is free, we did not have a car though.

SERVICE: EXEMPLARY, Brian at the Front Desk is AWESOME to say the least. Wish there were more like him in the industry.RECOMMEND THIS PROPERTY for every family</p><br>Pleasant surprise :)<p>My sister and I were in town for Clinton Anderson's Walkabout tour so we stayed at this motel three nights. Overall, we had a very good stay. It was in a great location; close enough to walk to the MGM Grand but not as congested as being on the strip. Easy access to the freeway, too. Our main focus whenever we stay at a motel/hotel is cleanliness. We were pleased that this establishment was very clean, in good condition, and did not reek of smoke like most places in Las Vegas. Our room had plenty of space and our beds were comfortable. The bathroom was very clean but our only complaint was that the showerhead was a bit harsh and hard to adjust. The breakfast wasn't bad; the coffee and OJ were standard motel-fare: weak and watered down but we enjoyed the hard boiled eggs and yummy cinnamon rolls. The workout room was adequate with plenty of clean hand towels. We would stay again.</p><br>Keep Moving...<p>An older Inn which has been upgraded to meet HIX standards. It qualifies but is wearing quickly, Close to the "Strip" with transportation. Rooms are crowded and halls are narrow. Breakfast area was dirty (more the guests' fault than the staff''s). Unless you want to be in Vegas, keep moving up the road.</p><br>Generic and serviceable, but about 15 years dated<p>Let's face it - choosing the Holiday Inn Express Las Vegas South is a pure rate/value play. Or perhaps a pure rate play. The hotel is often $10-20 less than its counterparts at the I-15/Russell Road exit, so it's a relative bargain at face value. However, once you get inside the hotel, you can easily see where corners are cut and capital expense hoarded to allow for that shaving of rate.

The lobby, entry, hallways and rooms are as if time had stopped around 1995 - dark green carpets, often worn and dirty; scuff marks along all walls and room doors; pillows that needed to be replaced a couple of years ago; worn linens and towels; a hulking tube-style TV sitting on top of a dresser. The hotel is simply tired.

So is the service. At check-in, I was greeted with a mass-copied "letter" stating that the HIE pool "is not currently heated" and that I was welcome to use any of the heated pools at the neighbors - the Staybridge Suites, Fairfield Inn and Courtyard share this plot of land. Upon entry to the room I got ready for bed, hunkered down, reached for the remote - and couldn't find it. I called down and was first told that I could come down and get a replacement, then reluctantly told that they would bring one up. 20 minutes later, I had to get dressed and trudge down to get a remote and was met with "Oh, sorry. Here."

There are a few bright spots, although none rise to the level of delight to make this a "high value" choice. Room AC units are as powerful and ice-cold as I've ever seen, especially in Las Vegas. The HIE breakfast is stocked well and kept clean for the entire length of the shift. Beds are comfortable and the room itself is clean with no major issues. Water pressure is fantastic and the HIE signature shower head pumps it out well.Blackout drapes do a better job of actually blacking out the room than in most hotels in this price range.

As long as I'm generally not bothered and they can clean the room, I can stay here for the 3 nights of my stay.

Next time, however, I'll consider other options. That's the danger of trying to manage a hotel at the edge of the value proposition - you'll slip over that edge and lose future guests and never know it. While I originally chose this option because it was $10-20 less than competitors, next time I'll remember the overall tired appearance and I'll try something else.</p><br>Quiet and excellent Hotel only 1 mile away from the strip<p>It was our last Hotel after 12 days of an Arizona roundtrip through the Navajo reservations and National Parks. We decided to stay here after reading the reviews here at Tripadvisor, looking for a Hotel that avoids the loud street Strip rumble, but were located only 5 minutes from the airport and casinos. The decision to stay here was absolutely right. We stayed in this Hotel for 2 days, May 6th and 7th.

Fast and easy check-in, front desk staff friendly, comfortable rooms, clean bathroom, high speed Wi-Fi, good TV, quiet (ask for a room in the third floor heading the opposite side of Russel Road) and a good breakfast in a comfortable lobby, makes this hotel a hidden Gem in Vegas.

There is also a free Casino Shuttle Bus every 30 minutes to Mandalay Bay and every 60 minutes to MGM Grand.

Great Hotel, fantastic location, good price.</p><br>Hidden gem in the city of sin!!!!!<p>We checked in to the Holiday Inn Express for one night as we opted to hit Las Vegas a day early. We then moved on to the Luxor where we had already prepaid for 3 nights, however in hindsight (and if you read my separate review on the Luxor) I wished we had stayed at the Holiday Inn Express for the 4 nights!

We were offered a good rate, despite only turning up around midday. Our room was clean and offered a view of The Strip, without the noise of hotel rooms on The Strip. Despite its proximity to the airport we had a fabulous night's sleep, and were not disturbed by the aircraft noise unlike the Luxor.

The breakfast was good, Holiday Inn Express do this well, and the bed oh so comfortable. The hotel offers guest laundry for around U$1 per wash and free internet access. Whilst others might not like the 15minute walk to The Strip, the hotel does offer a courtesy bus service to the Mandalay Bay every half hour from 0700 to midnight. We didn't use the service and enjoyed the walk instead but we saw the bus and drivers on several occasions and the service appeared to be excellent.

A good hotel to choose if you wish the joys of Las Vegas but without the noise.</p><br></body></html>
