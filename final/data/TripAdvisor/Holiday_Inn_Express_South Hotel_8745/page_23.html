Excellent choice for those wanting a casino free hotel. One small improvement would be the inclusion of an airport shuttle pick up given the pricing position of the rooms.</p><br>plane spotters dream<p>We found this hotel to be far noisier than staying on the strip! we stayed one night prior to flight back home and so wanted a quiet night. Planes were taking off almost overhead every 30 seconds or so till late at night and from early in the morning. Apart from the plane noise the air conditioning unit was very noisy and the walls are very thin.

good points-rooms clean and tidy,pool ok and free breakfast buffet.
There is a useful shuttle bus every half hour to and from the Mandalay Bay Hotel but too far from the strip if you want the "vegas experience"The hotel is in the middle of a developing business park close to the I15 on the other side of the strip. as for value for money can't complain at $70 per night but if wanting to get the best out of your stay pay more and stay on the strip</p><br>So near yet so Far...<p>Just returned from a fly drive to USA with my husband and 9 year old daughter- stayed in the Holiday Inn Express South Las Vegas for 3 nights. In my opinion it was absolutely perfect for our requirements. We had an executive twin Queen room which was much larger than average complete with microwave and full size fridge. The beds were so comfortable, although the air con unit was noisey. Location wise, it was just a five minute drive to the strip, where free parking is available at every hotel and also only ten minutes drive from the airport. It was great to be so near to the strip, but I was glad that we chose not to stay at the hotels there as they were loud, noisey and brash, just as you would imagen for a town called 'Sin City'. Breakfast was great with a good choice of cereals, yoghurt, friut, muffins, dainish pastries etc. Also it had a computer & printer in reception area to enable you to look up stuff on-line or check your email. Pool was great with towels available, usually had it to ourselves. All in all I would definately stay in this hotel again, especially it you are travelling with kids.</p><br>Just right!<p>This was the perfect Vegas hotel for us. With 2 children, aged 10 and 13 we did not want the full on, non-stop casino invasion of the main hotels on the Strip. The Holiday Inn Express was easily accessible, but yet away from the hustle and bustle. When we went into the pool we had it to ourselves! Not a slot machine in sight. The room was clean, comfortable and spacious, plenty of room for the 4 of us. We got the free shuttle to the Strip a couple of times but soon realised it was just as easy to drive to one of the hotel car parks on the Strip. The complimentary buffet style breakfast was great each morning with plenty of choice. We would definitely visit this hotel again.</p><br>Great Place off of the Strip<p>We recently stayed at this Hotel two separate times in a 10 day span. We were taking a motorcycle trip to California and the Grand Canyon and stayed here at the beginning of the trip and for two nights when our trip was competed. We were very impressed with the cleanliness of this Hotel. It had a great pool that was opened to midnight which was great as we returned from our bike ride later in the evening and this was a great way to cool off. Our room was very nice, we had a King sized bed, a table with a chair and another chair in the corner. Bathroom was a nice size as well. Would be nice if all rooms had fridges but you could obtain one on a first come first served basis for $10 per day. We didn't bother as we put ice in the sink to cool our drinks. Breakfast was very good, had lots to choose from and had a very nice area to sit in. The fireplace in the middle of the room was a great touch. We left our suitcases with management while away and they stored them for us, away from where others could get into them. This was very nice of them. The shuttle was nice to have and goes to the Mandalay Bay every half hour. We felt this could be made better if you were allowed to call for a shuttle when done on the strip as sometimes we had to wait more than a half hour for our return shuttle. We would defenitely stay here again and I think that once they expand the strip that way, which they look like they are doing right now, this will be a prime place to stay.</p><br>Well managed<p>A very warm welcome after a long trip from the UK. We were greeted with a smile and a choice of rooms. Everything was done to make us comfortable. The Air Conditioning was a little noisy but it had to work hard whilst we were there. Breakfasts were the usual motel style and of good quality. A maid was always on hand to replenish and tidy up. It was significant that the manager was frequently visible. This was unusual at other motels on this trip but she kept an eye on things and chased her front line staff when appropriate.
This motel might not be on the strip but there is a free shuttle provided twice an hour and, there is also a free shuttle to the airport and/or the car hire centre, to meet travellers' demands.
We would not hesitate to use this hotel again.</p><br>Great location<p>Our family stayed at this Hotel not having been to Las Vegas previously. The Hotel is 4 minutes from Mandalay Bay and is reached via the free shuttle running every 30 minutes until midnight. A taxi fare is approximately 8 USD.
The staff at the Hotel were amongst the best I have ever experienced in both attitude and service. Particulary Brian and Brett on the front desk and the two regular drivers another Brian and Pierre.
The free breakfast was basic but sufficent and free tea and coffee all day. There are additional vending machines for drinks and snacks. Note there is no restaurant at the Hotel but you can easily order food in.
The pool is not special but very nice and is often empty and feels like your own pool, plenty of clean towels provided.
On the strip if you need transport take the Deuce bus but if you are in a hurry you better just walk as it was so slow. Recommend you visit the half price ticket booths for shows saving a fortune. Sky diving was fantastic with Sin city and worth the money as is the Dolphin habitat at the Mirage.
Would definately recommend the Hotel and is close to the strip for the action but also far enough away for a rest. When we go back we will stay at this Hotel which is child friendly.</p><br>Excellent!!<p>This hotel proved to be the perfect stop over hotel for us in Vegas before we started our tour of Utah and Arizona. The rooms were spotlessly clean and extremely spacious. The beds and pillows, in particular, were very comfortable after our long haul flight from the UK. The breakfast was more than adequate with a good selection of cereals, bagels, pastries, etc. The staff were very helpful and friendly. We did not use the pool so I cannot comment. We would definately stay here again and I would recommend this to anyone who wants a good value hotel which is near too, but not located directly on the Strip.</p><br>Great Hotel/Great Value<p>The location is excellent. Internet is free. Don't expect to walk to anything as it isn't on the strip. But they do have a free shuttle to Mandalay Bay.

The rooms were clean. The maids very nice. This hotel is a good value at any price around 100 Dollars. Negotiate!

The pool was/is nice and uncrowded - The breakfast is good. I will use this property again.</p><br>Nice Clean Hotel<p>We arrived on July 29 for 3 nights. We found the hotel to be just what a hotel should be. Clean and comfortable. The staff were fantastic especially Brian, who supplied us with bottled water when the vending machine was empty and even baked cookies and supplied a cold glass of milk for our daughter one night! I have to say, that was above and beyond what we expected.

The rooms are spotless, as said in other reviews and I am really fussy. The walls are really thin though. I heard in detail (through the wall) from some guys in the next room, all about their "show" experience. I am glad that they didn't wake my daughter up! However, someone must have complained about the noise, as the staff were up quite promptly to sort out the problem.

The pool is quite and clean and there is a safe relaxed atmosphere there.

I see this as being a hotel for families with younger kids staying in Vegas and people on business. Our family would definitely stay again, but if my husband and I were in Vegas without our daughter, we would stay on the strip. The shuttle bus they put on there is great, but if we were there to gamble, I enjoy being able to easily walk back up to our room without the hassle of buses and taxies.

We all definitely give this place a big thumbs up!</p><br></body></html>
