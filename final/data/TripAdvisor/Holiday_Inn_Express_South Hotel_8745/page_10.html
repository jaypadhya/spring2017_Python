<html><head><h3>Holiday Inn Express Las Vegas South Hotel Reviews Page 10</h3></head><body><br>Good Hotel Some Problems<p>We arrived on July 3rd for the Independence Day weekend. We were very happy with the location close to Mandalay Bay and the strip. Since we had our vehicle with us and the temperatures were extreme the off strip location worked perfectly for us. My husband did use the complimentary shuttle to Mandalay Bay one morning and had no issues at all.

The front desk staff was great, no complaints there!

The room...While decently clean as all Holiday Inn Expresses tend to be, we did experience some issues. First, when we arrived, there was some kind of red substance on the toilet behind the seat. I thought it looked like blood, my husband thought it was makeup. The cleaning staff was in the hall, they said it was the solution they use to clean and took care of it right away. The second day of our stay here in Las Vegas, we left the room at 9am and did not return until after midnight. We immediately realized that no one had attended to our room that day. Bed was unmade and the towels were not changed out. We travel extensively (about 60 days a year), and have never had a room that was unattended for an entire day. It was too late by time we returned to have anyone come take care of it, but it was a pretty big oversight!

The room smelled fine and clean the first time we walked in but after several hours of being gone we came back to a room that smelled like someone had sat down and smoked in it. We thought this to be very odd especially since we are in room 223 over the conference room. When we came back the second day, we noticed the smell again mid-day. On the third and fourth nights we came in to the skunky smell of pot. Both are gross smells when you are a non-smoker, but we never figured out where the smells could be coming from! Maybe a smoking area back by the door which may be drafting in through the A/C or the employees are smoking in the conference room and it's coming up. Either way someone needs to fix the issue.

Overall, we would stay here again, even with all of minor inconveniences we experienced. The breakfast was good on the first two days when it wasn't as busy. Saturday morning was crazy and we wound up with only cinnamon rolls and coffee. The location is great, the bed is comfortable and the room is clean. Decor is decent although it feels very 1990s. It is updated much more than the lower end towers of some of the nicer strip hotels.
Room Tip: I would stay on the end opposite the pool and ask to be away from the backdoor entrance in the case...

Breakfast area is very large and food is good for a hotel chain. Parking is shared between several properties. Pool was broken but we could have gone to the other properties to use the pool. Would stay here again. Hope they can get the pool fixed!
Room Tip: Ask for a south facing room away from the road.

They are in an ideal location, just across the freeway bridge to the Luxor, right on the strip (and very close to the airport, if you need the shuttle). The rooms are always nice, especially for the price. There are lots of dives in Vegas where you can get a cheaper room, but usually there are other downsides - remote location, thin walls, smokey smelling rooms... but this one is always consistently good. I enjoy the breakfasts and liked the microwave and mini fridge in the room as well. I will continue to go there as I have for the last decade, several times a year.

On this last trip, I was a little last checking out because my rental car malfunctioned and I had to wait for roadside assistance. Through all of that, the staff was very supportive, helpful and patient with my situation.

(I rated less stars on the restaurant, as there is no restaurant, but there is food. I don't want to lead people to believe that the food is worthy of 4 star quality, it's just great for the price)</p><br>Location was nice thats about it<p>I came to the Holiday inn this past weekend .My fiance and I checked in about 12:30am due to a late flight, she introduced herself to the gentleman at the front desk who had a look on his face like he didn't want to deal with us. Once my fiance gave him her employee card for check in he looked up our reservation and saw that we wanted a smoking room. The guy then turned and looked at her and said" i am assuming you want a non smoking room even though you requested a smoking room?" Being tired from working earlier we didn't know if he was trying to be funny or be rude. We told him quickly no we want a smoking room. At this point we were beginning to get irritated because how he was acting and the other people waiting in line were making comments like "is he really talking like this too you". Once we got our key we go to the room and we find out its non smoking and its two queen beds. We clearly booked a smoking and a king room. My fiance immediately went back to the desk and had him change it even though he told us ALL THE ROOMS ARE FULL. But somehow we got a 4th floor king room smoking in the end. The Decor of the Hotel in my opinion was very very poor. The room didn't even have a mini fridge nor a microwave. Also too the tv sits on the table so if you lay down you won't be able to see the TV. The breakfast was ok. The pool was closed and we had to walk to another p I do wanna say the front desk asian woman was amazing and the assistant manager Robert I believe his name was apologized to my fiance and I, told us if we come back he will upgrade us to a suite. Sad to say I told my fiance WE WILL NEVER COME BACK!</p><br>Nice, convenient location<p>Booked a room through Hotwire. When we checked in, we were given a King, smoking room. We preferred to have 2Q, non smoking room but, it being a holiday weekend, that room type was unavailable. Nick arranged to have a machine placed in the room that would clean the air, which worked well and then the next day, Nick was able to move us to the room we wanted. Nick was willing to do anything he could to be helpful & accommodating. Rooms were clean and comfortable. The breakfast was well stocked. Would definitely stay here again!</p><br>Conveniently placed<p>The hotel is handily placed close to the airport. We were only staying for two nights en-route to a rafting tour of the Grand Canyon. We couldn't locate a shuttle bus at the airport so had to catch a cab, which wasn't very expensive. The hotel does have a shuttle to the airport but it runs to a fixed half-hourly schedule; easy to organise when going to the airport. They also have a shuttle to The Strip, dropping off at New York, New York. From there you can get the monorail to other places.
The hotel was standard fare but perfectly acceptable. The night porter was rather extrovert or else had been on something, but polite and he did the job. The hotel was also very happy to let us leave our bags there for ten days while we rafted, even though we weren't staying the night on our return.
One thing I was unhappy with was the disposable cups, plates and cutlery at breakfast, but this wasteful practice seems to be standard at US hotels. It's time they got some environmental awareness.</p><br>Great if you want some peace in Vegas.<p>Good Holiday Inn. Near major roadway so this is a travel dream for anyone passing through or going to the airport early. We did request first floor and it was not available but they have an elevator if needed. Just OK but adequate for a short stay. If you want the Vegas life stay somewhere more expensive or take a cab. This is a place for rest. Will stay here again when flying.</p><br>It's a Holiday Inn Express.<p>We stayed here March 7,8, 9 2013. In town for a volleyball tournament so hotel prices were high. $120 a night. We arrived from Southern Ca late and asked for a non smoking room. They said they didn't have any. We were placed in a smoking room but told we could move the next day. Mentioned fans and room spray for the room but it never came. Ironically we moved EARLY the next morning and obviously no one had stayed in the room the previous night. I guess they were waiting for the Queen of England or some poor soul who was going to pay $140 plus for a room. Once we moved in it was off to volleyball. The breakfast was fine, better than I eat at home. The beds were good. Room was clean. Bathroom towels were plentiful. Housekeeping was responsive.

Noise is a factor. We were on the top floor. Good thing but, and I am going to put this in the tips area too. DO NOT get a room that faces the street (front) on Monday- Thursday nights if you are a light sleeper. The amount of big rig traffic going down the street was incredible and they all downshift right at the light. Saturday was fine. Do bring ear plugs if you need. My family didn't notice it at all and slept just fine, I was not so lucky.

Staff was unobtrusive, breakfast workers were nice. Work out room has 3 pieces of equipment.

Shuttle runs on the half hours. We took the one to New York New York and then walked around on the strip and took it back so we didn't have to hassle with parking. Not super convenient but workable. The shuttles share with other nearby hotels that are very similar in style, offerings and cost so do compare prices if you want to be away from the casino hotels.
Room Tip: Monday through Thursday ask for a room away from the front, facing the back if you are a light sleep...

The company with which I interviewed set up the reservation as it is a hotel they regularly use. The hotel is very nice and the staff is excellent. A hot breakfast is included and it was really good. The hotel offers a shuttle to the Las Vegas strip, to Mandalay Bay and also to New York New York. I used the shuttle and it was right on time. No problem. Only two very minor drawbacks. I could hear people in the next room, Secondly, the shuttle to the airport does not run 24 hours a day, so I had to take a cab for my 0600 flight for $23. I recommend this hotel.</p><br>Worst front desk staff we've ever experienced<p>We've actually stayed at this hotel on 2 previous visits and had nice stays which is why we came back, however our most recent stay(April 26th and 27th) was exceptiionally bad. We arrived early on Friday at about noon and Justin was working the front desk. We did not request to check-in early, but we did request a top-floor room as we did when we made our reservation. Foot traffic noise in this hotel is exceptionally bad. Every person's footstep sounds like a loud bass drum, so if you're a light sleeper, you need to be on the top floor or you're going to have a long, miserable night. So when we politely asked Jason about a room on the top floor, he said, "Sure, I can get you one of those" He wrote down our names on a scrap sheet of paper and told us he'd call us when the room was ready. By 3:30pm we had not received a call so we decided to head back to the hotel since we were near the area. When we tried to check-in with Justin, he said, "Okay, I've got you in a room on the 2nd floor." We asked why he put us there when we specifically requested the top floor from him only 3.5 hours ago. He said, "Sorry, I'll put you back on the waiting list". So we had to continue to wait. When we came back about 6pm, a different person was working the front desk. She said, "Sorry we won't have any more rooms on the top floor tonight. I don't know what Justin told you, but they're simply not available now". So they basically gave those rooms to someone else. Here's where it gets really bad. This woman apologized for the situation and said, "Here, I'm going to block off a top-floor room for you tomorrow night so you'll be guaranteed a top-floor room tomorrow." We said "thank you" and managed to sleep on and off despite the fact that she placed in a room that bordered the stairwell and we got to hear people running up and down the stairs all night, and we got to stand in 5 inches of water in the shower since it didn't drain properly. Now, the next day, we try to check-in early and Justin says, "Your room should be available in a few minutes". So we waited there at the hotel for 90 minutes just to watch Justin walk out the door for the day and the new woman(same woman as day before) promptly tell us that there won't be any rooms available for another 2 hours. I verified with her that she still had that room blocked off for us and she said "yes". So we headed out and when we later returned that evening to our "guaranteed" top-floor room, and the new guy at the front desk says, "Sorry, I see that she blocked off a top-floor room for you, but for some 'unknown' reason, I don't have one for you". Someone at the front desk that afternoon/evening basically unblocked it and gave it to someone else. So the front desk staff there basically lies to your face, kicks the ball down the rood and points their finger at the previous shift, and steals rooms from each other, Also, despite leaving a tip for housekeeping on our first night's stay, they decided to keep my iPhone charger instead of turning it in to the front desk. So they're a pack of thieves who steal even when you are nice enough to leave a tip. Overall, a horrible stay at this Holiday Express which is unfortunate because we've had 2 nice stays in the past which led us to stay again on our recent trip. We will absolutely never be back.
Room Tip: You have to be on the top-floor or else you'll be listening to very very very loud foot traffic...
