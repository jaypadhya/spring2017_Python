<html><head><h3>Holiday Inn Express Las Vegas South Hotel Reviews Page 13</h3></head><body><br>Just for the Pool<p>So we just came from 2 other holiday inn for Labor day weekend, and those were great and ok. When I went in to check in, just say the front desk girl is arguing with 3 other people. After the little 1 minute show, I got my check in. I DID NOT received the my PC welcome like the other 2 place did, the front desk girl did not want to talk to me, and a bit rude. Here is the best part, She PUT US IN A ROOM IN FRONT OF PUBLIC RESTROOM. I went back to ask if we can get a different room, She said nope, we're all BOOKED. This hotel should not have holiday Inn name on it at all. Only Reason I give 2 star was because the shuttle service, and they got a pool.

PS: The room had some smell..........., Pancake machine broken, Only other thing nice, is the guy in charge the next morning.</p><br>Dingy rooms, outdated furniture and worn out carpet - enough said!<p>We stayed one(1) night at the Holiday Inn Express(5760 Polaris Ave) in Las Vegas and needless to say this will be the last stay at this hotel ever.
The rooms were dingy, there wasn't sufficient lightning in the rooms or hallway, found few bugs in our room and most of all the carpets looked dirty and the general decor was just poor.

For the price we paid, we were expecting much, much better rooms. The hotel is far away from the Strip and you'll need to take a cab or the hotel shuttle.

Overall, unless you can't find a room in Vegas, stay here otherwise, you have better alternatives.
Room Tip: Stay in the upper floors - this will keep the crawling bugs away.

Staff was nice and would stay at in the future. Breakfast decent, as it had the typical Holiday Inn Express items, but they were a tad cold. Since I got to the eating area later in the morning, I was not counting on hot food or anything left, but was pleasantly suprised, so not complaining!</p><br>Great place to stay<p>We stayed one night at this hotel on August 7. It is a great place to stay. The breakfast is wonderful. The rooms are very nice and the hotel was extremely clean. There are only 2 reasons I do not give it 5 stars. The first is that there was a fairly good amount of leafy debris in the pool along with numerous bugs which made swimming very unpleasant. The other reason is that they told us that they provide free shuttle service to the Mandelay Bay hotel. We had gone out to dinner and decided to come back to the hotel and take advantage of the free shuttle service rather than drive ourselves. Unfortunately they do not tell you that you are going to be dropped off at the Mandelay Bay Convention Center which is quite a long walk over to the casino area...approximately 10-15 minute walk through the convention center and then through the hotel which are connected. This would not have been a problem for us but we had other family members with us one of whom was unable to walk long distances. They were not able to walk that far and actually had to turn back and then wait for the next shuttle to take them back to the hotel. Had we known we were going to be dropped off so far away from the casino area we would have driven ourselves there and valet parked. Other than those two things this is an excellent hotel and very close to the airport. I highly recommend it if you do not care about the pool and do not plan to use the free shuttle to get to the Mandelay.</p><br>What a good night sleep!!!<p>The first hotel I had in many years that the room did not smell cigarette smoke. I have a very bad reaction to cigarette smoke such as nose bleed, therefore, I have to make sure that the room is truly non-smoking not the one being sprayed on to get rid of the smell or smoke. I have been to different hotels from 3,4,5 and 5 and a half stars hotels. Most of them even the 5 stars caused me severe nose bleeds. I had stayed in Holiday inn before and was not happy in terms of smoke smell in the room. But this time, after a long drive, unexpectedly decided to rest in Las Vegas for a night. We had called several good hotels in the area but none that can accommodate 5 people in one room except this Holiday Inn. Wow..to my surprise as soon as I walked in the room, it feels and smells like my own room at home. First time in a very long time woke up in a hotel room with no nose bleed. Instead a feeling of freshness and energized ready to tackle my day...Thank you Holiday inn. Oh...they also have complimentary breakfast including eggs and bacon...I would pay more for this room next time.</p><br>Quick stay<p>We had a family emergency and needed a hotel in Vegas at 3AM. Front desk was able to get us a room. I usually stay at HI express and this one was much like the other ones. I did get a platnum upgrade and the room was nice. Hotel could use a better cleaning in my opinion but it was more than fine for our short stay. Staff was excellent and location off the strip is nice. Wife is unable to wak the long dstances that the big casinos demand so this was a nice alternative. Parking was a breeze and getting in and out of the hotel parking lot was pretty easy. Location is very convienent. Air conditioner worked great but was noisy as heck, might be time for the hotel to upgrade to some newer quieter units. But it worked well and that is what really matters in Vegas.
Room Tip: If view matters to you get a view towards the front of the hotel, the back view is deadly boring.

Room Tip: Save money and eat the free breakfast...very good
See more room tips</p><br>Pretty good<p>I have stayed at many Holiday Inn Expresses throughout the country and this hotel charges for things that are standard in most other locations. Charging $15 per night for microwaves or mini fridges seems a bit pricey. I felt like just because we were in Vegas they felt it was ok to nickel and dime people to death. Usually the breakfast menu rotates a bit, but throughout the entire week we stayed it was exactly the same. The pool was pretty dirty and didn't really smell like it had chlorine in it, but in their defense someone came in the pool area to work on it while we were there.

That being said, the staff is very friendly. It's a very convenient location off the strip. We had a great view of the strip from out room. It was great to look out the window and see all the lights. The laundry room was conveniently located on our floor and I was impressed with how well the dryers worked. Usually, the clothes aren't completely dried. I also liked the flyers that the restaurants had put under our door all week. It was nice to see food delivery choices. Many of them we tried and they were wonderful. The bathrooms throughout the property were all very clean and well taken care of.
Room Tip: The A/C works VERY well. It's helpful to keep the fan running to circulate the air instead of m...

You're near IHOP and In-N-Out if you want to get quick food without going on the strip. The front desk staff was very friendly and the continental breakfast was pretty good but you need to get there very early if you expect to get anything. Another pro for me is that I didn't have to deal with the smoke that is prevalent in the casinos. I could actually breathe! The only thing that wasn't great for me was the pool area. For those of us that take summer vacations with our families, the pool pretty much takes center stage. This is not something that is unique to this particular hotel but something I wish all hotels would take notice of and that's either having someone stationed permanently or at least someone coming out to check the rowdiness that sometimes happens at pools. For those of us with families, we don't want to have to play cop on those that are disrespectful with language and attitude around our children. It goes the other way too that families should keep a watch on rowdy children. Overall, this is a great place to stay with the family while being minutes away from the strip. I highly recommend!</p><br>Very good property and rooms. Off strip but convenient.<p>I stayed here for 5 nights and it was pretty comfortable hotel. The rooms are good as per the HIE standards and the breakfast was good too. Its a little bit (10mins) off the strip but they provide regular shuttle service to the strip which is pretty convenient too. Only problem is its only available till 1AM and who comes back to hotel in Vegas before that anyway :) Overall a good hotel, good staff and a nice comfortable stay !!
Room Tip: Take the rooms with the strip view
