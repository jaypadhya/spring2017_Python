<html><head><h3>Holiday Inn Express Las Vegas South Hotel Reviews Page 27</h3></head><body><br>Clean 'Near Strip' Alternative<p>Holiday Inn Express, Russell Road at Polaris Avenue, Las Vegas. Relatively new, clean, non-casino property. Rooms were very comfortable- with the "new" HI Express bedding and linens. Breakfast was more than adequate- juices, eggs, muffins,cereal,biscuits & gravy, fruit, yogurt, etc. A hotel shuttle will transport you to/from Mandalay Bay. You're within eyeshot of many of the south strip casinos. Convenient to McCarren Airport via freeway- take "airport tunnel" to I-15North, then exit left at Russell Road. There are two all night convenience stores / gas stations a few steps away, as well as a Colonial Bank ATM. We discovered the studio/warehouse for Magician David Coppefield across the street-you'll see the many touring trailers parked. Not much else in walking distance of this hotel complex, except a "Gentlemen's Club." The pool and jacuzzi were sparkling clean, with nice nighttime views of the Strip lights. Oh, if you really wanted to walk to Mandalay Bay- you could probably make it in appx 25-30 minutes on a pedestrian sidewalk, but you'll have to cross a freeway entrance and exit. Complimentary computer kiosk/printer just off lobby.</p><br>Perfect<p>After spending 2 nights on the Strip, we needed a cheaper hotel to spend our last night before our flight home. Having read the reviews on Trip Advisor I went ahead and booked a room for my family - 2 adults & 2 teenagers. Very spacious, modern, clean and well equiped room. Complimentary continental breakfast, internet access and shuttle to the strip. The staff were very friendly and helpful, offering local info - even though we were only there for one night. The kids loved the pool and hot tub - again this area was spotlessly clean and tidy - nice shower area and toilet facilities. The only drawback was construction in the area - much like the rest of Vegas at the moment!! - but this didn't cause us any problems. I would highly recommend this hotel - if you aren't bothered about staying on the Strip (having done so for the first 2 nights - it's not all it is cracked up to be) - this hotel is perfect - the complementary shuttle service gets you to the strip - about 5 mins drive away. You can then hop on the deuce bus at $5 for the day - you can just hop on and off where and when ever you chose - This hotel was also 10 mins from the airport - but plane noise was not a problem.</p><br>Good location, good front desk butpoor housekeeping.<p>Let's start saying that this hotel, even if not directly on the strip, has an optimal location. If you can move with your own (or rented) car, the strip is 5 minutes far.
The swimming pool is good and not very busy.
The breakfast is almost the same you can find in any other holiday express hotel.
Talking about bad things, we've been very unlucky with housekeeping service: during our four days stay we found our room undone after 2.00pm for three consecutive days.
The last day, our room was still undone at 3.40pm!
Said that, we found our rooms always very clean.
Overall, the front desk service is good, but housekeeping organization needs strong improvements.</p><br>Good alternative to strip<p>Stayed here for one night in August. Nice, clean room with new bed linens and showerhead. This is a good alternative to staying on the strip. Less expensive and easy to drive to any casino on strip. All the casinos have free self parking so you can leave your car and walk up and down the strip then drive back to hotel when done. Free wireless internet and continental breakfast are plusses. Only negative was loud group in hallway in middle of night, but it is Las Vegas so I guess you have to expect that. 5 minute drive to airport. They have a shuttle to Mandalay Bay but we had car so did not use that. No restaurants within walking distance(at least none that I could see).</p><br>G8t Hotel, good value<p>I stayed here with my wife and 2 kids 17 & 11 - we had a 2 bed room and it was fantastic - very clean - large and very comfortable. Swimming pool was also very handy and clean, also not very busy. We got the free bus from hotel to the Mandalay which ran every 30 min. we stayed all day - night at the strip with loads to do and got a taxi back which costs about $10. We then sat at the hot tum to bathe our feet. Go stay there it really was very good! Oh! breakfast was also super! continetal style</p><br>Hotel great-Unfortunately service poor<p>First off, our reservation information was not readily retrieved from the front desk person. When things were finally sorted out (we thought) we checked into our room, which turned out to be a smoking room (we wanted NON) that totally stunk....as did the entire floor! Because we had a show to get to quickly, we couldn't do much other than call the front desk and ask what happened to the non-smoking room we reserved. Basically the question was met with a disinterested comment about the room not being available, and would we like the room to be "sprayed again".
On a positive note, the beds and bedding in the rooms are very nice, and the breakfast bar and staff running it were top knotch.
Back to the bad stuff.....the following day I complained to a new front desk person about how bad the room smelled and interestingly she was able to move us. It was a bit of an inconvienience, but the new room was much fresher. We had a big bag of dirty laundry to do that day, so I figured I would put a load in and then watch the kids at the pool.....after bringing the bag to the laundry room, I noticed that there wasnt supplies available...so went to the front desk. They apparently ran out of guest laundry supplies....I was told there was a store nearby to get what I needed if I wanted. Needless to say, I wasn't impressed. The next day, I called the front desk to see if they had obtained any laundry supplies yet....I was told "yes" and that someone would run it up to our room. Well, after a half hour of waiting, I called the front desk and got a different guy who said there were NO supplies after all!
The other downside of this hotel was the location, and the limited shuttle service to the strip (only drop off and pick up is at Mandalay Bay). I guess if you don't want to spend much time on the strip, then location isn't much of a factor.
The bottom line for us is the poor service we received....primarily from the front desk staff. For that reason alone, we likely would not return to this hotel.</p><br>Great family holiday<p>We stayed here for four nights on a trip to the USA, we are used to staying in five star accommodation and only stayed here after such great reccommendations on Trip Finder and we were not disappointed! The hotel is clean, quiet and comfortable and our family room comfortably accomidated our family of six! The staff were friendly and helpful and staying off strip was a great decision. We had a ball in Las Vegas and will stay here again in a heartbeat!</p><br>Always Very Nice<p>We love this hotel. It is always extremely clean and fairly quiet, if you can deal with the sound of airplanes nearby (which is blocked pretty well when the air conditioner runs). The bathroom is large, with a massive granite counter inside and a hot shower with excellent pressure. The breakfast selection is great and convenient, as in the computer in the lobby with internet access. The shuttle is hit or miss and they're working on that problem by having it now only drop off and pick up at the Mandalay Bay. They also have brand new linens with a top sheet-covered down comforter and a choice of either soft or firm pillows on every bed. We'll stay again!</p><br>Great Hotel for the entire family!<p>This may be considered a "budget" hotel but we were treated like royalty.
Their beds were AMAZING!! Apparently it's their new line of beds, linens, soaps, shampoos...whatever it was it was GREAT! We came from a dump of a hotel the night previous and this was such a refreshing change.
I'm not kidding, we have a nice bed at home but I would trade mine at home for the bed in this hotel. I could have spent the entire vacation there.
The hotel was super clean, breakfast was great. They even gave us hot out of the oven cookies that evening.
The pool was nice and definitely needed in the Nevada heat!
AND...they have a free shuttle to Mandalay Bay to the tram until 11:00pm each night.
I would stay there again and again!!</p><br>Top Value; don't bother staying on the strip!<p>Just back from two weeks in California, driving from San Fran to Las Vegas and back. Most nights we stayed in Holiday Inns or Express because we had reward points. It was interesting to see how they varied when on the face of it they are the same. This one was best of the bunch; the fresh clean smell in the corridors made a good impression before we even saw the room. Warm cinnamon rolls for breakfast was a nice touch not found elsewhere.

The pool was the best of all the places we stayed and the rooms were quiet. The only minor problem was aircraft noise; it's right under the glide path. We were surprised that the windows were not double glazed; the London Heathrow equivalent felt like they were landng on the roof but there was no sound of them inside. The airport seems to close around midnight and open at 7.00ish so it didn't disrupt our sleep.

Beware of the free shuttle to the strip! We thought we'd take a break from the driving but jt arrived 10 minutes late and already full. The driver claimed there would be another along in 15 minutes so we sat down outside, only to find a few minutes later a queue outside of at least a shuttle full. It still hadn't arrived to pick them up when we left in the car 25 minutes later.

Parking is free in all the big hotels, so once you've worked out how to get outside onto the strip you've got it made. It's about 10 minutes drive to the Paris which was the easiest to park and exit.</p><br></body></html>
