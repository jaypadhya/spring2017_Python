<html><head><h3>Aruba Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 3</h3></head><body><br>Do your research<p>Normally, we read reviews but didn't in this case and chose to stay here because a trusted music event had held their annual festival here a few months ago and after looking at the website thought it looked like a decent place. Big mistake! I would not recommend this place to anyone. By looking at the photos on their professional website, we had the impression that it was a cool old school hotel that had been refurbished with a nod to their historic past. Sadly, the place is just old and rundown. It seemed that everything that could go wrong with the room did. We actually had to switch rooms twice and even had to buy our own sheets and pillows at Target since theirs were unacceptable (hair and stains), they didn't have any extras (all sheets and blankets were being cleaned). The towels had stains, everything in the room had the general feel of squalor. Thank goodness we had our own car and could escape to buy these necessities. The pool was cloudy, so didn't use. We were stuck staying here because all rooms seemed to be sold out in other hotels or cost 400+ and didn't care to spend that much. We relearned a valuable lesson- research, research, research. On a side note, the general staff was fine but management should be ashamed to run a place with such blaring issues.</p><br>Whoop! Whoop! When can we go back??<p>We were heading to Vegas on a business trip, then decided to make it a longer stay and have some fun. We picked the Aruba because it has a pool, restaurant and lounge on the property. (We were on vacation after all!) AND... The price was certainly well within our budget!!
Once we navigated the airport(!) We had no problem getting to the hotel- we actually took a limo- THAT was fun, and probably an unusual sight to pull up to the Aruba in a limo!
The check -in staff was very friendly and helpful.
The first elevator we came to didn't work, ugh! Our room was on the third floor! Whew! The second elevator worked and was much closer to our room.
I was VERY skeptical what to expect of the room after reading many of the reviews, but I was delighted! Beautiful area rugs on the tile floors, and I think tile is much more sanitary than carpets anyway! The bedding and curtains were lovely. It's obviously an older building, and things are kinds run down, but what the heck, we are there for the town, not the room.
Our next stop was the lounge-
WOW! Amazing history in there! The old photos are wonderful, you can FEEL the history and excitement! The bartenders are outstanding!! AND... it's happy hour from 6am-6pm!!! That's a LOT of sweet happiness in a cup! :)
We proceeded on to our next adventure on the property-
The Pool.
WOW! FUN!! We had a blast! Being from Washington State, we were overjoyed to be in the sun and the heat and had a hoot in this big beautiful pool!
After swimming and cleaning up, we next tried the restaurant on the property. Now, I am not saying that everyone's experience will be the same here, but... We found the restaurant, Esteffany's, I believe it is called, to be an enormous let-down. They did not have the first items we ordered off the menu. Our food took an hour to get to the table (and we were the only people in there) and the food when it did arrive, well. Let's just say I have never had instant mashed potatoes served with chicken Parmesan before, nor do I ever hope to again. One really GREAT thing about the restaurant- The VEGETABLES were HEAVENLY! Zucchini and carrots....... yummmmmm... wish I had some of those now!!
We stayed there 5 nights and 6 days and yes, we will go back. It is great to be off the beaten path, away from the crowds, within walking distance to anything we need, and any further- Hop on the Deuce! Wow, the double decker bus- ride once for $2 or pay $5 and get a 24 hour pass to ride as often as you like. It takes you from the crazy "strip" up to the Best area- FREEMONT! Wow, go there! The Aruba is in the middle of it all, away from them, but close enough. We spent one entire day just hanging around the neighborhood, and we did not see hookers, beggers, etc. Just a lot of newly wedded couples! :)
The very best part of the Aruba experience was the people- They ALL were wonderful to us and made the trip more fun.

Yes, you can stay in the glitzy, costly hotels, but you are more likely to get robbed, snubbed, spend all your money, overwhelmed, and not experience the history you get being in the Old Thunderbird.

We love this place, and we will be back!!</p><br>Use common sense and Aruba makes sense.<p>Just returned from Las Vegas and yes, I did stay at The Aruba. Reason being, the usual places I book were either sold out on one or more nights of my stay, or were off the charts pricewise due to conventions and spring break. After reading some other reviews of this place I have to say ... use some common sense when evaluating this place. Before taxes the average nightly rate was 34.00. That should tell you something. Also, realize that this location is north of the Stratosphere along Las Vegas Blvd in an older section of the strip that .... imagine this ... is somewhat of a seedy neighborhood. The building is old, the exterior paint color is horrible, the parking lot needs much better lighting at night and is in need of repaving. However, the actual rooms sit back off the strip about 60 to 75 yards, my room was spacious, clean and very average. The bathroom looked like it had been remodelled in the last year or two. Basic tv, basic phone, older drapes ... all for 34.00 a night. The staff was great, and one night the night clerk actually walked me to the room as it was very late.
This isn't Caesars, it's not even Motel 6, but in a pinch all things considered it was more than adequate for one guy for one week on business. Not a family, not a couple, one guy. If one uses common sense you'll be fine here. Restaurant there is ok, just ok, but for the last time ... 34.00 a night this will certainly meet SOME people's needs.</p><br>Not too bad<p>This hotel wasn't quite as bad as some of the reviews on here. It's kinda ghetto, and a lot of the cab drivers don't know where it's at, but for the price you really can't beat it. The room was a little dusty and the walls were thin, but for the most part it was clean. The emplyees are really friendly. On our last day there we had been up all night gambling, and they let us have the room until 3:00 so we could take a nap before our flight home. The Thunderbird lounge is really cool too, there is a lot of history there. They will give you free drinks if you are gambling on the machines at the bar.

Overall, the only negative is the location (about a $20 cab ride to the action of the larger hotels/casinos). A lot of the other reviews talk about hookers hanging out by the hotel. I did not see any. There is a strip club accross the street, but that's it. If you're looking for a simple, inexpensive place to stay, this is the place.</p><br>Hot Ghetto Mess!!!!! You Have Been Warned!!! <p>This hoe-TEL was the hottest mess I’ve ever seen….please do not confuse me for the illiterate as I do know how to spell. However, in this case, this was exactly what you’re thinking when I say “hoe” tel…I half expected louie the pimp to meet me in the parking lot to convince me of how $10 would get me $20!!! First of all, the pics on aruba’s website are photo-shopped!! That is not the front, back, side nor aerial view of the hotel itself…except for the avocado green….they forgetfully left out the pics of the vagabonds, strippers and addicts that greet you upon entry of the parking lot…the room well let’s just put it like this, you have a laminated warning sign notifying you of in the event of missing items what you will be charged starting with the T.V. for $300 on down to the face towel for $10.…the air? What air? We went in the hottest season and yet somehow they figured out how to have the individual cooling units fixed as the air never made it past the 1st bed by the front door… HOPEFULLY, the EDUCATED will get my SARCASIM as that is all you‘ll be left with once you‘ve booked and pull up to the hotel!!! And the travel website that I used did not try to accommodate me either….as a matter of fact, in the words of ’shante’ the manager, (WHO'S THE ONLY SHANTE IN THERE COMPANY BTW OR SO SHE SAID BECAUSE SHE REFUSED TO PROVIDE ME WITH A LAST NAME) it was my responsibility to know what I‘m booking and not take their word for it!!! I should‘ve known...when I had to call the company and hound them about not getting my email confirmation that that was a sign to cancel the reservation!!!</p><br>We were satisfied with the Aruba<p>Room was basic and functional. Beds were comfortable. We loved Liam, the bar tender. Breakfast is inexpensive and tasty but not available Monday and Tuesday. We easily flagged down taxis to take us to the strip and airport. It's funky and full of history. It is a bit away from the main part of the strip but only a $15 taxi ride (the traffic jams made the ride more expensive).</p><br>Very Misleading<p>We found this place online and the pictures online are VERY MISLEADING. do not stay here, Beds were sqeaky, Renovation not finished, very noisy, elevator closes on you, even the dining expierience was not good. Aruba Hotel & Spa, didnt see the spa anywhere . The only thing that was half way decient was the honeymoon suite.. Your better off staying at a Motel 6 or something, this Aruba is not a HOTEL at all.....</p><br>Deplorable conditions<p>Avoid the Aruba hotel. It was by far the worst hotel experience I've had. I can't properly describe everything that was bad about this place, but here's an attempt.

- There were knife holes in my dingy, musty smelling bedspread. I couldn't help but think that somebody had died in my bed.
- The entire room is tile floor. The tile is uneven, chipped, and rather rough. Definitely bring flipflops, not only because of the tile, but to keep your feet from touching the filthy ground and the slimy bathtub.
- The TV went out in the last few minutes of my universities conference championship b-ball game. The cable TV never worked again.
- I had my first introduction to bed bugs and was constantly itching and being bitten all night long.
- The tile and the thin walls make it VERY noisy. I could almost drown out the noise with the very loud air conditioner.
- The phone rang twice in the night but nobody was there when we picked up. Beyond that, a fire alarm somewhere in the hotel had bad batteries or something and beeped loudly every 5 minutes or so.
- The hair dryer burst into sparks when plugged in.
- Unless you want to explain to Little Johnny why the girls playing on the swingset in front of the strip club across the street are mostly naked, I'd recommend that you take your family elsewhere. It's located in a very seedy, non-friendly part of town - though it is at one far end of the strip.
- The place was generally filthy. The tile floors had not been mopped in some time and when swept, the dirt was just pushed under the beds. The closet and dresser were full of dust, garbage, and hair. The HUGE plastic plant that takes up a good portion of the room had not been dusted... ever.

I must say that the woman at the counter was extremely nice and helpful. Check-in was quick and easy. I caught the last few seconds of the game in the bar and it appeared to be a nice, classic place to hang out, though I doubt this to be true because I was the only person there that night.

In short, the Aruba is a very cheap place to stay if you can sleep through anything and are comfortable with deplorable living conditions.</p><br>GREAT place for the price!<p>Back when Las Vegas was for Rat Pack-esque sleazeballs, and I mean that in a loving way, good, clean cheap motels lined the strip, like someone had mushed Park Place with Baltic Avenue together on one street.

Those days are dead and gone, and Las Vegas suffers for it, frankly. The Aruba Hotel & Spa is one of the few throwbacks to that glorious era-- a clean, respectable, inexpensive motel in an city full of overblown overcharging casino-hotels. Sure, it's in an area where the main attractions are strip clubs and quickie marriage chapels, but frankly that's *precisely* the charm. Want klassy? Stay at the frickin' Bellagio. Do you want VEGAS, baby? Stay at the Aruba!

Mind you, the Aruba truly is a nice hotel in the middle of a very, ahem, non-touristy area. The staff is beyond excellent, the food is decent (and there is a great Cuban restaurant down the street), and the bartender has a PhD in nuclear physics. The bar, The Thunderbird, one of the few original Vegas places left. There is a great sense of history in this place, and they have pictures of their past glory days. If the idea of seeing one of the places Keely, Louis and Sam performed makes you misty, then stay here. You really have no other choice anymore (RIP, Glass Pool Inn, Tam O'Shanter, La Concha...)</p><br>Great Value for the Price!!<p>For 3 nights at less than $275, I was pleasantly surprised. Hotel was clean, food was decent, service was good. Would definitely stay there again. Easy access to airport, bus, and the strip. If you are looking to do Vegas on a budget, this is the place.</p><br></body></html>
