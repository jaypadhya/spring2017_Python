I really wish I would have invested more and stayed in a hotel closer to the strip. If you choose to walk, it's definitely at least a half-hour hike! The hotel itself was clean BUT the area where it is located (between Strip and Downtown) was terrible! It is opposite all sorts of stripjoints with very seedy characters hanging around - I did not feel safe.
The hotel is very simple and the rooms are a bit worn out and in the night you can hear everything from outside.
A tip: Invest in a taxi from the airport instead of taking the shuttlebus. This will save you loads of time as Aruba is one of the last hotels on the shuttle-round. However, most taxidrivers had no clue where the hotel was when they asked where I was staying.
Afterwards I can only say: Had I only spent more money on a nice hotel closer to the Strip....but you get what you pay for and Aruba is cheap. I did manage to have a great time though :-)</p><br>Not a good choice<p>We stayed at the Aruba Las Vegas Saturday night, March 11, 2006. The floors were tiled, comforter and curtains looked new and there was a coffee pot. The walls are very thin, sounded like furniture being moved in the room above us and loud talking, music and doors closing loudly around us. The heat did not work. The front desk sent a very nice security man to look at it (this was about 11:30 p.m.)and offered to move us to another room which we declined due to the late hour. He returned with extra blankets. A tan chair in the room and artificial plants were very dirty and the kitchen we had to walk thru to the bathroom was perhaps in the process of being removed or renovated (I hope) as it was certainly not useable - oven and stovetop dirty and with controls removed, sink covered with a board. It is in a seedy part of town. Because it was the only room our travel agent could find we were quoted $119 and paid about $135 with taxes. I would not stay there again.</p><br>Horrible Beyond Comprehension<p>This was the worst hotel experience that I have ever had in Vegas or anywhere else. I was deceived into believing that it was a nice HOTEL (not a motel) based on the description and the pictures, but believe me, it was not! The light fixtures needed bulbs, and there was no heat available in the room. I felt completely unsafe as we had to walk down a poorly lit alley and parking lot to our third floor rooms. One of the two elevators was also non-operational. The most frustrating part was the fact that even the Las Vegas cabbies did not recognize the name or location of the hotel, so it was very difficult, almost impossible to get a cab to pick us up. As a result we missed our morning flight after calling THREE cab companies to no avail. There was a dancing and loud music in the dance area that lasted until 5 in the morning. When we awoke to leave at 6 a.m., there was a man sleeping or unconcious on the roof of his car. Be warned travelers - STAY AWAY FROM THE ARUBA MOTEL!</p><br>Good Value but Marginal Location<p>Four of us stayed at the Aruba (formerly the Thunderbird) on a Saturday night in January when other hotels were just too pricey or unavailable because of conventions under way. We paid $70 for each room and the hotel was completely full.

On the plus side, the rooms were clean, the tile floor there was nice, and the person on duty in the lobby (Rosie) was warm and helpful. In fact, she greeted me by name, saying that I was the last person to check in that day. We did not eat in the lounge or dining room but they looked OK from a distance. Christmas decorations were still up and the decor was definitely in the kitsch category.

The negatives included certain things about the rooms (a stained towel, only a hand-held shower, a TV remote that didn't work) but the main downside was the location. As many have noted, the Aruba is in a somewhat seedy part of town with adult businesses near it. The parking lot was well lit but cars parked there had music blaring late at night and shady-looking characters were lounging about. In my opinion, people should not leave anything valuable in a car.

Other glitches: the elevator door closed so quickly that we were pinned by it and the walls were so thin that late-night arguments could be easily heard. However, the Aruba gave good value for money paid and I think that anyone who isn't unduly nervous and fearful would find it satisfactory. I personally would stay there again if other hotels were full.</p><br>Above average for the price<p>I booked into the Aruba because I was in Vegas for New Year's eve and room availability was so low everywhere else. This hotel is more in the style of a motel, but I was pleasantly surprised at its quality. When we arrived, the member of staff at reception couldn't have been more friendly or helpful - he advised us on the best way to get round Vegas and on which roads would be closed to traffic for New Year's. The room was a good size - obviously recently refurbished. Breakfast is not included but I had a delicious, well-priced breakfast in the hotel. The hotel is about a 10 - 15 minute walk to the first of the big casinos, but there is also a bus stop right outside the hotel which can take you all the way down the strip. If you are looking to save money on accommodation in Vegas then I would recommend it.</p><br>Try somewhere else<p>When we first arrived, it didn't look that bad. The room seemed ok but the bathroom door wouldn't close and the bed wasn't sturdy. The cable wasn't that great and we asked for extra towels and never got them. Also, there was some club event they were hosting and we got back to the hotel at 3am and it was still going on and could not find parking. There were drunk people every where and it was really loud. We decided to come back later and finally found parking. I wouldn't come back.</p><br>Wish I had stayed on a different night<p>We stayed on the wrong night. This area of the Strip, now referred to as the Art District, has an evening promotion the first Friday of every month. The Aruba hosts an after hours party in their restaurant. We got in around 10:00 pm. There was hardly any parking to speak of, as it was being used by party patrons, not hotel patrons. There were some drugs beings used in plain sight. When we initially checked in, we were given a room directly above the event. We went back to the front desk and were moved to the back of the hotel. The rooms were both clean and functional. The room and linens didn't smell. However, the walls are very thin. We heard most of the loud discussions throughtout the night from our neighbors. Also, the hotel plays music out by the pool. This wasn't turned off until after midnight and was back on again by 8:00 am. We would have liked to have gone back out, but were now concerned that we wouldn't be able to find parking when we got back. We were told the party would probably go until 5:00 am. Even though they are trying to improve this area, it isn't one that we felt comfortable walking in that time of night. Perhaps if we had stayed on a different night, our opinion would be a little different. The staff was very nice and tried to be accomodating. Based on this experience, I don't think we will be staying there again.</p><br>Cool retro with big changes<p>I JUST READ THE REVIEWS FROM 2003.....IT 'AIN'T THAT WAY ANYMORE!!

I think a new owner took over.

The entire hotel seems to have a had a large restoration and our room was very nice & clean. The Bar & Restaurant were good and drinks & food were reasonably priced.

It's back to the 'cool' Thunderbird days of the 1940's, 50's, & 60's.</p><br>Pleasant Surprise at the Aruba<p>Although we were sceptical after eading previous reviews, we were surprised how clean, quiet and spacious the rooms were for such budget accomadation. This was a last minute trip, and we didn't have much choice of inexpensive rooms.

Although it didn't have all of the "bells and whistles" of staying at a casino, the room was much nicer than the one I had at the Las Vegas Hilton on a previous visit. I would recommend the Aruba if you don't mind staying a few blocks north of the strip area.</p><br>Excellent<p>This hotel was very clean and it is under new management so the did a complete renovation of the hotel. Overall i had a good experience. The lounge is great.</p><br></body></html>
