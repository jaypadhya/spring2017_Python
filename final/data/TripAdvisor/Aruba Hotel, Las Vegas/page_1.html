<html><head><h3>Aruba Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 1</h3></head><body><br>This property should be condemned!<p>There is NO redeemable value for this dump. Staying at a homeless shelter has to be a more accommodating & a healthier experience. It's dark, dank and nasty, loaded with deferred maintenance. The tub, the sink, the furniture, the beds, the mattress, the linens, the towels ALL were below any standards known to mankind. If fact, there are no standards that meet with human living conditions here. Words cannot adequately describe the squalor condition of this location. The affordable pricing does not justify such pathetic and health hazard conditions. Consumer's beware, trust me, you do not want to stay here ever!! The accurate rating for this location is a negative 10 (negative ten).</p><br>The hell of hotels!!!<p>I stayed there for New Years, by far it was the worst experience.
First when we arrived they didn't had any record of my reservation, then the guy in the front desk didn't know what to do or how to check it (even though I had my reservation printed and a confirmation of the payment). He kept calling somebody to ask. At last, he gave me the room.
A room with no heater or a/c, the door didn't close well so you could open it by pushing. The bathroom had wind coming in that freeze you and the beds didn't had blankets.
Never stay there.
Ohhhh now I'm in a legal fight with the hotel, because three days later I found a charge of the hotel even though I had already paid and they charged even more. I mean it never stay there.</p><br>Dont stay here<p>Im so mad about everything first of all the pictures in there website are a scam, this place is terrible. The walls need work. Omg the was so discusting it looked like it was dirty but it was stained with who knows what? and had pieces of hair. The beds where not comfortable at all and I could feel the springs. The t.v. Didn't have a good cable connection, the wires where taped on And sparkled when I moved it cause I couldn't see a chanel. Never again I will stay here. >:( oh I will load pictures so you guys can see. Sorry if I misspelled something I'm writing this out of my phone.</p><br>TRAVELERS BE WARNED<p>I don't know how this place got a poor rating. IT WAS SOO MUCH WORSE THAN TERRIBLE!!!! I saw one positive rating. Unfortunately, I only read the reviews AFTER my nightmare adventure to the Aruba. It my have once been the site of a Las Vegas landmark but is now an absolute dump. And I was in a recently remodeled room. The first room they tried to give us had considerable daylight showing through the doojamb at the lock from being kicked in. The second room looked ok until 7am the next morning when another couple, with a key, walked in to my room!!! I complained to the management and was told I wouldn't be charged for that night's stay but that they couldn't give me a refund or even a receipt because it had been booked through Expedia. I finally got the gentleman at the desk to give me his name, after asking numerous times. Needless to ssay, we didn't stay there second night.
Now, 3 weeks later, I just got off the phone with Expedia and found that no refund had been submitted. Props to the people at Expedia though. When I explained everything that had happened, they said a complete refund would be issued within 2 days. BEWARE. IF IT WAS FREE, IT WOULD COST TOO MUCH!! DEFINATELY NOT A PLACE FOR CHILDREN!!!! AND SPA???? NEVER SAW ONE.
Room Tip: STAY AWAY. Pay a few dollars more and leave with your life. Definately not a place for families wit...

The closets has no backing. Elevator does not work. I had two different rooms no heat or AC smoke was coming out of units. One of the rooms TV did not work the other only had 1 channel. Desirables walking all around the floors. Both rooms had broken locks. My New Years Eve night was a nightmare. I felt like I was in an episode of Bad Boys tv show. I spoke to management and they said tuff luck they were under renovations. Their is a big tree in the middle of the so call lobby with a coffee pot at the office had old crud in the pot. Will report to the B.B.B. the only thing that was missing was an chalk outline of where a body was located. When you pull up you know it's a problem. Who the hell paints rooms and hotel green and burgundy colors. Thank goodness that the pool was closed there would have found the creature from the black lagoon coming out of it.
Room Tip: Run away keep driving
See more room tips</p><br>Right in the middle of cockroach and waterbug hotel.<p>First of all, the hooker by the front door kinda gave it away that this was not a 4 star hotel. Then, the drug dealers at the top of the third floor clinched it. If you came to vegas to get a hooker and drugs, then this is the place for you. We were so scared we ran away as fast as we could. The hotel front desk staff could not manage to work the key card equipment to show us a room and when he said he would fix the card, he never came back. If you would like to be on an episode of CSI Las Vegas, this is where you should stay. Can't guarantee you will make it till the morning, but it would be an adventure to see if you could.
Room Tip: Stay at a different hotel
See more room tips</p><br>What a dump!!!<p>The pictures I saw online were very misleading...this place is a total dump! I checked in, stopped at the bar to get a drink, and was served by the most unbearable, stuck up bartender who didn't even get my drink right. After seeing how completely FILTHY my room was, I couldn't even stay there. I should have checked the reviews online first. Don't stay here, the service and cleanliness is a total joke.</p><br>better off sleeping in your car<p>this hotel was the worst hotel i ever stood in first of all we booked the room in advance to make reservations then we got there at 1am on a friday and they told us they already rented our room out so we had to pay an additional for another room then we got the room and the door didn't lock to good the curtains fell of the rod in the bathroom there was no remote for the tv the beds felt like they were going to break i would not recommend this room to anybody you are better off saving your money and sleeping in your car</p><br>STAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS PLACE<p>We were dropping off relatives, who were vacationing from overseas, to this so-called hotel. But I realized that they weren't going to be safe here after looking at their room.

First of all, the elevator at this place was a metallic death trap, that had a broken air conditioning unit and was 10 degrees hotter than the outside temperature. When we entered the room, it smelled like it hadn't been aired out in months. One of the bedside lamps didn't have a switch to turn the light on/off. Instead there was a sharp metallic wire that protruded out where the switch should have been. There was no remote for the TV and the on/off button was broken. The AC unit in the room sounded like it was working and was set to its coldest temperature, but the room was like a sauna. There were only 2 small towels in the bathroom and the curtain rod was starting to rust.

We got tired of calling the front desk and complaining every 15 minutes, so we decided to switch rooms, but it didn't make a difference. The second room was just as bad as the first. There was no manager to complain to and the front desk clerk was trying to make excuses for the things that didn't work.

In the end, we decided to leave this place. The only problem was that we couldn't get back half of our payment. "Hotel policy" was the quote from our disrespectful front desk clerk.

This was the worst hotel experience of my life and I wasn't even going to stay there that night. I felt concerned for my relatives because they had 2 young kids with them. Thank goodness, we found a better hotel for them.

Please heed my warning and do not stay in this hotel. It is a deathtrap waiting to happen.
