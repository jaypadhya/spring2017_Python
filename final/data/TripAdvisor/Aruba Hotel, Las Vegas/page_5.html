<html><head><h3>Aruba Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 5</h3></head><body><br>Bad experience before I even got there!!!<p>I received the WORSE customer service ever before I even checked in to the hotel. I called the front desk to change my reservation to a future date. Sounds simple right??? The agent told me that I would have to call in on the day I reserved to cancel..I said if I do that I will get charged and he said well theres nothing I can do thats our policy and hung up on me. I called back several times to ask his name and to speak with a manager. He would pick up the phone and then hang up without even seeing who was on the other end. I faxed over a complaint and left my # for a manager to c/b and they never responded. I decided to check the reviews on this hotel and now I see why the service was terriable.</p><br>Do not stay here!!!<p>I was struggling to find somewhere to stay as it was the weekend and even though the reviews were bad I thought I would try the Aruba Hotel and Spa(!!), formerly the Thunderbird, but it was a big mistake.
Its not in the best part of town and a couple of miles from the main part of The Strip. The room itself was big but was right next to a generator room and there was a loud rattling noise throughout the night.
There was a large hole in the bathroom ceiling and it sounded like the people above were about to fall through any minute! There was no plug in the sink, holes in the curtains, no clothes hangers and an antiquated tv. The toilet was new but the bath was dirty and old. The shower had been fixed with tape.
The main door to the room was very thin and looked liked it had been through the wars. It didn't provide much confidence in security measures. The decoration in the room looked like it hadn't been touched in 20 years and there was interesting(!) pictures on the wall. The room was dark, smelly and there was flys in the bathroom.
Some of the staff didn't know what planet they were on and in the morning I found a large scratch on my car and no idea how it got there.
I booked this hotel through a very well known internet travel agency and it wasn't that cheap. The least I expected was a clean and safe place to stay.</p><br>Positive Experience<p>We made a reservation in mid-march at the Thunderbird Hotel (now the Aruba Hotel) based on two considerations: (1) There was a citywide convention in town and rooms were at a premium and (2) they offered a very attractive rate. It is important at this juncture that I add that I am also a travel agent and have stayed in marginal one-star propreties through the most luxurious six-star properties. During the cab ride from the airport to the hotel, we asked the cab driver about the hotel and he convinced us that we had made a horrible mistake. He was asked to wait while I spoke with the front desk. Upon entering the lobby area, I found it to be beautifully decorated and quite beautiful.
Surprise number one. Surprise number two came when I asked for the manager of the property (who appeared promptly) and was very candid and honest regarding my queery about the hotel, the quality of accommodations, safety, etc. She told me that they had recently acquired the property and that there were, in fact major renovations in progress. The roof work had been complete and most of the other issues which may cause a disturbance to the guests had been completed. They were now in the process of completely renovating the interior of each guest room, including repainting, installation of ceramic tile floors in each room, replacement of case goods (furniture, draperies and bedding) and modernization of fixtures, etc. As a travel agent, I asked to see both the before and after rooms. She placed me in one of the newly remodeled guest room and did not hesitate to show me an older room. Admittedly, it was tired in design and motif, but was clean. The new room was just that - new. It was also HUGE. New furniture (including a large work table with comfortable side chairs), new flooring, new draperies, etc. The only things that had not been replaced were the television and some of the fixtures, which were acceptable. We found not only the management but the entire staff to be pleasant, courteous and efficient. The hotel was also well staffed and did not have the appearance of a "Mom and Pop" operation. Coffee was provided in the lobby in the morning and cabs called promptly when requested, which also arrived in a timely fashion - not always the case in Las Vegas.

In short, we found the stay to be a totally positive experience and I would highly recommond the Aruba Hotel (formerly Thunderbird Hotel) to all guests looking for a moderate hotel in Las Vegas.</p><br>Honest to goodness review (you've been warned)...<p>This hotel is undergoing massive renovations as it was acquired two months ago by the new owners, so as the front desk says. Its got a new name, Aruba Hotel. The facade looks real good, as maybe it was the first to be finished. But dont let it fool you. What pisses me off is that they rent out rooms that are currently being renovated! My room is newly painted but the carpet looks like it had been pulled out from a mechanic's garage floor. Literally! I had to pull out the bed comforter and spread them on the floor to walk on! The bathroom is completely dilapidated it looked like a scene from a third world prison. No kidding. Construction materials lined the hallways, including new toilet bowls which I so envy to use! The TV was new during the Reagan era. No curtains here just blinds with missing panels which looked like they were plucked from the trash bin! I looked at the other rooms and they were all the same. I wont be surprised if something crawls out from under the bed! No double lock on the door, just measurement sketches on the jamb where they plan to install the locks. The lobby is dark and seedy. Dont ever use the crumbling elevators. My wife got stuck in it. The elevator entrance is even lined with trash bins. Why did they ever stay open during renovation! I hope the city inspectors would take a look at this place. This hotel might not be ready until maybe Novemeber '04 but until then better avoid this place! That is unless you like dust all over.</p><br>Not so bad!<p>Not as bad as indicated in previous reviews, but perhaps it is because the hotel is under new management, now known as the Aruba. Our room was clean, had blinds, etc etc. Sparsely furnished and it needed a new tv, but what do you expect for $30 a night? Recommended.</p><br>Unsafe and unpleasant -  Thunderbird Hotel, Las Vegas<p>Stringly advise you not to stay inspite of low rates!!Here's our experience:1)There were NO blinds on the windows facing the hallway. So the people passing through could SEE US day or night. The front desk and management said they could NOT do anything about it.2)There were no light bulbs in the rooms. We got only ONE light bulb from the front desk and had to do with it.3) The taps, faucets and bathrooms were corroded and leaking.4) The TV was not working well.5) There were MAJOR roof repairs going on. On the last day (Nov 30, Sunday) the roof repairs started at 7:00 am and were taking place directly above our room. The noise was EXTREMELY LOUD and the plaster from the ceiling was FALLING on the carpet. We called the front desk but they said there was nothing they could do! Since we were feeling so unsafe and angry we called 911 and explained the situation to them. We immediately checked out of the hotel.</p><br>This is by far the WORST place I've ever stayed<p>This "resort" was filthy, seedy, and one step away from having hourly rates. Don't let the well furnished lobby or the pictures of their rooms online fool you. There is nothing good to say about the Thunderbird, even the parking lots is sketchy, I didn't want to leave my car there over night. The towels and blankets are awful, I was scared to walk barefoot on the carpet, and I didn't even want to go near the bathroom, I was better off not taking a shower. DO NOT STAY HERE!! I broke out in a rash from something in the bed, was shocked multiple times trying to use an outlet and slept with one eye open. If you're trying to save money, you're better off sleeping in your car.</p><br>Do Not Stay Here!!<p>The rooms were dirty, carpets filthy, beds unmade or had hair in them. We were shown three rooms before finally accepting one. Even then the bedding and towels were stained ( they did change them for cleaner ones), the light fittings falling from the ceiling. If it had not been late when we arrived and Labor day weekend we would have looked for somewhere else.</p><br>Do not stay here<p>Stay away from this motel. Although the lobby was nice, the rooms are beyond nasty. The door didn't close properly and the carpet and bathroom were stained and dirty. And to top it off, it is located near many adult shops, in a seedy neighborhood. Spend the extra money and stay at a nice hotel, but if budget is tight, stay at a Motel 6 instead.</p><br></body></html>
