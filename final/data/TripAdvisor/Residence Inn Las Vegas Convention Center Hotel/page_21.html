It was nice getting away from the Strip's hustle and bustle. Even though it's only a few blocks and about 600 ft from the Strip, it's pretty quiet.

The check-in staff was very friendly and not arrogant like some other upscale hotels towards Priceline guests. Bellman offered assistance and let us use his luggage cart without him assisting and expecting tip.

Best thing though was the room. Beautiful decor, very nice setup, great shampoo/soap products, and a very comfortable bed with comforter. We also stayed at the Mirage during our Vegas trip and the beds there felt like military bunks compared to Marriott.

Outdoor pool/hot tub area is located on the west side of the building so there is limited morning sun (at least in April), and the pool was pretty cold. Clean towels available outside though and easily accessible from the room.

Parking is a 3-story garage, also adjacent to the rooms. We did not try the onsite restaurant.

I'd love to return to this place, even if I was here on vacation.</p><br>Helpful Staff Facilities Worn Good Breakfast<p>Across the street from the convention center so extremely convenient. Free bus shuttle from the street corner to the Wynn Hotel on the strip which was much better than the monorail. Staff very helpful and the breakfast was pretty good for being free. Rooms, while clean, could use an update.</p><br>Spacious but...tatty<p>Just got back from this Residence Inn...we have stayed at several around the country and been quite pleased (when value for money outweighed desire for luxury)...so we thought we knew what to expect. The apartment style layout worked quite well (though not if you had a lot of baggage/shopping to trundle about) and our apartment was kept quite clean...and yes, lots of space...but our suite and everything in it was shabby and seemed well-worn...the carpet looked like it needed a good clean, the kitchen counter had a chunk out of it, one of the kitchen cabinet doors - all of which were pretty beat-up, was practically falling off...big cracks in the vinyl flooring, the sliding door to the bathroom was very difficult to close and open and wouldnt stay on its track....

Two other problems - the Residence Inn breakfast (which doesn't vary much from one to another) was ok...but every time we went to sit at a table out by the pool, the tabletops were filthy...all it would have taken was for one of the staff to walk round with a quick spray bottle of cleaner and a paper towel...I mean it put us off our food, every day! This was also the case in the evening, too, when various drinks and food were offered.

This location is fine if you are attending a convention across the street, but we were at the Sands Convention Center (unbeknownst to us) which is another location entirely (near Venetian). So be careful about that. When we wanted to go to the Strip (every day/night) for meals, a show, etc., the monorail across the street did not seem to run as often as we'd hoped...and to get a cab from this location can be tricky at best and a nightmare at worst...you cannot hail a cab in Vegas, the desk will call one for you, and it can take up to half an hour or 45 minutes depending on traffic....this is pretty stressful. Oh yes - it also would have helped if some of the staff seemed to know more about Las Vegas itself...a few of them tried to be helpful but seemed no more aware of what was going on in the area than we were.

Sure, it's the Residence Inn and not the Bellagio, so you cannot expect a masterful team of concierges, a valet taxi service, etc.....but they could at least repair some of the broken down furnishings and clean those tables.</p><br>Perfect in every way<p>We had a great stay! I was so glad to have stayed here when I saw the long hotel registration lines on the strip. The thought of dragging the kids through a casino with their luggage scares me, but at the Residence Inn we didnt have to worry about that. The breakfast was very good, scrambled eggs, french toast, muffins, danish, donuts, oatmeal, sausage, potatoes, etc... not bad for free. I did not have a chance to enjoy the pool but I did appreciate the doggie doo doo bags placed in the grass areas, we took our Shih Tzu with us. All in all a great place, I really like this compared to other Residence Inns because each unit was two stories and the kids hung out upstairs and watched their own tv. I will definately stay here again.</p><br>Fab!<p>I stayed here with three friends over the New Year's period of 2004. It wasn't our first choice but all the hotels in our price range on the Strip were fully booked, so as i'd stayed at a Residence Inn in Orlando before, and loved it, decided to book in to the Las Vegas one, and i can honestly say, i have no complaints about this hotel. The beds were fantastic, so much so, that we didn't want to get out of them! The mini apartments are brilliant with all the comforts of home, and the TVs in each room meant no arguements over who wanted to watch what! The free breakfast is great, and also the daily free evening snacks and drinks. Someone mentioned about it being dangerous to walk around that section of Las Vegas, but we walked up to the Strip during the day and later in the night and we had no problems, but if you don't want to walk, the monorail is a fantastic cheap alternative which will drop you in the heart of the Strip by the Flamingo hotel. I'd definately consider staying here again if i ever go to Las Vegas again, the hotel was great, the front desk staff were friendly and helpful, and i had a brilliant time in Vegas!</p><br>Great layout<p>This is a great location if you want to be near the strip but not on it. It's also across the street from the convention center & a monorail stop. The lodging is very good, especially for a family on a multi-day trip. They are basically townhouses with a full kitchen & living room & a separate bed/bath on each level. We missed the free breakfast so we can't comment on that. However, it's slightly annoying that you must drive/walk over to the lobby building for the breakfast.</p><br>Great For the Family<p>This place is a gold mine! We stayed the first week of April with my family of five which includes my three little ones all under the age of six. The staff was very friendly especially the front desk clerk, (Helenea). They were more than accomodating for family needs. The room was spacious and very clean. It was multi-level with an upstairs loft, and it had three TV's (One for each room). The kitchen was fully equipped with all the amenities needed for a short or long term stay.
The free breakfast in the morning was more than substantial to start the day. Each section of the hotel had it's own spa and the fitness center located in the adjacent Marriott was nice. The grounds were clean and secure with adequate parking. Overall, a great experience.</p><br>Good family spot, not for business travelers<p>I stayed here for one night on a business trip last week, not being able to get a room at a rate that I usually pay at the usual hotels I stay at in Las Vegas. This property is just fine, but average. If you want to feel like you're staying at any other town with a Residence Inn, this is your place. It is quietly sequestered amidst larger hotels within walking distance of the convention center, with trees, nicely kept grounds, pool, whirlpool, and several barbecue areas with modern gas barbecues. The rooms are all suites, with full kitchens, modern appliances. They are not fancy, but clean, utilitarian and good values for families or groups of people wanting to share a suite and save on lodging expenses. There is a continental style breakfast with a few hot items, making it more than continental style, but the hot items are scrambled eggs, french toast, and oatmeal. There are restaurants nearby, but you really need a car or cab to get to them; walking is dangerous or simply too far a jaunt. The staff are very nice. There is no casino on-site, a plus for anyone who goes to Las Vegas frequently, but doesn't want to gamble. This property is a very good value for families, but it was not what most business travelers, couples or anyone out for partying would look for.</p><br>Great<p>I've stayed here many times for conventions. The staff is great, the units are well-kept, you can walk to the convention center, parking is easy.... what more do you want?</p><br>Better than my apartment<p>We stayed here on the way back from the Grand Canyon for 2 nights. Prices were high for some reason that particular weekend in Vegas and our group wanted to stay together. I booked the penthouse suite for 4 of us but can accommodate up to 6. At a rate of $ 112.00 per night ! The hotel is very much off the Strip, good to have a car staying in this area but with the new monorail opening next year (2004), will make transportation easier without rental car straight to the Strip. There was no check-in waiting, no casino noise blaring, no choking cigarette smoke. The pleasant staff assisted us, the layout was little bit confusing, took couple of tries to find our unit. This Residence Inn is set up like an apartment complex with little streets, people saying hello when walking by. Each 4-5 unit had Jacuzzi which was very nice and relaxing. Our unit was fabulous, bi level penthouse, full kitchen, dining room with living room, 2 baths, fire place, Murphy bed plus pull-out sofa bed and another bed upstairs with living room also, whatever you need it's there. On the top level we could get a glance of the strip. Overall it is a great hotel. I highly recommend !</p><br></body></html>
