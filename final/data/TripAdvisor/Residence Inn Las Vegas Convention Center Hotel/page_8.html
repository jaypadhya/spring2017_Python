<html><head><h3>Residence Inn Las Vegas Convention Center Hotel Reviews Page 8</h3></head><body><br>Nothing Special, Despite the Location<p>As a Marriott Elite member, I've stayed in many excellent Marriott properties; this is not one of them. Convenient location across the street from the convention center, but a 15 minute walk to the strip that can be dangerous at night. The room was standard for the Residence Inn brand...fridge, microwave, stove, etc... It was clean, however my wife, while drawing a bath, found hairs in the tub...Ughh...she showered instead. There is no elevator, so if you're traveling with luggage, as we were, be sure to get a ground floor room. The front desk neglected to mention the fact, which required a room switch. The only ice available is in the fridge/freezer, so you will have to wait a couple of hours for it to make cubes. The breakfast is standard fare, although you are advised to eat early. By the time we arrived, the cool scrambled eggs, cool sausage and other assorted empty servers were evidence that the crowd had overwhelmed the staff. This is a VERY pet-friendly hotel, although we did not notice any evidence of that in our room. Overall, a very average hotel/
Room Tip: There is no elevator, so if traveling with luggage, get a ground floor room.

Our apartment here was nicer than any place that I have ever resided. I could have moved in here permanently, and we were sad to check out.

I do not recommend staying here if you do not have a car as taxis do not station here, you will have to call one and wait. There is no restaurant within safe walking distance and the surrounding neighborhood is "okay" but not safe for unescorted women. Best to have a group of people if you are walking around outside the hotel. But the SLS hotel is right next door with many services. The convention center and monorail is across the street. The Vegas strip is a few blocks aways and easy to navigate to and we had an easy time pulling in and out of many hotels and returning to the Residence Inn.

Also, there is no one here to help you with your bags, and if you take a 2nd floor apartment, you will have to carry your stuff up 2 flights of stairs.

It's like moving into an apartment. Parking is free and easy but it is a walk to the apartment entrance for many units. Have a bag with wheels.

All apartments are smoke free!!

The staff was very accomodating with our requests for late checkout, extra towels, and shampoo, bed size, and getting a pet free room. We wish they would ban pets altogether from this property--it's hard enough maintaining a hotel and keeping a room clean with humans moving in and out regularly, let alone have to deal with a poop factory running around. We usually try to avoid hotels and motels that allow pets.

The towel quality was better than you will find at most hotels, but not as good as a 5-star hotel. They are all branded, "Marriott."

The room was very clean, housekeeping did a very good job, and I was not able to find one stray hair anywhere from a prior guest.

They have a small pool that we did not use at all. On Saturday night, we walked by and it was jammed with adults and children all conversing in spanish.

Free breakfast is provided and the best part of it was the OATMEAL!!! The Oatmeal was incredible and the only reason I did not skip breakfast. They also had an excellent make your own waffle (M to F only) and Activia yogurt and bananas. Disappointingly, they did not have any hard boiled eggs! I have stayed in many a free breakfast hotel around the USA and hard boiled eggs are a staple these days at Holiday Inn and Hyatt and other chains. I was disappointed. The fake scrambled yellow eggs and frozen heated breakfast potatoes were inedible and should be immediately discontinued--I have never tasted anything so disgusting at a hotel breakfast.

As a side note, we interestingly watched what folks were eating at breakfast since you can take anything you like. Amazingly, it's the most overweight and obese people that put on their plate the most unhealthy and fattening foods--it was a pure example of what is wrong with the American diet. More education is needed.

Maybe Marriott can set the example for healthy breakfast (and reduced health insurance costs) by eliminating certain foods like the yellow eggs, greasy potatoes, sausage, and bacon, and replacing it with egg whites, more whole grain cereals, gluten free breads, and a bowl of fruit, yogurt to start the day. That along with oatmeal will better our country more than anything Congress has done.

Wish List:

Last, I would replace the cloth sofas with leather ones. It's gross to sit on a cloth sofa you cannot clean and have no idea who did what on?...With leather, housekeeping can take a wet rag and clean it to new for every new resident--much more sanitary.
Room Tip: If you take a room near the pool on swimming days, you will have lots of kids yelling outside your d...

Clean rooms, free breakfast in the morning, across from the convention center and tram that leads to main strip. Pet friendly, they charge a $100 NON-refundable fee for pets (which comes out to $112 with taxes).

Now on to the issues with the charges. I got 4 rooms, 3 of them reserved through the Marriott. I specified I wanted the rooms to be charged to my card that I gave, and I was told on the phone that was fine, all that the guests needed to do was show an ID and credit card for incidentals. Upon check in I spoke to the person at the desk and asked the same question, just to confirm my guests didn't get charged and he said all they needed to show was an ID and credit card. Now a week has passed and one of my guests has been charged their room. When I called to have the issue corrected the lady at the hotel asked for my card information again to make the corrections and that it would take a few days to process. A few days have passed and still nothing. Upon calling back again the guy tells me no correction has been made and no reversal can be done since the rooms have already been charged.

So if I ever happen to stay at this hotel again I will make sure to book through Hotels.com or something. The 4th room I booked had no issues, and that was with Hotels.com. Only the ones I booked directly through the Marriott had the issues. I was unable to review all the receipts left at the rooms upon check out to make sure everything was done properly because my party and I had to make it to my wedding ceremony. So disappointed.</p><br>Great Stay!<p>I stayed at the Residence Inn Suites for a convention I was attending. The staff at the front desk was so nice. My room was very clean and cute. It's so close to the convention center I was able to just cross the street for the convention I was attending.</p><br>Good overnight stop<p>Comfortable hotel with rooms in house type blocks around a pleasant shady garden and pool. Rooms comfortable with kitchen facilities. Only problem is that upstairs rooms do not have lifts. Air conditioning was efficient but noisy. Breakfast was adequate. We arrived late so did not have time to go out but the on site Bistro provided snacks. Good value.
Room Tip: There are no lifts so if you find stairs difficult ask for a downstairs room Rooms facing the gard...
See more room tips</p><br>perfect hotel<p>We had a soccer tournament in Las Vegas for the long weekend (Labor Day Weekend). Our soccer family ended up renting a total of 19 rooms. We do not have any complaints at all. All of our rooms were ready when we got their. The rooms are really nice, clean and spacious. We asked for ALL the rooms to be close to the pool and that is exactly what we got. We all went on a Bus. The Hotel reserved room in their parking for our bus. The Free breakfast was also really good. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone any ime. And it's also really close to the strip. Loved the place.</p><br>Great Alternative to strip hotel<p>It is a nice alternative to the typical Vegas high rise hotel and offers many conveniences including adequate parking. The kitchen was fully equipped with all the amenities needed for a short or long term stay. The property is pretty quiet which is good for light sleeper. The breakfast is also good like any other RI. Although the breakfast area gets pretty crowded during holidays but they have enough seating provisions. Recommended.</p><br>A much underrated location in the city of massive hotels.<p>I came to Vegas to attend the WSA@magic (17-23 Aug 2014) convention at the convention center for the second time this year. I booked this property months in advance due to our normal hotel was overbooked. It could not have been anymore of a blessing that our normal hotel was booked and I went with this property. Before leaving I checked the ratings of the property which appeared to be fairly decent. My colleague and I are not that picky when it comes to hotels, but we do have some requirements all of which this property met.

First Impression:

When we arrived at like 3 in the morning a day later than what we had reserved the rooms for, the hotel staff at the desk was able to retrieve our booking which was cancelled that day before we arrived and was able to reactivate it without any issues. We were late due to flight issues from LAX to LAS, we basically was held up by a day.. We should have driven there it would have been faster. When we first arrived at the property it was very quiet, and not like the other hotels we have stayed in before. I knew that this was not one of those 3 or 4 star properties where the bellmen will come out and help you to the front desk. The lobby area is open and inviting. The front desk staff appeared to be friendly and from what I could see from the days the followed that it carried on to all staff members. The breakfast area was pointed out to us, which it looked very nice.

Environment:

Walking from the registration to our room out in the night air was a blessing. We found out the hard way not to breathe until we get to the elevator in most other hotels in Vegas due to the amount of smoke, but not this place. We had to walk past the pool area which looked very nice and well kept. The paths and gardens going to the areas where our rooms were was just a delight to see. The greenery and just about everything around the property was excellent and appealing to the eyes.

Rooms:

When I first opened the room door and looked in, I could not have been any more pleased at what I saw. Firstly I was more excited about a full kitchen than I was anything else at that moment. Just about everything is thought of when it comes to the kitchen area. The living space was very nicely decorated and was comfortable to sit on. The TV and programming that you have access too with it was also very nice.

The bed.. aaaah the bed.. I’ve traveled all over the world and stayed in many hotels and this I must say is the first bed I have slept in that was truly awesome. Sleeping on this bed was like sleeping on a giant pillow that just wrapped around you as you slept. To say the bed was extremely comfortable would be an understatement and would not do the bed justice. The bathroom was ok, nothing too much or less to look at. I was however a bit taken that the bathroom door is missing a handle (Room 1712). I was unsure if this was to be like this due to the door sliding between the walls or what. I did not let that change my thoughts about the property because everything else outweighed a missing door handle.

Restaurant:

The breakfast was fairly good, and it they had a variety of things to eat that should suit anyone’s tastes. I loved the waffle makers as well as the actual real English muffins and rotating toaster. In my travels around the world I don’t see these things often so it was nice. The dining area was a bit crowded with people, however they had plenty of seating and it just took some dancing around others to get what you are looking for. The quality of the food was very nice, the eggs were well cooked which is often hard to keep looking good after being in the warmers for some time. I did notice a bit of browning on the eggs, however that could have been when they were being made. If it is due to being exposed to the air too long, I would recommend to the cooks to add a bit of lemon juice to the egg mix before cooking. It will help keep the eggs from browning or turning green after long exposure to the air or warming pans.

The selection of pancakes and other breakfast items was excellent. I would have liked to see a few other juice selections other than orange however. It did not really matter as the entire dining experience as a whole was very good. If there was one thing I would recommend, it would have to be the breakfast times. Breakfast ends at 9am Mon-Fri if I am not mistaken, which really should be pushed to 930 for the weekdays and 10am for weekends.

Additional Information:

In the lobby area they have a small convenience store like pantry that you can purchase various foods from at a sort of higher price than that of the nearby markets, however they do have a good selection of items to buy and at 3am in the morning after a 20+ hour flight you don’t care what something costs, you only want it if it is easy to get to at that time.

Staff:

From the moment we arrived until the moment we left, the hotel staff both front desk, housekeepers and groundskeepers were top notch. They took care of the clients that came to them with little or no fail. Need a taxi, not a problem they will have one there in a few moments, need information about nearby events and so on.. They have you covered. It was a great thing to see as in most hotels you don’t get this friendly service.

Overall Views:

My team and I could not have been anymore pleased with our choice to stay at this location. It was right on the other side of the road from the convention center which only took a 5 min walk to get to, the area is semi quiet as compared to being on the strip, less congested and no smoke as you walk in the lobby. The environment and the upkeep of the surrounding areas are very nice and appears that they have a dedicated staff to tend to the grounds making it what it is. The staff is awesome and I would like to call out one or two of them for their fine service, but it would not be fair to the others. With that being said I have to say that all of the staff was excellent. The rooms exceeded my expectations of which I was pleasantly surprised on entering my room.

My team and I have already decided that on our next return in February for the same show we will be staying at this property, we have actually recommended the property in our board meeting this past week so that other from our group can make arrangements to stay there during their time for meetings and so on.

Other than the things I said above about the door handle, and breakfast times, I have no complaint what so ever about this property. This property has left a long and positive thought in my teams mind and we would be more than happy to return in the future.
Room Tip: If you have trouble walking or do not have a rental car try to get a room closer to the lobby area.
See more room tips</p><br>Quiet spot away from the Strip<p>I stayed here for a conference and booked well in advance, as I wanted to have a kitchen. This is a typical Residence Inn; a big room with space to spread out and a serviceable kitchen. The decor was a little tired, but not dingy. It's an easy walk (if hot) to the convention center and the monorail, which was perfect for me. I could walk back for lunch and avoid the lines and prices at the convention center food court. But a car is essential, so be aware if you are here for a conference. There aren't restaurants or grocery stores in walking distance, although you can pay to get your fridge stocked by the hotel staff. I had planned on a renting a car, as a trip to Nevada meant a visit to In-n-Out Burger, which is either a drive or a cab ride from the hotel. I visited a few grocery stores and the Vons at Twain & Maryland was probably the best in the area, although it's probably worth driving farther to visit a Sprouts, Whole Foods or Trader Joe's.

The breakfast is pretty standard, but I mostly ate in my room. I did not use the pool, so I can't comment on others' complaints.

The monorail is overpriced, but it's worth it. I rode a conference bus to the Strip once, and it took forever due to the traffic. Buy a day pass and check Groupon, etc. for deals</p><br>Not bad for an older Hotel<p>Older hotel, but clean. Nothing spectacular. Excellent desk staff. Their in-room wireless could be stronger, it kept dropping out where we were. The breakfast was good, a decent variety of food.
The pool could use a bit more skimming, but the water was clean.
Since we were out and about all day, we weren't looking for a lot more.
The fold-out sofa was uncomfortable, they could stand an upgrade on those.
not the place to stay if you want the whole "Las Vegas experience", but for a basic place to stay while exploring the city, it was decent, close to the strip, and reasonably priced.</p><br></body></html>
