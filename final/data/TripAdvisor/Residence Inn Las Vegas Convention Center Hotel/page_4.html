<html><head><h3>Residence Inn Las Vegas Convention Center Hotel Reviews Page 4</h3></head><body><br>Okay stay<p>This was an okay hotel. The room was cleanish, but smelled of smoke. Unfortunatly the entire city was booked so we didn't have many options. The staff was nice enough when we arrived and breakfast was pretty good.</p><br>Nice Off-Strip Stay<p>Like all Residence Inns, this hotel is clean, has a full kitchen, complimentary breakfast and Wi-Fi. The location is nice, with grass and trees which keeps the place a little cooler. It was nice to avoid the $20-$30/night resort charge that all of the casinos charge and walking through a smoke-filled casino to get to your room. From the hotel it is a 5 minute drive to the entrance of the Wynn and/or the Bellagio covered parking lots and you don't have to deal with driving on the strip.</p><br>Always a positive experience<p>I've actually stayed at this hotel many times over the years and really never had a bad experience. The rooms are clean, spacious, and comfortable. Litterally my only complaint is that there aren't enough chairs. The room we stayed in was kinda designed as a little studio apartment, it will fit 4 people comfortably, but there is only one chair at the little table.

Also, and this is kind of odd but maybe relevant? The bathtub is surprisingly comfortable for sleeping in. I have no idea why this came up, but two of the people I stayed with spent a night in the tub.

Other downside is they don't actually have role-aways, so if you are hurting for separate beds, spring for a loft-room. They do have pull-out coaches, I think they're ok but my suite mates couldn't stand them. The main bed is actually one of the most comfortable hotel beds I've ever laid on.

I would also like to mention that the service was FANTASTIC. We didn't need much, but the concierge was so friendly and polite that it made me feel very welcome and at ease.

One last thought: it is actually a short and safe walk to the strip. Most off-strip hotels are a bit iffy, but this one just just one large, busy, well-lit road away. We walked back after midnight and there were many other people out with us in the same area.

On the whole, I have nothing but good things to say about this place. If you are going to the convention center, you cannot go wrong.
Room Tip: Get something towards the back if you want quiet.

It is not as polished as many of the other Residence Inn's but is a decent place to stay. It is directly across from the Convention center and that is very convenient. There are a lot of birds that are in the outdoor eating area and they are a nuisance.</p><br>Convenient for running around Vegas<p>The Residence Inn has a tree shaded campus with birds singing in the trees, Because it is away from the street, it is a quiet place. It is within walking distance of restaurants, has been here about at least 20 years and is well kept up. Located in the middle of the walkway between rooms and near the pool is a grill (on which we wished we had bought a steak to eat). In the rooms are kitchens, so if you don't want to go out, you don't have to.
The pool was inviting, but the water was a bit chilly. However, I did see much heartier people in it. There is also a small tennis court on the property.
We've stayed here before and so we go out of our way to get it again. I went with friends and while the husbands were at work, we "wives" got to see Las Vegas ourselves. Used the Monorail to get back and forth from the Strip. Very easy.
The breakfasts were full of everything you would want-eggs, sausage, potatoes, oatmeal, waffles, pastries. 3 nights during the week there is a reception with food and drink, if you don't go out to a show in town.
Booking again if I have the chance.
Room Tip: We've stayed in the back and the front of the complex, and it is only 2 stories, so there isn...

The location is perfect just across the street from the convention center.

The staff was super friendly and helpful

The problem is the hotel itself, it looks like you travel in time 20 years.... Really outdated except the new flat TV

If you are in a top floor you have stairs... If you are in the bottom then you hear a lot of noise from whoever is above you or even next to you, the soundproofing is horrible and if they walk you hear them if they take a shower too....

Beds were small and kind of itchy.....

You have a great kitchen but the closest supermarket is nowhere to be found

Also the carpet between the kitchen and the living room ends in an awkward place were you have the chit for your desk and it does not work well

Also there are no additional outlets To charge phones computers etc.

From now on I will check how many years old the hotel is and when was the last remodeling job done</p><br>Excellent Customer Service!<p>Susan from the front desk was so helpful and remained calm and courteous the whole time when we experienced a little problem with our reservation. She was able to find us a solution that made us feel secure and comfortable! The hotel is great!!! Very clean and quiet. I will definiteltycome back to this hotel and recommend to other people!</p><br>Across street from Convention Center and equipped with kitchens<p>This place is great for long term stays or stays in which you want or need a kitchen (such as prepping for the food show across the street). Consistent with Residence Inn quality and style. I found the front desk staff engaging and super helpful (always called us taxis) and the free breakfast was decent.

Thank you - will stay again

If you have 3 or more, request one of the two story loft rooms</p><br>Spot on place to stay<p>I stayed here for 4 weeks while working there in January. Hopefully stay there again if I am ever back out in Vegas for work again.
The staff were excellent and very helpful, especially the front desk. Breakfast was superb and the meals they put on at night were very good also. Ideal to have after work before you go out to visit the strip.
I had a 2 bedroom suite/apartment. Excellent, plenty room and storage space and good amenities in the kitchen. We used the bbq ,which was just outside our room, most nights.
Walk to the strip is approximately 10min. We would walk to the stratosphere at the weekends to start our nights out there and the $20 all you can drink from 6-10pm which is part of the take back Vegas campaign which is going on out there in certain hotels. Good way to have a few drinks and not pay a fortune like you would in other bars.
All in all I had a great stay at this hotel and look forward to staying there again.
Room Tip: Ideal location if you are using the convention centre, it's directly opposite.
See more room tips</p><br>Not consistent with Marriott quality<p>I am a Marriott consumer because I can always count on consistent quality. But this experience has surprised me. This stay was a one night stop-over from a vacation in So. Cal (where our experience in Oceanside Courtyard Marriott was great). In my room, I picked up my toddler from crawling around on the floor and she had black hands. My other kid has black soled feet from walking around the room without shoes. We went to the pool at 11:00am and it was so dirty. There was much tree debris in the water and on the pool floor, and there was some shimmery oily film on the water. I spend about 15 minutes skimming debris off the surface with the net but there is so much in the pool, I don't feel I should be the one doing it. I complained to the front desk but was shown not a lot of enthusiasm for getting it resolved. And there are no pool towels to be found.

I am not usually a complaining person but this motivated me enough to spend time writing this review. I hate that I wasted my Rewards night in this place.</p><br></body></html>
