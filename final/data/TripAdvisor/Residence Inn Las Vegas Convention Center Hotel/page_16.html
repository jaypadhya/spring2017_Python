<html><head><h3>Residence Inn Las Vegas Convention Center Hotel Reviews Page 16</h3></head><body><br>Perfect off-strip hotel<p>This is the perfect place to stay if you need to be near the strip or the convention center and dont want to stay on the strip. The staff there was so friendly and helpful. We arrived very early and early check-in was no problem. The room was clean and comfortable. It is close to the monorail, which is a better way to get to the strip than to fight the traffic. The breakfast offerings are not gourmet but were just fine for what we needed. We would definitely stay there again.</p><br>great off the strip vegas<p>We were in Vegas for a soccer tournament with teenagers. We had a two room suite shared with another Mom& daughter.Full kitchen was great.Only down side was we didn't get breakfast due to our game times.We bought food at the AMAZING whole foods by the airport
ate out only one out of three nights and saved loads of money! We spent the money on the rides at the stratosphere well worth it for your dare devil teens!!We had a Jacuzzi outside our rooms shared with a few units.Jets didn't work though, but was nice and hot for sore legs.
Will definitely stay again.
Room Tip: Upper 2 room suite quiet room 924.

We travel with pets, so any location that allows dogs is already high on our list. This location is owned and operated by the mother ship, Marriott International, so pets are allowed as long as you sign a waiver and pay a $100 fee.

There is no need to be squeamish about the room, you know it's clean, so take off your shoes, walk around and your socks stay clean. The pool chemicals are balanced and water is clear. The staff is friendly, the parking lot is well lit, security is visible but unobtrusive and you feel safe. This location has been remodeled so the amenities are fresh.

The people mover station is right across the street. Yes, the experience can be a little vanilla by Las Vegas standards, but it's a nice getaway from all the glitzy plastic that Vegas is known for. This location is very close to the strip, with many great "off the strip" places to dine in the immediate vicinity.

Efficiency that can rival a German railroad can have it's ups and downs. When we arrived we were told that check-in was at 4 p.m. and absolutely no rooms would be available before that time. Trying to find entertainment for family and dogs while the room is being readied proved harder than expected. When I inquired if the desk clerk could take my cell number and call me if a room opened earlier, Chris told me they had a lot of experience doing this, and absolutely no room would be open before the 4 p.m. I'm not sure how several hundred rooms all come clean at precisely the appointed hour. On the flip side, we were extended the courtesy of a late check out. So, everything balanced out...just as you expect at a Marriott.
Room Tip: great place for our pups !!! :D
See more room tips</p><br>Las Vegas trip<p>Just spent a week at this facility for vacation. Pet friendly and right across the street from the Las Vegas convention center and monorail. We had a 2 bedroom suite with full kitchen. Room was spotless, grounds were spotless. Staff was very friendly. Exercise facility is next door in the Marriott Courtyard, which worked well for my morning Starbucks afterwards. I will stay there again. Five Stars!! If you don't want to be on the strip, this is the place to be.</p><br>tiny oasis in the midst of Vegas<p>I chose the Residence Inn because of its location: right across the street from the Convention Center and a monorail station. I also wanted a place with a kitchen to save money from having to eat out.

I was pleasantly surprised by how well it is hidden from the busy thoroughfare and smoky, neon-lit Vegas. The pool, while not big, was well maintained, as was the outdoor hot-tub. The breakfast included a wide variety of foods, including my daughter's favorite: make-your-own waffle.

The room was not huge--with the sofa opened into a bed, there is not much space left--but it was comfortable.

The only problem I encountered happened two nights in a row: the plumbing in the sink started knocking. The only way I discovered to make it stop was to fill the sink with water and then remove the stopper, not exactly a viable option. Because the sink was very close to the bed, I was kept awake.

If I return for the same event next year, I will very likely choose this place again.</p><br>Great non casino<p>Fantastic staff, front desk, breakfast, reception and housekeeping. Location is convenient off strip, across from convention center with easy access to gated parking lot. Had a fantastic stay!</p><br>Great for Convention Center attendees<p>Stayed at this hotel for a week, chose it for its proximity to the LV Convention Center.

The LVCC is within "true" walking distance, about two city blocks total, right across the street from the hotel. To us this was priceless.

The hotel is not on the strip; we don't gamble so we did not care. However the monorail will take you in a flash.

The room was large and the kitchen very well equipped. You park your car right by your room. The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful.

I definitely recommend this hotel and would return.</p><br>Not cheap, but you get a lot for your money<p>This is a very nice oasis in the craziness of Las Vegas, with a gated parking lot, lovely trees and landscaping, nice pool and hot tub, picnic tables and grills to cook out on, not to mention your own kitchen! A generous free hot breakfast is provided on site and while we were there, several evenings of snacks/refreshments available for free, but i don't think they do that every night. We had a queen studio room with sofa bed, which was on a single level (there are some suites with upstairs/downstairs). The desk was spacious, probably the largest i have seen anywhere, but it also doubles as the dining table. It has a shelf above, where you could stash work papers and laptop if you need the table for eating a meal. There is also a complete kitchen and fireplace. My only complaint would be that if you do have someone sleeping in the sofabed, it takes up an awful lot of space when pulled open. Otherwise, there is plenty of room for relaxing on the sofa and watching tv, working at the desk and working in the kitchen, even in this smallest setup. As i said, this place is not a cheap budget place, but compares favorably in price to other places in Las Vegas where you would get a lot less. For a family looking for breakfast included in the room price or to eat in the room on occasion, stash snacks or leftovers from restaurant meals in the fridge, it could still add up to be a money saver in the long run.
Room Tip: Be aware that some suites have 2 levels, needing to climb stairs.
See more room tips</p><br>We have stayed in better.<p>Definitely not the worst, but not the best either. Between the dogs barking underneath us, and the knock-down drag-out fight going on most of the night, it was NOT a restful stay. However, the staff was great and very accommodating.</p><br>Perfect Hotel for Tradeshow Attendees!<p>I went to Vegas to attend a huge automotive trade show a few weeks ago. Our travel person at work booked this hotel and I couldn't have been happier. First, it is DIRECTLY in front of the Las Vegas Convention Center....you literally only needed to walk across the street and you were there. Second it was really clean and the staff were incredibly accommodating. Being away from the hustle and bustle was nice and the fact that the Monorail stop is across the street as well was a huge bonus!
Room Tip: All of the buildings seemed equivalent!
