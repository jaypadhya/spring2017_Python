No traffic to fight with, no cab lines to deal with, no wasted time. That was great. The rooms were quiet and the place pleasant. The breakfast was decent and the staff friendly. I believe that some rooms have been updated as I was told by a coworker that my room was newer and upgraded. The hotel obviously misses much of what many like about Vegas. No casino, no hustle bustle and nothing of note within an easy walk. But it is therefore more family friendly.</p><br>Vegas weekend<p>This is a Great off the strip Vegas hotel with free breakfast and dinner. Youâ€™re in walking distance to the tram that takes you down to the strip so you don't have to drive and find parking. The rooms are ok they are not up to what I have seen at of other Marriot Residence Inns. The property is setup like a small condo complex. The buildings are two and three store buildings. The pool is nice but small.</p><br>Nice large rooms, service inconsistent<p>This is an old Ski lodge type. The 2-bedroom ones have a loft with a murphy bed that works great for a couple kids. Overall i would stay here again, but not my first choice. Clean. Checkin was slow, we ended up waiting a couple hours for our room which speaks to the primary issue - the front desk staff on duty at the time was disinterested and that is a nice way of saying it. She did not take the initiative to try and resolve our room issue with housekeeping, rather just waited around for housekeeping to do their usual routine. The night lady and another guy were great, i just think that this person is no particularly interested in a high level or service. Overall, breakfasts were good, pool was good. No gym - be advised. You have to go next door to the courtyard (common ownership) but that worked out OK, their gym was good.
Room Tip: get the two bedroom if you can with the loft. The kids will love it

He was friendly, helpful, and all smiles...definitely lifted my mood after talking to him. Given that we were in Vegas, we were hardly in the room but the room was adequate and clean. Enjoyed the free breakfast with the choices of hot (sausage, eggs, country-style potatoes, etc) and cold (cereal, yogurt,etc) breakfast. Will stay again.</p><br>Perfect 4 day stay<p>I was in Las Vegas for a trade show at the Convention Center and my stay at the Residence Inn was pleasant and so VERY convenient! My room was clean, spacious, and I loved having the full kitchen available. Every staff I encountered were friendly and helpful. I will stay again :)</p><br>Great Stay<p>The Residence Inn gave us an opportunity to explore as it was next to the monorail except the noises were a little loud, moving on....the room was pretty nice as it was like a little collection of small houseses. But other than that little one horrible thing I really recommend you visit and it gives you an easygoing all inclusive way to venture throug alas Vegas. One more thing.....have fun in the pool</p><br>Not what their website leads to believe<p>My wife and I, plus one of our staff stayed 5 nights at this hotel in Jan. 2015 for the "Construction Week" trade shows. When I made the reservation, their website did not make it clear that the unit reserved was on floor two, with no elevator.

Since my wife has mobility issues, this was a MAJOR issue.

Their website also did not make it clear that the "loft" bedroom was open to the living area below. I even called the hotel to confirm the "loft" bedroom was separate from the rest of the unit. I was assured it was.

When we checked in, the front desk did not know if the "loft" was totally separated from the rest of the unit.

The loft bedroom WAS NOT separated from the living room/kitchen below.

Additionally, there were problems all week with the car "security" gate. Room card wouldn't work to allow access. Arm was broken off entirely one day, and front desk didn't know it had happened. Made us fee REAL secure...NOT.

You need to specifically request room service, otherwise your room is not serviced on a daily basis.

Breakfast is good. Location to LV Convention Center is good.

Rooms were OK, nothing special.</p><br>Amazing and a quiet location<p>Stayed here with my wife while she was working with the USAF for a month!

Great location, 2 mins from the monorail and just a short walk to midLas Vegas Strip.

Rooms were great with all the amenities required, comfy beds and showers were nice and powerful! Wifi in the room was great!!

Maids cleaned everyday and even did the dishes, we tipped them $10 per week, they do a great job!

Nice and quiet area (except when the Claradon Hotel Came down, haha) just the right area for quiet nights and then travel into the hustle and bustle!

Breakfast was nice, all that's needed really when you get up ready for a busy day!

Every Mon, Tue and Wed they put food on and the Cookies are AMAZING!!</p><br>Frequent Visits<p>Hotel is very convenient to the convention center and off the beaten track and traffic of the strip. Couple of things to note: (1) there is no workout facility on the premises--you must walk next door to Courtyard, be buzzed in and use theirs--I didn't care for this process. (2) 1/2 the hotel neighbors the Courtyard and thus their parking--which you cannot access so the distance for carrying bags can be quite long (3) parking can be very limited during rodeo conventions as the horse trailers are on the property.</p><br>Great all around!<p>I wanted to take the time to give a great compliment to Ramiro for an oust and information customer service. Great attitude. Great first impression. Great personality. Super quick in checking my family in and checking my family out. Ramiro made me feel comfortable and made my family feel at ease. Ramiro and the lost and found team helped me find a samsung charger since my husband and son had to drive from Utah to Vegas and they had all the electronics. They saved me because I rely a lot on my phone to contact people and get from point A to point B. We were there for a soccer tournament the vibe was amazing from start to finish. My daughter's soccer team did not advance and because we did not know if they were going to advance hotel bookings can sometime be chaotic and the rates locked in if you did not call by a certain. In this case it was not. I called the night before and Susan helped me change my departure date. She told me not a problem of course me making sure the information was correct that I was not going to charge an extra night for leaving early I called back Susan addressed me by my last name and said, "Did you miss me already?" It made the conversation and asking questions much easier. Susan reiterated to me that we would be only charged 2 nights. Got the bill the very next morning and I was charged the 2 nights only. Checkout was easy and quick. Called over the phone and it was my main guy Ramiro who checked me out and invited us to come out to breakfast before taking off to the soccer fields for our last game before heading back to Utah. This is an amazing facility and amazing place for family. This is a great group of staff to help you through your day. Thank You Again Ramiro and Susan.</p><br></body></html>
