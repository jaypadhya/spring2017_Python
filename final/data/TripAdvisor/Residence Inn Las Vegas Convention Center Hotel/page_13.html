<html><head><h3>Residence Inn Las Vegas Convention Center Hotel Reviews Page 13</h3></head><body><br>Perfect for stay in LV<p>This is the perfect hotel to stay in Las Vegas. All Res Inn Marriott hotels comes with a full kitchen and they also serve full breakfast. Due to the Independence day long weekend, the hotel is full and had to stand in long line for breakfast. We cannot afford to sit outside as it was burning hot. The hotel could have made some arrangements atleast during summer. Besides, this hotel is just a minute away from the Convention center Monorail station.. Buy a 24 hr pass and you can hop on and off..</p><br>Sweet, business-oriented, perfection.<p>I arrived much earlier than originally planned, and was allowed to check in early. The room was big and so comfortable with a recharging station for my gear. The kitchenette and bath were clean, and the bed just cozy. Being able to make my own meals in the room was great, as was storing the inevitable take-away in the fridge. Free high-speed internet is a huge plus! Free breakfast gets you out the door to the LV Convention Center - and it's convenient to both the north and south halls.

No party-people drama, no wandering drunks, and after 10 hour shifts in a convention booth, this felt like paradise.
Room Tip: Rooms to the back are more likely to be available for early check in.

Great two story layout for accommodation and very quiet.

Nice pool area and functional gym.

We left several items in wardrobe and the staff kindly arranged shipping back to UK which was really appreciated.

Breakfast was basic but functional.</p><br>Great!! Especially for the Convention Center<p>We were in Vegas for a convention (right across the street) and this place was perfect. Great free breakfast in the morning, We did not rent a car and did not need to. We went to the strip in the evenings and took the monorail, again located directly across the street. We even walked one night. They will go to the grocery store for you each day for no charge and this was nice! The rooms have a full kitchen and several bbq grills. They had a laundry facility and nice pool as well. The staff was very helpful!! We had a few personal issues and they went above and beyond to help us with. Great place to stay to get away from the crowd, but close enough to go join the crowd when you wanted! Everything you could need and want!</p><br>Nice quiet family place<p>We stayed a couple nights in a 2 br loft unit. Arrived at 3:30 after a day of traveling (for a 4 pm check in). The room wasn't ready, but the desk staff was very helpful and set us up with a key so we could park and the kids could use the pool until the room was ready. The pool was good sized for a Residence Inn (I find they often have very small pools, but this was quite adequate in size), and they had a few umbrellas so that you could be shaded from the sweltering sun.

The room/suite was beautiful with a living area w/ fireplace and full kitchen. One bedroom is in an open loft on the 2nd floor with its own full bath. The second bedroom was in an open room off the living room, that had folding doors that closed it off from the living room; with a murphy bed and its own full bath. Downside is that neither 'bedroom' is really sound proof from the living room. Upside is that its quite spacious. The living room sofa had a fold out bed, which was worse than aweful. We usually take the mattress off the fold-out and put it on the floor (avoid the whole bar-in-the-back thing, you know), but this mattress wasn't even usable on the floor - you could feel every spring. We ended up sleeping 3 of us in one queen and 2 in the other. The room was very quiet with the exception of the water pipes (they must not have insulated them or something); you could hear when anyone in the building ran the water during the night. Aside from that, we didn't hear a sound all night.

The facility is beautiful w/ actual grass/lawn, (a nice change in Vegas) - small courtyard type arrangements with pretty 2 story buildings. The free breakfast was good, and something of a rarity in LV. Location makes it easy to drive to the strip, or to other restaurants/stores, etc on the east side of town. Convention center is right across the street. LV is pretty easy to navigate by car. There is a Target and Albertson's grocery not far out on Tropicana (one of the major crossroads) or they have a service where they will stock your fridge for you. We had internet issues while we were there, but they put my husband through to corporate IT and were very good with followup, etc. They had it fixed by the morning with left, but at least they were working on the problem and not ignoring it.

Overall the place feels very calming in serene in a city that is anything but. It provided a great place to relax away from the bustle of the strip, and was a great place to stay with the kids.</p><br>An oasis in the midst of Las Vegas!<p>This Residence Inn was our home for eight days and proved to be the BEST choice we could have made from the hundreds of hotels in Las Vegas. This location was easy to access the Strip, the airport, and the highways. From the moment that Beto, the front desk clerk, checked us in, we knew we had made the perfect choice. For one thing, in the midst of a desert area, this Residence Inn has beautifully manicured lawns with soft grass and shade trees. The units are very comfortable with FULL kitchens, living room, bedroom, and ultra clean bathrooms.
This hotel has the ONLY 24/7 swimming pool and hot tub that I've seen. Provided guests do not get loud, they allow all night swimming. Pool towels are provided. Off from the pool area, is a half court basketball court with a high fence and a sitting patio. It also has a BBQ grill about twenty feet outside of the pool area. The fitness center is located next door at the Courtyard. The front desk will give you an access card, but be warned, it is a very small fitness center.
The hotel is across the street from the visitors center and the convention center which has a monorail system that for $18 per day will take visitors to the strip and back as often as you wish.
The breakfast is good with waffles, hot potatoes, eggs, toast, bagels, but the only fresh fruit was bananas. Managers evening get togethers happen 2 to 3 times per week in the breakfast area around 6:pm and have free food and/or drinks.
The laundry center is adjacent to the pool and costs $1.50 per wash and a $1.50 per dry. You can hop in the pool and keep an eye on the laundry at the same time.
SAFETY: An added feature is gated parking areas that only can be accessed with a hotel card. (However, you should still maintain an awareness of your surroundings no matter where you are!)
Would I go back to Las Vegas? ONLY if I could stay at this place! No smokey casino lobbies. No hordes of tourists. No Strip craziness! This place was an oasis for us.
Room Tip: We were in building 5 first floor, suite 513. This room was great. It was near the pool and breakfas...

Convenient location right by the strip without the traffic and noise. This was a welcome motel of quality and quiet, Very restorative and exceeded my expectations of it!
I will definitely recommend it to my friends (especially those who travel with wife & kids), great place!</p><br>An apartment while on business<p>Just a short cab ride from McCarren airport in Vegas and you are met with a very friendly and accommodating staff at the front desk with smiles.
My room was similar to that of an apartment with a spacious sitting area with a modern flat screen, full kitchen, work desk for my laptop and a comfy bed. There is ample closet space and a nice dressing area.
During the week the manager has get togethers for all guest and the theme varies. You really don't have to go out to dinner and beer and wine are included as part of your guest stay. In the morning, full breakfast is also included with your stay.
My business with at the convention center and with that being said, directly across the street, a very , very short stroll.</p><br>No Casino<p>This was a very nice hotel, however, it has no casino. It is right beside the convention center which is a plus if you are there for a convention and it is right beside the end of the monorail. The room was great except unless you want a lock on your bathroom door. There is a sliding door which kept slightly opening. I tend to like traditional doors with locks, especially since someone from the hotel walked in unannounced! They did apologize and luckily I was just in the living area watching TV. I probably would not choose to stay here again unless I needed to be at the convention center everyday.</p><br>Family friendly alternative to a casino<p>This would be a nice place to stay if you do not want to have the glitz of the casinos and other big hotels in Las Vegas. It appears to be family friendly with a barbecue, guest laundry and pool. The suites are in buildings separate from the main lobby, about 8 suites per building. The location is directly across the street from the convention center.

The rooms are nice and typical of most suite type hotels. It included free internet, buffet breakfast and a light buffet dinner. No slots or casino in the lobby which might be good for a family stay. I prefer something a bit nicer and will stay elsewhere when returning.</p><br></body></html>
