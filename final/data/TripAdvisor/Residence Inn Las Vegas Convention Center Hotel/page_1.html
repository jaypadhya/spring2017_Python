<html><head><h3>Residence Inn Las Vegas Convention Center Hotel Reviews Page 1</h3></head><body><br>They treat you like family<p>I can't say enough good things about this place. Everything was perfect! The staff is outstanding! They all go above and beyond anything I would have expected. We're thrilled to have been their guests and we can't wait till we can stay again!</p><br>Convenient Hotel Right Across the LV Convention Center<p>Well, well, well...If you are looking for a convenient hotel right across the Las Vegas Convention Center, this hotel is it. You can literally walk across the street into the South Hall parking lot and you are there. Obviously you still have to walk through the parking lot area and into the Convention Center but you can't get any closer unless you sleep in the parking lot.

Besides the great location, it is a nice clean and friendly hotel. There is a basketball court here and a pool so it's a nice amenity for guests. Not all hotels I have been to have a basketball court so if you like to decompress after a long day at the convention center with a pick up ball game, this place is for you. The room was decent and it was comfortable. You don't feel cramped and you don't have issues of people walking through the hallway during the late night hours and being loud. Each "cottage" has for 4 rooms on the front and looks like 2 or 4 rooms on the opposite end. This location is set up like a condo or modern apartment complex which is spacious. Parking is ample and there was no challenges of finding a parking space near my room.

The only draw back was the internet which when I tried to connect it gave me an error message but my device still connected. The only other issue is the physical location which if you have a car, you have to go right when you exit the property and make a u-turn if you want to go left on Paradise Rd. There is no adjacent restaurant where you can walk over to and eat lunch or catch dinner. This Residence Inn does offer a decent breakfast but it only goes till 9:30am. I am surprised it doesn't go till 10am or 10:30am on Saturday or Sunday mornings. If you want to catch the complementary breakfast you have to get up early or you will miss the whole thing!

Overall, there are more pluses then minuses so I highly recommend it if you want to be near the convention center and the monorail.
Room Tip: Desert Inn Rd will not get you to the strip! You will drive right over it and it will take you away...

Very much enjoyed the happy hour which includes free drinks and food from 5-730.</p><br>Clean, Attentive Staff &amp; Great Location<p>We stay at many Residence Inn's because of the room comfort, full kitchen and complimentary breakfast; and in today’s world, we like to travel on a budget, in all these standards they hit high marks. But the additional benefits of location were that: 1- It was not on the "strip" so it was quiet, 2_ Bus and Monorail station is right around the corner and we could take the SDX (strip) bus as many times we wanted and hop on and off at different locations, for sightseeing, food and drinks, 3- it is mid-point between the "strip" and the famous Fremont Experience to the North which is something else!!! (if you don't like crowds go to Fremont late afternoon or very early evening and then you can leave when it’s too crowded; great early bird dinners offers)... and finally if you don't want to cook in your room, order GrubHub or take the bus/taxi to dinner, 4- Marriott Courtyard is right next door and they have the great concept of "The Bistro" with good meals offers, nice bar, wins, etc. …. and did I mention, the staff was VERY attentive to our needs and requests…</p><br>Decent Property, Excellent Staff<p>I recently stayed here on business. The property is spread across several building clusters. The rooms were large and comfortable. My assigned room had just a slight odor to it. I notified Susan at the front desk and right away she took care of it by sending over an ionized unit to remove the air. It worked like a charm and the rest of my stay, it smelled fresh and clean. She even followed up to make sure everything was acceptable. Susan was excellent and helped make my stay more pleasant. The only drawback was the work out facility which you had to go next door to the Courtyard. Other than that, it was fine for business travel. Would stay there again.</p><br>Nice Property; Good People<p>I go to Las Vegas every year for a conference and normally stay at the Wynn, Encore or Palazzo. I find them unrelentingly noisy, smoky and generally unwelcoming. I’ve been a Marriott fan for a very long time and after 11 years of The Strip hotels, I decided to stop torturing myself and stay at the casino-less, smoke-free Marriott. What a good decision that was.

When I arrived II was given a room too far away from the Gatehouse for my liking as I knew I would be arriving back well after dark in the evenings.. I called the front desk and asked if they could move me closer. Jessica who had checked me in understood immediately and said that the next day there would be rooms available around noon. She told me she would be there from 8:00 a.m. and would call me as soon as a suitable room was available which she did and I was given a room in a perfect location. While Jessica stands out among the staff, everyone I encountered had a smile and a “Good Morning” at the ready. In Vegas!!!

The rooms are clean and comfortable with windows that open onto trees and lawns and singing birds. In Vegas!!! Kitchen has everyting necessary to make a meal -except the food ;)

Full breakfast buffet and internet are provided free of charge. In Vegas!!!</p><br>Wonderful front desk experience!<p>I staggered in late at night, tired from my flights, and Susan G. at the front desk was a warm, caring, positive shot of Welcome! And she even remembered my name every night after that. In fact, she remembered the names of all the people coming in and out. I travel all the time and Marriott should take of Susan G!
Room Tip: This is close to Convention Center and that is why I chose it. It is not a tourists hotel.

Unacceptable in my opinion, as even the Hampton Inns have this. Marriott has slipped to the lower end of service and acceptance. This hotel was not chosen by me, but as part of a tour. I would not choose it personally</p><br>Hidden Gem in the Desert<p>We stayed here for our business at the Mr Olympia Expo and this hotel is wonderful. The staff is attentive and very accomidating, and the rooms are large and can stay 6 people easily without much trouble, as there are 3 large beds in each. Some rooms are 2 stories and have a full kitchen and even a fireplace.

My favorite part of this place is the layout. Its not a huge extravigant building, but honestly that is what makes it the most charming. For a huge city like Vegas to have land like this available to the public is exellent. The coutyard between the rooms is home to paved walkways among trees and is definitely the kind of nature you don't expect much. I hope this place stays this way for a long long time, and doesn't build up to some large multi story building like the rest.</p><br>Was here for a conference<p>Pretty much all of the Marriott brands in Las Vegas near the strip are walking distance to the convention center. I was there for 5 days for a conference. I chose the RI over other close by Marriott brands because it serves hot breakfast. The lobby and the dining area are small. Keep in mind that these Marriott hotels close to the convention center are all non-gaming which is what I prefer. I mean if I want noise, I can always take a cab or monorail to get to the strip. There's also the old Las Vegas Hilton right next to the Convention Center if do not want to take a ride for some fun. There are a couple of nice restaurants within walking distance too in addition to the old Las Vegas Hilton. I had a nice suite and the staff is very accommodating. I mean from the front desk, to the dining area, to housekeepers, and grounds keepers are all very nice. The only thing is that I was next to a family of I don't know how many kids that keeps slamming the door over and over again and the some kids keeps getting locked out and banging on the door. When I asked the front desk when are they leaving, he told me the next day. That was definitely not the case. I think they were only giving 2 keys and did not want the front desk to know that they piled on 6 kids in the room and made several trips to and from the breakfast to bring food back. I can also hear the noises from next door as well. Other than that experience, it was fine. The SuperShuttle goes to all the convention hotels too which is quite convenient. I would stay here again except next time I would ask, who is next to me for the next few nights.
Room Tip: Always ask who your neighbors are.
