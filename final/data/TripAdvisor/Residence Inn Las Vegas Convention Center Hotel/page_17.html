<html><head><h3>Residence Inn Las Vegas Convention Center Hotel Reviews Page 17</h3></head><body><br>Nice Property for short or long stays<p>Ive stayed here a few times over the last year. My only complaint is when you book through a 3rd party (priceline etc) you get a lower level of service such as no early check in, which was offered when paying full rate. (verified room avails that date so they were not sold out the night prior or on the check in datesl saw other customers get in early as well) Youre actually doing a property a favor by filling unused perishable rooms. An empty room is zero revenue. AND it creates ill will on full pay stays and , clearly by this review, ill thoughts about the property. In fact while I like the property Ive filled many room nights and stays at other area hotels.

Rooms are fairly modern. Kitchens stocked with pans and utensils and if its missing something they are usually happy to deliver same. Bathrooms are spacious.

Very nice flat screen tvs with decent channels unlike many properties/ Laundry facility, "room service" local restaurant delivery. Breakfast in the am is provided though I missed it every time. Internet is provided.
Room Tip: avoid main road areas as traffic can be loud

From the Manager Chris who assisted me in setting up a party for my cousin and to the check in and out staff Rachel. I love this place!</p><br>Great place to stay in the middle of craziness<p>This hotel feels like a modest, quiet little oasis of pleasantness in the midst of the concrete, neon and craziness of Las Vegas (this is, of course, assuming you don't enjoy the culture of The Strip). Comfortable and visually attractive accommodations, helpful desk workers, excellent breakfast, and even some green grass down the middle of the complex as you walk to your suite. No blinking, noisy machines in the lobby. There is cable internet there, but wireless only at the front desk building. The convention center is right across the street, along with a monorail station, should you wish to travel to the strip. Not great for restaurant choices right nearby. My only suggestions would be that they provide wireless to the rooms, and keep the coffee station going all day after the breakfast service shuts down.
Room Tip: Suites upstairs, looking in on the green, are very pleasant.

It is the same today as it was then. The same old tv's the same old furniture and the same old carpet.

The fitness room is an antique and the tread mills the old ones with the crowns in the miiddle they are truly dangerous.

The property is a disgrace and Marriott should be ashamed to have their name on it.</p><br>Nice and quiet but not that close to the strip<p>We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights and since we were traveling with my son we enjoyed having the two bedrooms, living room and kitchen. (Which is why we chose the residence inn, as we often do on vacation.) The grounds are nice, the staff helpful, and the breakfast decent and well stocked. We had a car which gave us the flexibility we needed but if someone is there without a car you need to be aware that it is quite a distance from the strip. The Monorail is across the street but it is fairly secluded from the hotel (at least when we were and when you get off the monorail you are behind the hotels.</p><br>Home away from home<p>This property is located directly across the street from the Las Vegas convention center. It is IDEAL for anyone attending a conference or even there! It's much closer than any other hotel (except the Hilton). The full hot breakfast was well maintained every morning, despite a fully sold out hotel. The nightly managers reception service was friendly. Not as elaborate as other hotel receptions, but a terrific value. Having a kitchen was nice for leftover dinners. The carpet in my room could use updating, but the TV was new. And free internet made this a bargain! I would DEFINITELY recommend this hotel and would return if attending another conference.</p><br>Great location<p>We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights, it has a great location right off of the strip. There were plenty of options for Resturants nearby and within walking distance of the monorail. I would stay here again.</p><br>Great location yet quiet like a "normal" non-Vegas hotel<p>Our family had to stay in Vegas for schedule reasons on our way to Utah but didn't really want to be there. This place was a pleasant surprise. We could barely tell we were in Vegas. The hotel has a lot of property and is surrounded by a gated parking lot. It was surprisingly quiet. The outdoor pool was great, and we also made use of the fitness center at their other property next door. My daughter and I enjoyed their sport court (i.e., baskeball hoop). Room was clean and comfortable. My one complaint was that the sofa bed mattress was unbearable, like sleeping on paper-covered springs (had to sleep on the couch instead); we mentioned this when leaving and they said they'd been getting several complaints with those new mattresses. Staff was friendly. Breakfast was plentiful and good. The guests didn't seem like the typical Vegas crowd. And for people who actually WANT to be in Vegas, the location is quite good, you can catch the monorail that runs from the convention center to a bunch of hotels.</p><br>PERFECT QUIET PLACE OFF THE STRIP<p>I really didn't want to stay on The Strip on my recent visit to Vegas. I was happy to find this Residence Inn very close to the Strip (very close!), yet much quieter and no hassle of parking (lots of free parking here).

When I checked in, the front desk girl was soooo nice! First of all, she upgraded me to a 2 bedroom suite (a bottom floor bedroom and an upper floor bedroom / loft) with 2 complete bathrooms! I loved the room. She also provided me with a ton of information on Las Vegas, including where to go for free parking, etc. (a lot of the casinos want you to come in and offer free parking garages - don't ever pay to park in Vegas!). I appreciated all the information.

The grounds are magnificent. You can see by my photographs the manicured grounds. There's a common garden area with benches, and a barbeque grill. There's also a fabulous pool and there was a hot tub right outside my room. The hotel is very big, with several buildings. It is more like an apartment complex than a hotel.

The rooms are fully equipped with everything - including fast Internet (it's not wi-fi). I had 2 TVs, a living room, full kitchen, and the 2 bathrooms and 2 bedrooms. It was very clean, and the bed was extremely comfortable - standard excellent Marriott quality.

After a night on the Strip, I was glad I picked a hotel away from it. It's noisy and crowded on the Strip and I don't particularly care for all those very high-rise hotels. My choice could not have been more perfect.

The breakfast in the morning is the icing on the cake. It was a delicious full breakfast bar in a sunny, large room over by the pool area - couldn't be better.

Also, not that I cared, but this hotel is located right next to the convention center. It is also only a few steps away from a little metro-rail public transportation thing - if you choose not to drive around the Strip.

As great as this hotel was, the best thing about it was the staff. All fantastic! I reallly enjoyed my stay here. Oh, and the perfect Las Vegas weather didn't hurt!

And the price - very reasonable for Vegas. No complaints there.

p.s. If it sounds like I own stock in Marriott, I can assure you I don't - I am just really lucky with them. I'll rate a Best Western next just to show I am not biased!! :)
Room Tip: Opt for the 2 bedroom - it's great!
