<html><head><h3>Residence Inn Las Vegas Convention Center Hotel Reviews Page 2</h3></head><body><br>Typical Residence Inn, spacious with Kitchenettes. Clean and very good. Definitely recommended.<p>With 3 families and kids, this was a great place and roomy enough. Kitchenettes are useful when on the road and being veggie where you can cook your own food in a spacious kitchen as well. Nice beds and location is great and not that far from the main attractions. Rooms can sleep up to 6 if 2 are not fussed about sofa bed. I would definitely stay at any Residence Inn by Marriot. They are worth every penny.</p><br>Horrible hotel<p>Had a horrible experience at this hotel our room was up 2 flights of stairs with no elevator so we had to carry all of our luggage and everything up all those stairs in 114 degree weather and once we got in the room the AC did not work well enough to cool the room off. It was hotter in our room then it was outside and that was after letting the AC run full blast for 3 hours. We promptly packed all of our things up carried them back down the two flights of stairs into the car and checked out of the hotel immediately and went to another nearby. I will never stay here and would not recommend it to anyone. I would really like to give this Hotel no stars but its will not let me so I must give it 1 but I wish it was 0.</p><br>Disappointed!<p>We rented a loft and after 3 hours and 2 "engineers" later the room temp was 85. Perhaps it was just that room so we had them turn the ac on in another loft and after an hour not much difference. The outlet in the upstairs bedroom did not work. We were very much looking forward to staying there but couldn't due to the hot temp of the loft. Total waste of time.</p><br>Love this place (each time)!!<p>We stayed here last year for the ASD show at the Las Vegas Convention Center. We decided it was so great we would stay again for six nights. The room is a typical Residence Inn room. Queen bed, living room, full kitchen, full bathroom, plenty of closet space....
We had just returned from a trip to Zion and Bryce Canyon. Since we stayed here last year we were able to reserved the same room this year. We checked in and went grocery shopping. We have lunch and dinner in while we are here. We took advantage of the kitchen and the outdoor shared grill. We only spent $120 for lunches and dinners. Breakfast is served daily. Choices from waffles, biscuits and gravy, scrambled eggs, sausage, Canadian bacon, cereal, toast, yogurt.... plenty of options for everyone.
I was able to use the workout facility at the Courtyard by Marriott next door by showing my room key. There are laundry facilities onsite for $1.50 for the washer and $1.25 for the dryer. I washed my clothes as soon as I arrived and just before we left. Very convenient
If we come back next year we will choose the Residence Inn again!! The staff is friendly and helpful!! Thank you!!</p><br>It was so so<p>Disappointing for a marriott property. Asked for something close by because we had no vehicle and we just finished the 6 day river trip in the canyon and we were exhausted and did not want to lug our heavy bags but they could not accommodate and we got the furthest away.
Forget about trying to get a taxi to the strip. There were soooo many waiting. They did not check my marriott profile for my preferences. There was no alcohol to buy. Gave some silly excuse about free happy hour Monday Tuesday and Wednesday (it was Sunday in Vegas).
Pool looked nice. The bedding was great.
We were not offered water and there was none for sale.
Breakfast was ok.</p><br>Excellent stay<p>We stayed at this property for 5 days along with the kids. It was very good and we truly enjoyed our stay and felt that it lived up to the Marriot standards. Staff was very nice and professional. The service was impressive and they were willing to accommodate our needs during our stay over there and it was worth mentioning. The check-in experience was smooth with friendly staff. Offered wide variety of Breakfast items and the service was really good. It has an outdoor pool and we barely used it as the day time temperatures were well above 100 degrees.
Parking was nice with lots of spaces, with secure entrance.
The only glitch that we had was with the internet as it was down for almost 2 days with some equipment issues. However, we were offered to use internet from the Courtyard's lobby next door, which was a bit inconvenient.
Barring that, it was a nice stay and I recommend this property.</p><br>Great Hotel, Super Friendly Staff, Beautiful Rooms!<p>We stayed here for 2 night while passing through on our road trip. The gentleman at the front desk was super friendly and helpful. The room was beautiful, spacious and clean and the bed was very comfortable. Breakfast was good. Would definitely recommend and we will absolutely stay here again!</p><br>Home away from home!!!<p>I stayed with some family members And my boyfriend . My nephew had never been to Las Vegas so I wanted him to experience it and see it in a kids way. We really liked the atmosphere . It was just like being at home. The breakfast was good. We were able to barbecue and enjoy the sun in the pool. Overall, it was a great experience and will be back soon.</p><br>Great place to stay<p>This was a great property! Customer service was phenomenal and room layout was convenient as well. Ramiro checked us in promptly and had a room even though we were early! He was very friendly and when we called for some extra shampoo in the room it was promptly delivered. This is definitely a great place to stay if you dont want to be right on the strip with the people but still enjoy the sights.

Did not get to experience bfast and wifi was a bit of a hassle during the trip though. other than that it was great!</p><br>Convenient location and friendly place<p>My first time at this location and felt very comfortable staying there. From day one, I was greeted by Susan with a big and friendly smile even though it was kind of late. I stayed there for 4 nights to attend a conference in town and had some fun in the evening. Susan was always helpful and friendly whenever I needed a direction, local info, taxi, etc. The staff was friendly when I saw them during breakfast and occasionally in the evening.
Room Tip: it seems all rooms were good.
