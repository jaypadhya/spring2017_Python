<html><head><h3>Residence Inn Las Vegas Convention Center Hotel Reviews Page 14</h3></head><body><br>Nice treat off the strip<p>We prefer to stay at Marriott properties because we know what to expect. This hotel has been updated since outlast visit. The lobby and bar area are much more user friendly. There are two eateries as well as a snack bar type place all in the main lobby area. Bistro 55 the bar, has a nice variety of menu selections. The Envy restaurant is a bit more upscale for dinner and also serves breakfast.
Our room was nicely decorated and pretty quiet considering it was street side. We like the location because it is just a few minutes to board the Monorail and go either direction. Convenience is key when in Las Vegas.
Room Tip: They could have better pillows in both our opinions. The non feather pillows were terrible, all 8 of...

Since I'm Marriott Platinum I was looking at all the Marriott properties around the convention (there are a lot), but trust me - just get whatever is cheapest! You'll have the best of all worlds either way. We were just fine with the Residence and actually scored a free upgrade into a 2-floor suite - with 2 full baths!!!! That was the best part, because we didn't have to wake up earlier to stagger showers. Up to Marriott standards on cleanliness and amenities. The breakfast spread was actually much bigger than I thought it would, with 2 hot plates and a waffle station. The nightly dinner spread also included Bud Light on tap, which was the first time I'd seen that!

But why I say just get the cheapest is because all the Marriott properties are all concentrated on the one block, super easy to walk to. So we used the Courtyard's workout room, and bought booze from their market in the lobby. Also, we walked over the signature Marriott to eat dinner one night when we didn't feel like going too far. Getting delivery is also easy at the Residence because you're in separate buildings (like an apartment complex).

The only reason I've docked one dot is because the way that it's situated on the street makes it a bit convoluted for cabs to in and out of there. It's a one way turn in, so the few times we went out to the strip I think it cost us an extra few dollars every time because they had to do this back track, U-turn maneuver. Also, some may see this as a downside (though I think it's a plus because I was there to work) that there are no slots or games in any Marriott properties. This means that you'll have a much more relaxing stay than you'd get at any other hotel, but then you're that much farther away from the fun. All in how you look at it.

Lastly, no one has believed me but the coworker that was in the room with me and sat on it for himself... but that was one of the most comfortable beds ever. I know, I know, it's just a Residence or whatever but trust me this bed was fluffier and lovelier than any bed I'd been on in awhile. No idea why it ended up on the second floor of a suite in the Residence. The 4 feather, oversized pillows helped too. Will totally try to score a room here for my next Vegas convention, especially if we can get under $100 a night again!</p><br>Good place to stay<p>I didn't realize when I was checking in that there weren't elevators. So be mindful of that if you have a lot of luggage with you. The room was clean and very nice. Everything from the couch to the appliances looked fairly new. My only gripe with the room itself was the location of the light switches. The switch for the vanity is in the main area of the room near the bed. The switch for the toilet/shower area is outside the door to that room next to the sink. This is a little annoying, even after a week. I was in room 1521. It was very difficult to find. The sign on that particular building was not correct. Talking to other guests, they also had trouble finding their rooms. The sun also lights up the room during sunrise even with the curtains closed. The location is great if you're working/going to the convention center as it is right across the street. The Strip can be a little bit of a hike though and the surrounding area behind the hotel is a little shady. As other reviewers have said a gate at the back of the property would be great. The fitness center is located next door at the Courtyard by Marriot. Very small. Honestly I felt slightly claustrophobic in there. The complimentary breakfast had a good variety of food. The entire staff was courteous and helpful. Overall I would stay there again. Though I would prefer a hotel on the strip if I was going to spend a lot of time there.</p><br>Nice Place but Very Expensive and Run Down<p>Very nice rooms. A bit outdated but great. For the Vegas standards it is very, very, very expensive.
Breakfast is great when not crowded with a bunch of kids running around and tripping your plate around.
Please put a gate at the other end of the property (towards the strip).
A gate with a card entrance would be great. Had to walk an additional mile to get around the property to get to the strip.
That really sucked. Need to try to take care of your customers!
Will go somewhere else in October for the next show.
Room Tip: Great for Conventions but way too expensive!
See more room tips</p><br>Such a big relief in Las Vegas<p>Any traveler will tell you that when he/she enters a hotel to check in, he will not be in the best of moods. So, it is extremely annoying if one has to drag your bags through the clamor and irritation of a sea of slot machines. So, right there, a regular hotel without slot machines in the lobby scores high in Vegas.

Residence Inn is great because of the suites. For me this was most convenient because it is located right across the street from the convention center where I had registered for a conference.

One big problem with this chain of hotels is that there are no elevators and the suites are quite spread apart. So, if you are with heavy luggage, you will hate it. I was given a suite on the first floor. I really wish the front desk people take into consideration the luggage a guest is carrying, before assigning suites.

Overall, this is a great hotel and all basic amenities work well.</p><br>One of the better Residence Inns we've stayed at.<p>Very nice property, conveniently located. The room was clean and comfortable. The breakfast was very good and we didn't feel rushed like we often do at cattle call breakfasts. The employees even came around to see if we wanted anything else as it was shutting down...nice touch.</p><br>Just average<p>Beds were neither comfortable or uncomfortable. Convieneint walk to Convention Center, nice place for kids since there is no gambling, but not so nice because you have a pull out couch for a second bed. Typical Marriott with $3 water and $1.50 for some week old fruit. It was nice they did not charge for parking (but most hotels in Vegas do not). No resort fee also nice</p><br>Time for an update<p>Likely the oldest Residence Inn I have every stayed out and it showed. Looks like an old time share. It is spread out over a large area so you have to walk to your unit outside. Rooms are nice and the kitchens are great. The only thing going for it is location if you plan to spend your time at the convention center. Does not feel like it is in Las Vegas.
Room Tip: first floor so you do not have to carry your luggage upstairs.
See more room tips</p><br>Consistently good<p>I have been using this hotel for my CES travel for the last 10 years. Although they triple the room prices during CES (because they can), it's the perfect place to stay if your business is on the main floor of the Convention Center, and we have used our suite ($400-$500/night) as our primary location to meet customers for all those years.

The property as a whole is a tiny bit worn, but they have been upgrading the room furnishings, televisions, etc. (when you have the same room year after year, you can tell). The primary reason I don't give an "Excellent" review is that their internet service sucks. You can get your email, but slow connection is a major impediment to doing sophisticated CES demos in the suite (depending on your needs).

Breakfast is great, and the breakfast room is another great place to meet with customers/partners throughout the day.

Tips for CES/conventions:
* they take reservations a year in advance directly at the front desk
* if you want to use your room as a hospitality suite, request a room "close to the front of the property, facing the pool/garden" (you build up seniority with repeated stays, and your room location will improve)
* to save money, rearrange the furniture yourself, but make a drawing before you start so you can get everything back to where it goes
* bring a small vacuum cleaner so that you can spot clean yourself, then leave the "Do Not Disturb" sign on the room throughout your stay so your back-to-back meetings all day long don't get interrupted
* bring a banner and zip ties to attach to your railing (daily fee) to help people find you
* take a trip to Safeway to stock your refrigerator with drinks and snacks for your guests
* we used Capriotti's and Jimmy John's for daily sandwich runs for staff & guests</p><br>Needs a make over<p>Location is convenient to the strip and plenty of places to eat. Rooms look like Ethan Allen design from 1950. Breakfast is included but does not begin until 7a on the weekends. Location is quiet with no casino.</p><br></body></html>
