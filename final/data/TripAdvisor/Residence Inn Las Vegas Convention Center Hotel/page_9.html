<html><head><h3>Residence Inn Las Vegas Convention Center Hotel Reviews Page 9</h3></head><body><br>Disappointed<p>My husband and two kids (21 months and 6 months) stayed here over the weekend (8/8/14-8/10/14). My husband, who is a pilot, had a trip so me and the kids decided to drive from San Diego to meet him. My husband has stayed here in the past and figured it would be a good place to stay with the kids since we would have a full kitchen. Plus we LOVE Marriotts (lifetime Platinum).We booked the 2 bedroom bi-level loft. My husband stayed in one in Kansas City. When we arrived we were very disappointed that the "2 rooms" were actually a Queen size bed in the loft and a sofa bed. Other Residence Inns that we stayed in have a King size bed in the downstairs room and a queen size bed in the loft. The springs on the mattress on the sofa bed were so bad we had to layer towels to keep the springs from poking us. I wish we would have done alittle more research prior to booking. There are no ice machines at this property (as far as we know). You had to use the refridgerator ice makers. Don't mind doing that, but we didn't get much ice. All night we were woken up by the water filling the ice tray and the cubes dropping. For the noise it made you would have thought we would have plenty of ice. The last thing was the pool - yuck! There was tons of hair and debris floating on top and more on the bottom. There was even a baby lizard floating : ( I would guess the pool hadn't been cleaned for weeks. For the size of the property it should be serviced every morning. On a bright note the front desk staff was fabulous. They were extremely helpful on what we could do with kids. I think the next time we will stay at the Marriott Grand Chateau. Worth the extra cost.
Room Tip: Ask when booking the 2 room bi-level loft if one of the beds is a pull out.

This room had a Queen bed, Queen pull out sofa, comfy chair, coffee table, LED TV, full kitchen, desk. two bi-fold closets and full bathroom. There was plenty of room. The room was really clean and in great condition. There was a courtyard with a full size grill and a separate area with picnic tables for dining. There is free Wi-Fi available. Also, for an additional charge you can get hi-speed Wi-Fi as well.
This location serves a breakfast buffet daily with a lot of rotating choices daily. There is also a cocktail hour a few days a week - check the property website or the schedule on your fridge. Food was fresh, hot and delicious.
The pool was cleaned every day and was not too busy.
This location is so convenient to the Convention Center (across the street) and is about a 7 minute walk to the building. The monorail is about a 4 minute walk.
We had a wonderful visit. The entire staff at the Residence Inn was so helpful the entire visit.
If we come back for a convention - we will definitely stay there!!
Room Tip: Buildings 1, 2, 3 and 4 are close to the pool and breakfast.

I've stayed there twice in the past week and both times I had to change rooms because the first room they gave me reeked of smoke (the second room, both times, was musty and also smelled of smoke). There is only one chair in the kitchen, the rooms are not well cleaned, the bed is uncomfortable, and the A/C is loud and inconsistent. The breakfast is more limited than what you usually find at a Residence Inn (they ran out of bagels by 8:00 Sunday morning). Really just run down and poorly managed. Very disappointing.
Room Tip: Check your room first to make sure it doesn't stink from smoke.
See more room tips</p><br>Excellent Service<p>We stayed here for 2 weeks as we had to be at the Convention Centre most days, and it was a quick ride on the monorail ( walkable, but not in that heat!). We were so pleased with this decision, as we had Wi-Fi and breakfast included, and also peace, quiet and respite from those slot machines. The room was great - and cleaned every day. Any issues were dealt with immediately, and the service was truly excellent - especially the front desk staff who were extremely helpful.</p><br>Great place off the beaten path<p>If you've stayed in a Residence Inn anywhere you know the setup. All suites with breakfast (and sometimes happy hour) included.

This location is very convenient to the Las Vegas strip yet offers a sea of tranquility from all the craziness. As I was here on business, it was a perfect choice. Room was clean and neat. Completely satisfied with everything. Would have been 5 stars except that this location does not offer a appetizers in the evening.</p><br>A Vegas Apartment<p>I attended a convention in Vegas late June and stayed at the Residence Inn. It had everything a conventioneer would ask for-right across from the convention center, right across from the monorail, and a wonderful place to come home to after a long hot day. We had a great bed, a kitchenette, and an eating/tv watching space right in the middle of a beautiful apartment complex. The breakfast each day was lovely and you couldn't beat the pool on those 111 degree days. last but certainly not least the staff were wonderful-we filled out a grocery ordering card in the morning and, in the afternoon, had all of our favorite food. Would love to stay there again!
Room Tip: they're all good, but we liked NOT staying near the pool
See more room tips</p><br>Quiet enclave in wild Las Vegas<p>Residence Inn Convention Center is a nice alternative to the typical Vegas high rise hotel and offers many conveniences. In my opinion, it is worth it to rent a car to get around Las Vegas, even if it is just to visit the Strip hotels and casinos. Every location except Fremont Street venues offers free parking. The Residence Inn has parking at your door. However, the other advantage is the location across from the Convention Center and monorail, both are an easy walk. It is a longer hike to the LVH Las Vegas Hotel (now the WVS) where many convention activities can also take place, but it is quite do-able, certainly less than ½ of a mile.

I stayed in a Queen Studio with beautiful stainless steel and granite kitchen, including a convenient icemaker in the full refrigerator. There is even a dishwasher. Other units offer fireplaces (it was 113 degrees so that was not appealing) or two full bedrooms. Remember, many of the units are up one flight (I prefer those) but make sure to ask at check-in if you need to stay on the main level; there are no elevators. The hotel is relatively quiet considering the area. I was in the back section which is not particularly scenic but was very quiet.

A superb amenity is the full hot breakfast every morning, it is very extensive. Starts at 6:30 am weekdays, 7:00 am weekends. Free newspapers (USA Today, Wall Street Journal, and Las Vegas paper) are stacked daily by the food area. There is a good-sized pool but it is only 3-5 feet deep (typical of Vegas hotels). I didn’t find the water consistently warm even though it was summer, it depends on the sunshine during the day. The HD television offers a good selection of channels, and some, but not all, are in HD. The wireless internet is excellent for most daily uses, but for those who have streaming or intense needs, you can upgrade to $5.00 a day service. From time to time, it loses the signal for a few minutes, so just hang on, it comes back. There is a nice worktable and executive chair for business activities.

The central cooling unit with thermostat is handy, but unfortunately when the fan and unit kicks on it can be a disturbingly loud roar. It is more effective than the typical in-wall units found at many hotels, but it would be helpful if there was a setting for a lower fan speed or for a continuous fan.

Two other features of note are a guest laundry room, and selected weeknights offer a reception with beer and wine, soft drinks, and light food, like sandwiches and snacks.

This Residence Inn offers real value for a more peaceful stay amid the craziness of Las Vegas. For conventioneers, you cannot find a more convenient location and blend of amenities. For those with a car, it is easy to come and go and the traffic is much lighter in this area, and those without one can cross the street to the monorail.
Room Tip: The rooms directly behind the main building are beautifully tree shaded and are closer to the mornin...

First and foremost you go to a hotel for a place to sleep, and they failed in providing that.

PROS: The location is perfect if you are there for a conference, and good enough if you are on a longer vacation and want to stay away from the strip. The monorail is right across the street if you choose to use it (which I did). It is quiet and the breakfasts are fine, if repetitive. The kitchen is great and there is a grill outside which I saw others use. The place is really clean and the wifi works. This is great value for the price. I really appreciated not having to experience smoke and casino darkness, especially in the mornings.

CONS: The number one problem I had is that the sofabed was a totally worn out mattress with lumps and springs poking everywhere. I was sharing the room with a very inexperienced traveller who would have been very put off by me complaining, which is why I did not demand a room change after midnight (my arrival time). I did leave a note on the complaint form in the room. For parents thinking of staying here, there is no division between the bed area and the sofabed area, so putting kids in one or the other means you will have similar bedtimes. I would not put a child on that sofabed anyway. There is also limited cab traffic to the hotel, so you need to call for them if you don't have a car or the monorail is inconvenient.

In sum, this was perfect for a single or couple who don't want the casino experience 24/7 or for a single at a conference across the street. For those who actually want to use the second place to sleep; go somewhere else.
Room Tip: If you are nervous about personal safety, you might prefer the second floor rooms. If really nervou...
See more room tips</p><br>Good choice<p>I also attended a convention and stayed at the Residence Inn. This was the first time at a Residence Inn and I have to say I was impressed. Because I was lucky enough to drive down, I found a Smiths grocery store a short drive away and bought enough groceries to stock my fridge.

The full kitchen was great (wish they had Saran Wrap for cooking) except the pathetic water pressure in the sink (room 2011). Staff were very pleasant, breakfast buffet was pretty good, except for the canned fruit.

This is a hotel I would stay at again while visiting Las Vegas, especially attending a convention.</p><br>Great Convention Hotel But ...<p>I stayed one night while attending a convention at the Convention Center. The location was great! It's right across the street from the Convention Center. It's also across the street from a Monorail stop so if you want to go to the strip it's just a short ride. My room was super clean and comfy and it had a small balcony, which would have been wonderful had it not been over 100 outside. All of the service I received was excellent. They do not have any covered parking, which can be brutal, but Alex at the front desk clued me in on where to park to keep my car cooler. He was spot on with his tip! My bed was very firm, which I love, and it was very quiet. I slept like the dead. The only downside to this place was the limited menu at the tiny café in the lobby (I had to drive somewhere to find supper) and the fact that I paid $200 - yes, $200 - for one single night. Considering the lack of a real restaurant and the simplicity of the place, this was highway robbery charged only because of its proximity to the Convention Center. But it was important to me to be close to that location. I would stay again if I could get a better deal - a way better deal!</p><br></body></html>
