<html><head><h3>Residence Inn Las Vegas Convention Center Hotel Reviews Page 6</h3></head><body><br>Old style but great service<p>We arrived with a warm greeting from the desk agent. We asked if it was possible to upgrade our room and they gave us exactly what we wanted Bi-level). The room d√©cor is outdated, but clean and comfortable. I don't mind the '70's look since it was clean and roomy. Slept great. Bed was very comfortable. Woke up with a nice breakfast (complimentary) and the breakfast staff were very kind. No qualms about this property. It is also close enough to the strip, but not too close as we did not hear any traffic. No wonder we slept so well. Check in and out were both a breeze. Would definitely stay here again.
Room Tip: In our case, we just asked and got it. Does not hurt to ask for an upgrade.

There is some noise from aircraft taking off if you stay on the 2nd (top) floor. Also, there are no elevators so if you stay on the top floor you will be walking up and down the stairs. Water pressure and temperature in the shower was great. WiFi was decent. The front door to my room which led directly outside did not seal well and you could hear noise and see light through the cracks. I would stay here again if I could get a room on the main level and the price was right. There is no resort fee here.</p><br>Good weekend stay<p>I stayed in this hotel with some friends and I'm definitely pleased. We arrived very late but had no problems checking in, which is always a plus after a long drive. The room was very clean with a bedroom on the second level. Awesome. The only thing that was a bit of an inconvenience was that there isn't much within walking distance. Good place to stay, just don't expect much within a comfortable walking distance.</p><br>Location &amp; Attentive Front Desk Clerk Susan G<p>Great location for both business and pleasure. I came into town to prepare for an upcoming jury trial and the Front Desk clerk, Susan, ensured my room would be tucked away in a quiet upstair suite away from the hustle and bustle of the National Finals Rodeo week. When my trial went longer than the anticipated four days, Susan again helped with my reservation and found the best available rate for the additional three days without having to move to another room or property. The free breakfast was a nice touch each morning. However, I would have preferred a little bit of variety each day. Thank you, Victoria.
Room Tip: Ask Susan the Front Desk Clerk for guidance in this area.

The only problem is the free wi-fi that sometimes really don't work.</p><br>Quiet, Clean and Off Busy Strip<p>Location great, about 15 minute walk to Encore and strip. Close to Convention Center where buses and monorail stop. We had room near back of property, it was very quiet for sleeping except some airplane noise. The room was clean with full kitchen, sofa and queen size bed. The queen size bed was very comfortable, we needed a pad for the sofa bed and it was provided very fast after requesting. Basic buffet breakfast, good coffee. Happy hour beer and wine provided with two suppers per week was good with lots of salad, snack and meat dish. Free Wifi was excellent with no problems. Would stay here again, staff friendly and helpful.
Room Tip: We were on second floor at back of property,very quiet
See more room tips</p><br>Poor Breakfast experience - eat next door at Courtyard for $$<p>We had the same experience as the previous post. We stayed over thanksgiving. The room was great. We slept well, very quiet. However, the hotel is large and the gatehouse/ breakfast area is small - messy and not pleasant. We basically gave up and started eating at the Courtyard next door. The courtyard has a pay cafe with cereals, coffees, hot chocolate, limited selection of pastries, yogurts, etc. It was yummy, but does cost $$. We spent around $30 each morning for 4 of us.

The wifi was also very slow likely due to the large number of people at the hotel. (there were times such as in the morning that were faster).

If you are staying over a busy time and want a free breakfast, you need to stay someplace else.

We did like the location and staff.
Room Tip: For quieter rooms, ask for a room farther from the gatehouse. If you want a shorter walk, ask for o...

Enjoyed the friendly staff, always ready to serve. Breakfast was top notch, the rooms were clean and spacious. Highly recommend staying here if you for your next trip to Vegas.</p><br>Unhappy with this hotel<p>We stayed at this Residence Inn over Thanksgiving 2014. The hotel was clean and in a good location. But we would not recommend this hotel to friends and family. This was the largest Residence Inn we have ever stayed in (we stay at Residence Inns often) and the breakfast area was the smallest we have ever seen, and it was filthy. There was food an napkins all over the floor. As far as we saw not one table was ever cleaned during the designated breakfast times. There was not enough food (basically empty food serving containers) for the amount of people staying at the hotel, and breakfast was basically a free for all. The area was so crowded that we could barely walk or move around it. This was our breakfast experience all three mornings. We were also disappointed because there was only one person ever working the front desk, and again, this is an extremely large facility. The second evening we arrived back at our suite our keys did not work. My adult son returned to the front desk (basically our room was a block from the front desk) and was greeted by an over worked (he called her rude) clerk. She said that there was a problem with our credit card and the front desk had left a message on our room's telephone. My son asked how we were supposed to get the message if we were locked out of the room. We are part of the Marriott Rewards program so they had our cell phone number we wondered why they didn't use that number. My husband quickly went down to the front desk and the clerk realized that the that the error was the hotel's not ours. She did not apologize. There are many,many, rooms available in Las Vegas and we would not recommend this facility. As I mentioned we stay at Residence Inns often and we have never had a problem before.
Room Tip: Again we would not recommend this hotel.
See more room tips</p><br>Great experience<p>This hotel was great - clean, well-managed, wonderfully friendly staff. The hot breakfast got the day off to a great start and the in-room kitchen made relaxing after the day's work easy, as well as allowing me to keep trip costs down. This allowed me to splurge on some of the great shows running in the Strip hotels. The Strip was very easy to get to as the Monorail stop is right across the street. I come to Las Vegas every year or so on business and I am going to make sure that this is where I stay from now on whenever I am in town.
Room Tip: All of the rooms have kitchens. Some of the rooms have fireplaces.
