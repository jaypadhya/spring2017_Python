Place was clean, small swimming pool with small yacussi, airco was little noise.
It takes you about 10 min walk to go to circus circus, sahara, riviera or a little bit longer to the stratosphere.
If you want to go to the south ( newer ) part of the strip you can take the skytrain accross the street from the hotel..
Breakfast is nothing special, but i'm shure you'll find something to eat.
If there is nothing big going on at the convention center than the price is ok, otherwise it can be pretty expensive.</p><br>Does the job<p>We chose the Residence Inn because we were in town for a race--and that's the hotel that was contracted for a special rate. For $90/night (during a March Madness weekend), we got an ok place to stay…

The room was huge and clean, with a full kitchen. 2 closets. 1 sink. The bathtub was all right--at least big enough! The morning breakfast, included with the room, was an enormous buffet. If you like breakfast, you'll be happy with the spread of cereals, breads, meat, eggs, yogurt, fruit, and more.

The free wifi in our room didn't work, so we had to pay $5 for the upgraded version. Thanks to the front desk manager, the fee was waived when she found out the free wifi was down and we had made several calls to the help desk without the issue being resolved.

I wasn't a fan of the small pool--pretty weak by Las Vegas standards.

One plus was the monorail stop directly across from the hotel: for $5 you can ride straight to the Strip. Pretty great.

I didn't love this hotel, but it did the job. Safe, clean, and serviceable.
Room Tip: Ask for a room near the lobby.

At first I didn't see the main level bed but it pulls out from the wall. It was very comfy for me and my 4-year old. No casino, but peaceful, pool, grill area and jacuzzi.

As noted by others, the upstairs loft room is open lending to no privacy but still charming. We had a full kitchen with utensils provided like standard RI properties. If we had bought groceries we would have been in great shape to avoid the high prices on the Strip! Instead the comp breakfast hit the spot. On weekends its busy serving until 9:30 AM, the weekdays serving until 9:00 AM which were equally busy. It's most likely due to the LVCC directly across the street. I spied lots of nametags on Monday morning.

I'd recommend for those looking to save some money, however want to have access to the Strip conveniently. We took the LV Monorail up to MGM and then walked through NY, NY to catch the free Tram to Mandalay Bay. I'd probably rent a car next time if I'll be shopping at the outlets, visiting relatives, site seeing and to give my feet a break! Free parking too.

Bonus: They have an ATM that charges a flat $3.95 fee no matter what you amount you withdraw. Remember in case you need cash - ATMs in the casinos are a RACKET.</p><br>Great Location Not Fancy but Clean and QUIET and Homey<p>I was a little bummed at first when my husband picked the Residence Inn for our stay in Las Vegas but after my stay I was very pleased. I usually stay at one of the fancy places on the strip so this was very different. The first thing that stood out was how much more quiet it was and it was nice not hearing all that loud traffic and loud drunk people. The furnishings weren't as pretty as the Cosmopolitan but the were much cleaner and I wasn't afraid to sit on the furniture like I was at another place I stayed. I didn't take part in the complimentary dinner offering of Swedish Meatballs, Rice, Salad, Peanuts and Fresh Baked Cookies that they offered on Thursday Night but I did take part in the Complimentary Breakfast and it was good and saved us some dining money in Vegas.
The bed was comfortable. The shower was easy to work and didn't run out of hot water. Plenty of close and easy parking. The only minor downsides I can think of was the air system was a little loud and the dishwasher leaves the glasses tasting like soap so you have to really rinse out your glasses well to use them and I noticed the free Wifi is slow so it's better to have your own wifi. I didn't bring my dogs with me but I saw they accept dogs.
We also saved a lot of money on taxi rides because of the monorail across the street.

Check out was easy and quick. I'd return it was a good stay!</p><br>decent location, great price<p>I rated this very good because of the value for the price. location: this location was not bad. It was pretty close to the strip but not right in the heart of it (which I preferred). The service was very friendly and prompt. The quality of the room was fine and it even looked like it had been updated recently. There is plenty of parking. The free breakfast was fine – standard for residence inn.</p><br>DISHONEST STAFF AT THE MARRIOTT RESIDENCE INN LAS VEGAS CONVENTION CENTER<p>Just returned from a 6000 mi road trip & spent 5 nights in Vegas. Inadvertently left a hanging bag in room with $1600 worth of clothing. Called within hrs. The bag was in the room when we left..staff absolutely denied finding it. The door was locked when we left and there was no one other than Marriott Residence Inn staff who could have entered and found the bag. Despite numerous calls, Marriott claims there staff "did not see the bag".</p><br>Closest to LVCC Convention Center<p>Stayed at the Residence Inn during CES this year. It was as close to the convention center as possible. Could not get closer. Stayed in a 2 bedroom suite with a coworker. Beware that the 2nd bedroom is an upstairs loft, which is not totally private. No door, half walls, etc. Wasn't a problem for me, but might be for some. Separate bathroom up there. The main bedroom is larger with a double door and private bathroom. The kitchen is great. Living room is good too. The fireplace is a nice touch. They sell duraflame logs in the hotel shop. It is a good place to stay near the LVCC. I would stay there again.</p><br>Very happy<p>We didn't want to be right down on the strip and pay those prices so we tried this. Very pleasantly surprised. Rooms are like a mini condo but it is all one room. The outside is set up with multiple buildings that look like condo units. Each unit has an eating bar and a kitchen with basic dishes, etc. and a sofa and a chair. You can swivel the TV to see it everywhere. Lots of closets. Toilet and tub in a separate room from the sink. Nice sized sink counter top. Very clean and quiet. Easy to get to the strip. And they have breakfast. You can control the thermostat yourself. It is not a window unit. The bed had a nice white comforter and was comfy. Seemed very sound proof to us. Plenty of parking. Staff was very nice. We didn't try the pool. We would stay there again. It is especially good if you are staying a few days or more.
Room Tip: They are two story buildings and you have to walk up outside stairs to get to the second floor so co...

Being right across the street from the convention center and monorail was extremely convenient. It was also easy to hail cabs as necessary. The breakfast was standard fare and good.

The staff was extremely accommodating including holding packages which were shipped to the facility. They couldn't have been nicer or more helpful. Would definitely stay there again.
Room Tip: I was in the 700 block which was away from the main and side streets. Seems like a good bet.
See more room tips</p><br>Easy place to stay<p>The parking is right in front of your condo which makes it easy to get to your room. Good breakfast. Convenient to drive to and from. All the staff was friendly and helpful with directions and suggestions. The only negatives is that basketball court is not in good shape and the pool is not heated.</p><br></body></html>
