<html><head><h3>Residence Inn Las Vegas Convention Center Hotel Reviews Page 15</h3></head><body><br>Inconsistent<p>I've stayed at this hotel before and have always had a clean, comfortable room and an excellent breakfast, which is why I keep coming back. On my two most recent stays the first was exactly as expected. The second however, was not. We checked in, dropped our luggage off and then went out for the evening. It wasn't until we were ready for bed that we discovered that there was no water, well just a little dribble, from both the bathroom sink and the kitchen sink. The tub faucet however had good pressure but the water was dirty and full of what appeared to be green sand. Then the air conditioner couldn't be shut off - no matter what I did, it would just reset itself to some apparently default setting. Well, it was too late to complain then, we were ready for bed and didn't want to either change rooms or have maintenance come in at that hour of the night, This was when we discovered that the mattress sagged so badly in the middle that we had to cling to the side to keep from sliding or rolling into the hole. Needless to say it was an uncomfortable night's sleep. Breakfast was excellent and we were quickly on our way to the airport in the morning. To be fair, this was just one room, but clearly the maid service is not on the ball in reporting problems, or maintenance in fixing them. It was also not the only room available as there were very few rooms occupied that night.
Room Tip: Check that everything in your room works as expected immediately upon check-in!

We were charged an extra $100 because we had some boxes delivered to the hotel. Notice of the charge is buried about 4 menus down in the "plan a meeting" section of their website - not a place a normal guest would look. Although my company spent a Great deal of money they refused to remove the extra charge. Embassy Suites, less than a block away, does not charge this fee, has nicer rooms and better meals. Also, the A/C only kind of works.</p><br>Decent Place To Stay While Attending a Convention<p>Stayed at this property for two nights last week while attending a trade show at the Las Vegas Convention Center. The center is an easy two block walk and the monorail was also across the street, both are convenient from the hotel.

I stayed in one of their studio suites. This is a cookie cutter Residence Inn, nothing to shout home about , you get what you expect, a clean room, with a comfortable bed. The breakfast was standard, more than enough for me to start my day. The staff was friendly and I was allowed an early check-in alhtough the Inn did not seem to be full.

My only complaint is bedside lighting. Most hotels have gone to the flourscent lights which don't produce enough light to read by when placed on nightstand lamps. I run across this almost all the time when I travel.

if attending a convention and you don't want a smoke filled lobby and don't care about gambling, this is a decent property to stay at.
Room Tip: Some of the rooms face the Marriott parking garage which is adjacent to the rear of the property. A...

The pullout bed was so uncomfortable for our grandson that the front desk staff managed to find another mattress to replace the one on it, and we used several blankets as well to try and get rid of the springs that were coming through.Apparently the mattresses have been replaced recently!
Our room was away from the pool area and breakfast room and was very quiet. The grounds are nicely landscaped and well kept. We used the pool on a couple of occasions, and it was nice and uncrowded.
Front desk staff were very good, and the full kitchen and complimentary breakfast much appreciated, especially when traveling with children.
We felt it was good value for a family of 5.</p><br>poor hotel<p>Stayed 3 nights Jul 31- Aug 3 with my elderly Mom, however this hotel is actually perfect for everyone. As usual, you can expect the caring and attentiveness of the entire staff. A special thank you to Melissa. Although we were not in our upgraded penthouse that much, expect to feel completely at home in any suite you may stay in. The complimentary breakfast is a great way to start your day. After all, who wants to walk a mile to buy a cup of coffee in a large Strip hotel. Also, here you will not pay any hidden resort fees. The location is the best. A short walk across the street you can hop on the monorail and get to any part of the strip within minutes. The monorail really is the best way to go if you plan to spend any part of your day on the strip. I would recommend purchasing a 1 day unlimited pass for $14.00. Spend your day and or night at the strip, and stay here for some down time and you cannot go wrong</p><br>Peaceful Location<p>hotel was recently remodeled,but is still old and they are repairing the outside. we had the farthest room from the lobby and the 5 min. walk was unbearable in 105 deg. heat. poolwas in bad need of repair. food was so-so. it was very uncomfortable to sleep because air-conditioner vent blew right on our heads!
Room Tip: stay elsewhere!

Monorail station is 1/2 block away, which helps you get almost anywhere nearby....have stayed here multiple times, keep coming back to same location. Very nice property and landscaping...it may not be the newest place, but managemenet has obviously tried to keep it attractive and put money back into it. This would be a great option for family as well as business trips.</p><br>Friendly and clean<p>This Residence Inn is an older property but in a perfect location just off the Strip, across the street from the Las Vegas Convention Center, and very near a monorail station. The buildings are only two story, with parking just outside the suites. The parking lot is gated. The landscaping and flowers are well done.

The kitchen and living room in our studio had been updated with newer Marriott color and decor, but the bath facilities seemed original.

The check in process was adequate, and room was ready even though we arrived at 2:30pm, before the official check-in time.

This Residence Inn is an oasis among hotels in Vegas. When 5000 rooms and 40 stories are too much, this is a pleasant change and refuge, only two stories, with parking at your doorstep, a few hundred feet from the convention center, and still close to the strip (but maybe not walking distance).

The only irritation we had was the sound of footsteps upstairs ... it was quite apparent.

Also, pizza offers stuck in our door didn't help give us a strong feeling of security, that perhaps the property was wide open for anyone to approach our doorway undeterred by management. But we felt secure during our stay, and had no security problems.

We would definitely stay at this Residence Inn during our next Las Vegas trip.</p><br>Great for families<p>This hotel is the most convenient one to the Las Vegas convention center. Walking distance...directly across the street! It is very clean and has a wonderful staff that attends to all your needs. I called the front desk, because our unit was hot and wouln't cool off, they sent someone, immediately. He took care of the issue, immediately.

This property had everything a business traveler needs...free Internet, roomy accommodations and free FULL breakfast.

There is NO gambling here. It is a 10-15 minute walk to the north end of the strip.

After being on the strip for many hours, this location is perfect to take a break from the crazies!
Room Tip: The penthouse suites are perfect, if traveling with two or more people
