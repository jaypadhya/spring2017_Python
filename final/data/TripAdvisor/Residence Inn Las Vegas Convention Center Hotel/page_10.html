<html><head><h3>Residence Inn Las Vegas Convention Center Hotel Reviews Page 10</h3></head><body><br>Good for convention attendees.<p>This was the second time we'd stayed here for a convention. Both times check-in involved drama and delays - extended negotiations to get the kind of room we wanted. It seems they are inflexible about block bookings and are looking for any opportunity to hike the rate.

We took a 2 storey 2 bed unit. It was okay. The beds are small and not particularly comfortable and the top floor bedroom got hot despite cranking the a/c , which was pretty noisy.

I don't understand why hotels haven't moved into the 21st century with their TV services.

I did like the fact that it was just a short walk to the convention centre. But that also means it's not near good restaurants so we did use the kitchen in the unit more than we wanted to.

All in all, it's okay. Not great value.</p><br>Night in Vegas w/Grandkids<p>Stayed 2-nights @ Res Inn, 2 bedroom multi-level room was perfect for my 6 Grandkids. Plenty of room for sleeping and the 2 bathrooms were handy. Kids enjoyed swimming at the pool and the morning breakfast was nicely stocked and replenished quickly. The rooms and grounds were clean and close enough to the monorail (across the street) or a few blocks drive to the strip. Very quiet location for sleeping :) Would recommend this place for extended stays as well.</p><br>Perfect spot , quiet yet accessible<p>My wife, my daughter, my neice and two grandkids stayed here as our staging point for my daughters wedding at the big hotel with the famous fountains. This was the perfect spot for us. The little kids had the pool to themselves most of the time and the two bigger kids (28 and 29) loved that the monorail station was directly across the street. My oldest daughter was getting married in Vegas and I used Marriott Rewards to stay here three nights for free. (can't beat that price)
Check in was easy and the room was a bi-level suite with full kitchen and two baths. The upper level bedroom is a loft configuration so unless you freeze out the people staying below it can get a bit warm upstairs. We enjoyed the included breakfast and there was a Marriott next door with a great lunch spot Cafe 325 (separate review coming)
We liked the fact that the parking lot was gated and secure. Just a hint, they do not give instructions on how to leave the lots. Once you know it is simple. The gates are on a wire system, you get extremely close to the gates on exit for them to work. We enjoyed our stay here and would definitely stay here again. It is close to strip but a world away.
Room Tip: be prepared to crank up the a/c for the loft to be comfortable

Whew. Suffice it to say, it's great that we had the space to accommodate everybody. We stayed in a two-bedroom suite with a bed in the upstairs loft, a murphy bed in the office area and a bed in the pullout sofa. Fortunately, there are two full bathrooms so there were no lines.

The room itself contains modern amenities: electric stove, flat screen TV's, FREE Wi-Fi (though, it could be spotty once in a while, but overall quite reliable). The kitchen contains pots/pans, cups, plates, cutlery.

Breakfast is great and usually runs between 7:30 am to 9:30 am (depending on day). They serve both hot (eggs, bacon, waffles, oatmeal) and cold (cereals, fruits, yogurt) options. I wasn't a fan of the coffee so I chose the various tea options.

If you have a car, it's a great place to stay since it's out of the Strip, but still easily accessible (parking is free). The tram stop is just a stone's throw away or you could always call a cab.

The staff is very helpful. We checked in well after midnight, but the clerk welcomed me with a smile. Upon checkout, the clerk called me a cab as well as expedited my check out.

Other amenities on the premise include a pool, basketball court and several BBQ outlets. I wish they had an onsite gym, but I believe the Courtyard next door provides free gym access.

If I'm traveling with a group, I would definitely stay here again.
Room Tip: I don't think there is any bad area to select from. We were in building 7 and it was quiet durin...

It is a peaceful, relaxing hotel after a day of sight seeing. The bed was wonderful. I love having a full kitchen too. However, the hotel could use a fresh coat of paint and some updating to the bathrooms. Also the spa was broken for the 4 days we were there, I was sorry to see that.</p><br>Excellent for families<p>Can't really fault this place. The location is very quiet and peaceful.
We stayed in a bi level suite - there were 5 in our party and this was more than adequate space and the 2 bathrooms and bedrooms made this ideal.
It is right next to the monorail station whic I would highly recommend using.
Breakfast was really nice and a great bonus. WIFI was a bit intermittent towards the back of the complex but was always available in the main building. There is also a computer that can be used and a printer is available too.
The only negative point is that the pool was cold!</p><br>Super Convenient location for conventioneers with family<p>We stayed in a two bedroom for a convention. It was very convenient for those of us who had convention sessions to attend yet we were close enough to visit and stay in touch with the rest of the family during the day. Literally across the street from the convention center. A very diverse assortment of breakfast options was tasty and made it easy for the family to have some time together before the convention day started. Full kitchen in the unit also meant we could cook when we wanted to or reheat left overs. You are also across the street from the monorail which can take you to the strip in a matter of minutes. (Get your multiday discount tickets from the Tix 4 Tonight booth). Pool wasn't heated when we were there which was the only downer for the children (and adults who had to go in with them). Room was clean, well kept and very comfortable. Highly recommend, especially for families with a convention attendee. Very reasonably priced.
Room Tip: Two bedroom was comfortable and spacious enough for 4 adults and two children.

Very pleasant experience, extremely friendly staff, good breakfast and comfortable rooms. On top of that, I woke up to the sound of birds singing in a tree on my little piece of lawn in front of the door - it's a shame I had to move back to the Marriott.</p><br>In Las Vegas, but not really. (2 bd loft)<p>Stayed at this location for the Spartan race weekend. Rate of $150ish was not bad for advertised 2 bed room. Upon arrival, we found out the "second bedroom" was actually an open loft right above the converted master bed. Not what we had hoped for.

Good: Room was very large & clean. Full kitchen was unexpected and nice. Free breakfast was more than adequate.

Bad: Room was on the second floor w/ only stair access. Beds were uncomfortable. Parking was not located well from our room. Outdoor pool was not heated. Free internet was lousy.

***The location of the hotel is excellent for most of Vegas if you don't mind driving, taxi or monorail (station is across the street - $14 unlimited for 24 hours.) However, though it is only one block away from the strip, it feels completely disconnected from Vegas as a whole. This can be either good or bad depending on your goals and plans.
Room Tip: Try to find a room closer to the parking lot
