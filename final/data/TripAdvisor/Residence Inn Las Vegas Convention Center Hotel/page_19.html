<html><head><h3>Residence Inn Las Vegas Convention Center Hotel Reviews Page 19</h3></head><body><br>completly aweful!<p>there is one nice thing i have to say about the residence inn they have a good front desk staff. I am outraged with the way i have been treated at this location i advise anyone who is thinking of staying here to either go to the courtyard which is next door they share the same front lot its that close! or... anywhere else! we stayed for 1 week the first 2 nights were good the front desk asked everytime how our stay was remembered our faces it was great until we came home one night and saw that our luggage was gone through half of our leftover pizza was gone as well as some beef jerkey and who knows what else happned when we were gone. we put in a complaint with the fount desk that evening and recieved the answer "i'll tell the manager in the morning" i was upset so the next morning rolled around and i talked with the house keeping manager and she told me "well we give the staff a free lunch so there is no reason why they would do such a thing" 3 days later we have not heard back from them... not a single word. i have called customer service on this issue nothing has been done as of yet so im writting here to save everyone some heart ache and to leave you with the very simple conclusion... if you want to stay in a hotel that is dirty, steals from your room and doesnt do anything about it... please by all means stay here... but at your own risk!</p><br>Dirty - Do Not Stay<p>I stayed at this place with my family for two nights 12/24 ~ 12/26/09. My main issue with the place: it is dirty! The carpet looks dirty and worn out. I found hairs on the sheet and the blanket. The towels smell bad. I am a loyal Marriott member and normally stay with Marriott property at least 20 nights per year. This property is probably the worst I have ever seen. I understrand some places may be old or outdated, but I cannot tolerate dirty places.

I have other issues with this property. The pullout sofa bed is very soft and uncomfortable. Breakfast runs low on food. On my second day there were no yogurt or bagel.

The only plus side is the staff. They are very friendly and nice.</p><br>average, average, average<p>there isn't anything REALLY wrong with this hotel, but then again, there is nothing to get enthusiastic about either. this is the second time i have stayed there, and this stay only confirmed my opinion from the first time (last year)
the breakfast is adequate, but they do not replenish it as much as they should. we ate around 8 am and found that the fruits, eggs, etc. were low and were in need of refilling.

the computer near the front desk was not working very well - it took one lady over 20 minutes to just print out her 3 emails. don't know what the deal was with that!

the studio bed was VERY soft - and tho it was a queen, my husband and i kept rolling in toward each other. made the bed seem smaller than a queen.

the kitchen was clean, but it lacked dish soap, so we left our dirty dishes in the sink. we would have cleaned them if there was dish soap.

the sofa was on the old side and lumpy. luckily we didn't have to sit on it too long. the air conditioning worked just fine tho. the one down side that did bother us is that the walls are so thin that when someone put on the shower or flushed the toilet, you could really hear it. we kept the air conditioning on so that it would mask some of the noise.

the front desk was very courteous, and that's to be appreciated. the big draw to the place is that it is across the street from the convention center. however, if you will pay a few bucks more, go to the marriott renaissance which is right NEXT TO the convention center. it is much nicer, tho i don't think that it comes with a free breakfast.</p><br>There are Better Options in Vegas<p>This is a great location for business at the convention center and it is nice to be off the strip. Other than that, Las Vegas and Marriott have better options to choose from than this location. Great if you have children and don't mind children everywhere but for a single traveler, this is a pass. The breakfast area is very crowded and the food is not kept up very well. Stayed in a 1 bedroom and I was a bit disappointed because I have stayed at other Residence Inns. The bed is very uncomfortable and the property can be a bit noisy. Spend a bit more cash and find something nicer in Vegas.</p><br>Valentine's Getaway...Perfect location,hotel and friendly staff<p>My husband and I have not been to vegas for a while (i'm talking about several years) and I thought of surprising him by booking a getaway to vegas for our valentines. This hotel is a perfect place to stay and I'll tell you why...my husband and I got sick by the time we got to vegas.( I know ..really suckkedd esp when it was a valentine's weekend) He came down with severe cold and flu and so did I. On our first night, we checked in at 9pm and the front desk guy was a very nice man. We were having small talk and in that talk we asked for the nearest walgreens and also some good restaurants for delivery. Not only he gave us the directions to the store, he also recommend this good & cheap chinese rest. The next morning I called up the front desk and asked if I could take the breakfast back to my room since my husband wasn't feeling too well...and the guy said it was fine..I have been to plenty of hotels and sometimes they have problems bringing meals back to your room but not this place. After feeling ok after a day or so, we decided to go out to the strip... We had the same guy who helped us check in, get us a cab..to my husband any my surprise, he remembered us being sick and asked how we were feeling and if everything was ok..I was simply amazed..In a busy city like vegas...who remembers who but not this guy..This is my main reason to go back and stay here again.. Few other things:
Nice location: You get ur privacy..and still feel like ur in vegas
Friendly staff: We asked to extra blankets & towels and immediately got them. Front desk ee's was so pleasant!
Room: Nice , big studio room. They has kitchen so you can make your own coffee,tea and even warm up your dinner..fridge and dish washer
Parkng: FREE!!!
Overall: LOVED IT!!!! We are very simple,easy going and very private couple and this place was beyond my expectation..We will definitely stay here again in future.. BIG THANKS TO JUSTIN (Front desk guy :)</p><br>Comfortable Hotel, great staff<p>The mother in law was in nearby Sunrise Hospital so we stayed here. We stay at a lot of Resi Inns and the staff at this one went way out of their way to be friendly and make us feel comfortable. Room was big and clean although it had a well-used feel to it. The down-stairs room had a suprisingly comfortable murphy bed.
We will definately stay again.</p><br>Quiet with comfortable accomidations!<p>Having a kitchen in Vegas is a great idea - especially if you're going to take advantage of the amazing meals around town and have left-overs to nibble.

The accommodations meet your needs without being lavish, but there's plenty of lavish in Vegas elsewhere. The hotel is located adjacent to the elevated monorail making the mile or so walk unnecessary, unless you're interested in walking to the strip.

I did not hear neighbors walking above us; we were on the ground floor with one level above us. The breakfast was eggs, pancakes, cereal, and fruit: a nice selection targeting the rodeo people who were in town that week.

The only drawback was the hotel's inability to prevent solicitors papering the rooms. in the late afternoon over 10 menus were stuffed under our door which does not give the feeling of privacy or safety.

If you're frugal and wondering if this place is worth it, I believe it is a good deal.</p><br>Very Outdated &amp; loud<p>Had to extend our stay unexpectedly and went to the yellowpages to see places with a kitchen

Only the Residence Inn Convention Centre had an ad (unfortunately for us); so, based on past experiences with the brand, I figure it cant be that bad

Now, Residence Inn is not a 5 star resort -- i know that; but this RI is definitely showing its age

OUTDATED
We got a studio room with a queen bed. The kitchen cabinets & stove looked like it hasnt been updated since the 80s. Bathroom was the same (had a wood sliding door for the shower/bathtub area)

LOUD
- it's underneath the flightpath for LAS airport = frequent buzz/noise; we stayed at Mandalay Bay (beside the airport) and didnt hear planes taking off/landing

- ventilation system; we had to shutoff the HVAC since it was just too loud

- fridge (probably another sign of age...), quite noisy as well when it starts up every so often

"Positives"
The breakfast is standard Residence Inn; business centre has 2 computers with internet access

There's a pool (didnt use; but was open even in early dec) & on-site laundry

Monorail & convention centre is directly next door, so it's convenient in that sense; the roads around the hotel have center dividers, so you have to be travelling in a certain direction to enter the hotel (either southbound on Paradise, or westbound on Dessert Inn)

Clean room & linen

Staff friendly (didnt really have much interaction)</p><br>Quiet &amp; convenient to convention center<p>This Residence Inn is designed in an apartment complex style. It's extremely clean and quiet, which is a refreshing change from the strip. It's directly across the street from the convention center. The strip is a little over a half mile away. The road to the strip is pretty isolated at night, and as a woman, I wasn't comfortable walking the route to the strip alone at night, but I felt safe walking with another person and saw other convention-goers doing the same. The monorail is directly across the street, so that is another quick and safe way to get to the strip, and taxis are everywhere. The service at this hotel was as good as I've experienced at other Residence Inns around the country. The desk staff was friendly and attentive, and the housekeeping staff was great. Breakfast was hot, fresh, and well stocked. I'd definitely stay here again the next time I'm in town for a convention.</p><br>all round value despite the apparent higher room price<p>Jul17-25 2008. Stayed during a bridge tournament held at the Hilton located a (long, hot 108F Las Vegas) block away. I could say that without reservation, the staff were all helpful, friendly and genuinely happy to be of assistance. We stayed in an upstair unit. All have fully equiped kitchen with oven, dishwasher, fridge and microwave allowing us to cater for ourselves instead of eating out everynight. They will even do the grocery shopping for you if you tell them what you want. The maid will also clean the dishes if you really want a holiday. Each room has a sitting area, free highspeed internet. You can use their barbecue if you want to although it is a bit of a walk from some units. The pool is pleasant and clean although some might say that it could do with a little more shade. Every morning, the free breakfast buffet includes some variation on the fare offered, breaking the potential monotony of the hot food selection. Happy hour on week nights at 5:30pm can provide enough for small appetites to avoid seeking dinner on their own. More impressive was the little things that take away the "nickel and dime" feeling some other places impose : e.g. two free computers for guests to use in the lobby that include free printer use if you need. Others have complained of the aircond noise but we found it acceptable although the vents sometimes can feel poorly directed when you are in bed and the ability to adjust the direction of cool air is limited. We feel that this facility is well located for those who don't want to be on the strip or need to be at the convention center. It provides value in the inclusion of a substantial breakfast, happy hour and the versatility of full kitchens. We would not hesitate to return to the Residence at a future date. True, it is not the Wynn or Bellagio - but it doesn't try to be of that genre.</p><br></body></html>
