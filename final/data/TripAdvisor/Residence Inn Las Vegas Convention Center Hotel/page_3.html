<html><head><h3>Residence Inn Las Vegas Convention Center Hotel Reviews Page 3</h3></head><body><br>One night stay. Just fine.<p>The location is nice, it,s just off of the strip. The weird thing about Residence Inns, is that people rent these rooms to live in. So we got here and they were having a neighborhood jam ball game and there were a few families swimming, so we felt a little like we were intruding.
We had a two room suite.One on the main floor that had a Murphy bed and with a bathroom, and the other room upstairs in a loft (also with a bathroom)
Also, a small kitchen and sitting room.

The room decor---Picture "Three's Company" meets minor 2010 renovations.
The room was clean, the parking lot had plenty of spaces, the staff was friendly.
The price was very reasonable for 2 rooms. I would stay here again.
Remember, you are downtown Las Vegas, so there were some shady characters walking around, so just be aware and be smart.</p><br>Good location across from Convention Center<p>I like this hotel. Good work area and the room is comfortable. Breakfast is ok. None of the computers worked in the lobby. I noticed they run XP so this isn't a surprise. No wifi in the rooms and you have to go to the reception area for wifi. They had an Ethernet connection in the room so you would need an ap to make it work.</p><br>So great...I almost want to keep it a secret!<p>Fabulous location if you are coming to a trade show---right across from the convention center. However, if you are coming to Vegas to live it up on the strip--probably not the hotel for you - it's off the strip.
Great rates for all the extras you get.
The staff are incredible: Susan at the front Desk, Romero in the hospitality dept.
They have a great breakfast that is included.
And on Mondays -Wednesdays they offer a free Happy Hour and a couple of nights they have free appetizers and dinner as well. All of which were delicious.
Rooms are spacious.
I travel to Vegas a few times a year for trade shows and this is my new favorite hotel.</p><br>Solid Week Stay<p>I could quibble with this property, but overall this was a great place to stay as a home base for house hunting trip. The room was very clean and the housekeeping staff was attentive. The free breakfast was a big plus as was the full kitchen. It's a quiet property, away from the Strip, but close enough to walk.

The downsides were minor: the wifi was spotty at peak times. I suspect if you paid then extra few bucks, you'd have no problem. The pull-out couch was good for our daughter, but an adult might feel the springs.

Overall, this was an awesome stay!</p><br>GREAT HOTEL..Across from Convention Center<p>Wonderful Experience at this hotel. Nice Pool, Very Clean Rooms. Full Kitchen, Livingroom and Bedroom. Directly across the street from the Convention Center for our Trade Show. Taxi Cabs pick up right at your door. Service in the restaurant and bar was great. Look forward to going back!</p><br>Very convenient to the convention center<p>Stayed at this property this past week for the National SHRM convention. This was very convenient to be able to walk across the street to the convention (particularly given the average temperatures of 110-115!). Property had all the typical Residence Inn amenities. There were a lot of people staying here the week I was there, but the staff did a nice job of keeping the breakfast buffet stocked, etc. Housekeeping staff also did a nice job cleaning the room.</p><br>Nice location off the strip<p>In town for a one day business trip, chose this mainly for location as it was close to the airport and my appointments plus rate was good.
Typical Residence Inn property, very secure.
They had a food truck come in for that nights evening reception, I chose to go somewhere else for dinner.
Quiet property, I walked to the strip for exercise...not too far.</p><br>Would stay again, very good service<p>So clearly if you are booking here you should not be expecting the Bellagio's 20+ restaurants and bars, or the Wynn's high end casino, or Treasure Island's elaborate shows. You will book here because you'll get a nice (generally quiet) room that is clean and has full kitchen. I was here for a convention and the location was convenient. It's not the hotel's fault that it was "100 and he'll" degrees outside which made even the short 5-10 minute walk a challenge. I stayed with a friend & colleague in the 2 bedroom bi-level suite and it worked out great. I'd highly recommend the arrangement for families and good friends. It's set up as a loft so there is limited sound privacy, but there is decent visual privacy. We had one issue with the fan not working and upon calling the front desk, maintenance was there in 5 minutes and fixed the issue efficiently and very friendly manner. We also used the grocery service which was very convenient. I'd definitely stay here again, hopefully at some time of the year when the temps are not 110+!!</p><br>Nice 1st Generation Residence Inn<p>This is a nicely maintained first generation Residence Inn. My room was clean, yet seemed like it was due for a renovation in the near future. The selection in the "Market" was pretty sparse. I was a bit disappointed with the clerk at the front desk. After checking me in without ever even cracking a smile, I asked for a good restaurant fairly close to the hotel, and she recommended the Marriott coffee shop down the street. I tried to joke with her that it's too bad in a nouveau-foodie town like Vegas, that Marriott has her recommending a Marriott coffee shop. She wasn't buying it...she came back with a seemingly well-rehearsed line, "...it's close to the hotel and they specialize in classic American fare..." Which of course, is true. Nonetheless, I suggest looking somewhere other than the front desk for restaurant recommendations. And if you happen to want excellent classic American fare, try Peppermill's...which is also just down the street.</p><br>Nice, but customer service lacking<p>This hotel is directly across from the LV Convention Center. Nice bungalow style rooms. I'm attending a convention across the street and decided to bring my mom for company since I am here 5 days. I asked to change my room to two beds instead of a king and was told that since I booked through Expedia they couldn't do anything for me. Please note, I am not asking for an upgrade, a free room or anything I would consider special. I am even willing to pay any difference in room charge. Sorry, I'm told, there is nothing we can do. So I am stuck sleeping on the HIGHLY UNCOMFORTABLE sofa bed. Even with the foam mattress they give you, it just plain is not great. That being said...I do not recommend this facility if you think there is even the slightest chance you might want to modify your room type. In this age of technology does anyone book direct to the hotels when you can go to a site that lists everything at a glance? You disappoint me Marriott. I will be sure to let the 85,000 attendees at the convention across the street know about it too via the convention app.
Room Tip: don't book through a travel site otherwise you're screwed
