<html><head><h3>Residence Inn Las Vegas Convention Center Hotel Reviews Page 12</h3></head><body><br>Exactly what we wanted<p>This Residence Inn is conveniently located about a block away from the Convention Center monorail station, so no need to drive to the strip. The on-site parking is a breeze, no ginormous parking garage to negotiate or valets to deal with. Being at the north end of the strip, it is very easy to drive out to Fremont St., Red Rock park, etc.

The 2-br unit we stayed in was clean and quiet, and totally met our expectations. It was nice to have a kitchenette with a coffeemaker, microwave, refrigerator and stove (never used the stove, but it was there if we needed it). The beds were very comfortable. We had to climb a flight of stairs to reach our unit, but that was no concern for us.

If you want to stay away from the strip, but would like to be able to get to the strip easily via the monorail, I think this is an ideal location.</p><br>Tranquility.......<p>Stayed 3 nights in October in a studio room, number 2423. which comes with a fully equipped kitchen. The rest of the furnishing is as advertised and have all the trappings of a comfortable home. Having stayed the previous 2 nights in a casino hotel in the Strip where our senses are stretched to the limit, the tranquility offered by this hotel is just what we needed.

It is located next to a Courtyard and behind the Marriott (in fact, on the days that it is opened, we used the back gate of Marriott as a short cut to walk to the Strip). It took us about 20 minutes to walk to Vegas Boulevard. Even though it is safe to walk, which we did 3x during our 4 days stay, the walk back at night can be scary as there isn't much pedestrian traffic on this stretch of the road.; It is less than 10 minutes to the RTC stops (both North and South bound, which is across the road from each other) at the Convention Center; and less than 15 minutes of taxi ride to the airport.

Breakfast is crowded over the weekend but not so on the weekdays but even then they replenished the food as quickly as they could. The spread is pretty good - for the days we were there, we had scramble eggs, fried diced potato, yogurt, bananas, coffee/tea, and toast with butter and cream cheese. There were other items such as waffle, cereals, biscuits, and juice.

We would love to come back.</p><br>Do Not stay at this hotel!<p>There is a reason to have the privacy sign posted which is to have privacy. On both days, the maids rudely entered our room with the do not disturb sign out and then to my dismay put the do not disturb sign back in the room.

Upon our arrival we registered our pets. When the maid opened the door she could have let our pets out. They may have been lost forever. I tried to talk to the Manager about this and the damage charge that was accessed for our room and she rudely transferred me to the supervisor of the maids and she barely spoke English. I am a platinum Marriott member and thought it would be polite to discuss damages if they felt there were any. The chair at the desk is made out of fake leather that is not durable. There were already tears on the chair and we were made to pay for it. Our pets do not cause damage.

The supervisor then lied and said she tried to contact me via email and by phone and I did not have any missed calls or email.

Marriott, please review the management of this property. The food was not hot, they did not have enough staff on duty to serve the number of guests for breakfast and the whole area was not in disarray and not clean.

We will not be staying here again and I would highly advise against you choosing this poor facility as well!

Oh I forgot to mention, the KING bed is actually smaller than a queen!</p><br>Across from the convention center, good location, smoke free.<p>This is a hotel that good for family vacation. They have kitchen and the basic for cooking.
It is spacious but kind of out of date. The best of it is smoke free in the premises.
It is very hard to find a hotel that is smoke free in Vegas. So it is suitable for bring the kids here for the vacation. If you are here to attend the exhibition, it is also very near the convention center with walking distance. However the air conditioner is kind of too loud because of the old style, maybe?
Room Tip: Ask for the first floor. There is no elevator for the guest stay in the second floor. If you are b...
See more room tips</p><br>perfect place to recharge<p>We were in town to see a Jimmy Buffett concert and the prices for the strip were crazy! We hit triple sevens with this hotel. It is located across the street from the monorail station and convention center, very convenient mode of transportation, if you are going to be there more than one day , get the multi day pass, well worth the money. Breakfast is included and it's more than just cereal and yogurt. I had Belgian waffles with whipped cream, caramel and Choco chips, sausage, home fries, fresh fruit and coffee. Do go early to the breakfast, things get busy quick. They have a nice outside seating area next to the pool to enjoy your meal. Wifi is free in the room, they have a nice pool with lounge chairs, tables and umbrella's if that's your choice. The room was clean and well appointed. The front desk supervisor was extremely helpful to us as we had certificates from our banks reward program and we didn't follow the correct steps in booking the room, so she had to jump through a few hoops to get everything straightened out. Nice job, it all worked out ! I would recommend this hotel if you want to visit the craziness of the strip yet have a quiet place to lay your head and recharge your body.</p><br>I nice little haven in La Vegas<p>I attended a trade show hosted at the Las Vegas convention centre in October of 2013. I had been to Las Vegas many times in the past and had really started to dislike staying at the larger Casino hotels. It would always drive me crazy not to have a coffee maker in my room, have to walk 1\2 mile to check in and to eat, the noise galore and those lengthy line ups for everything. Considering I am usually in Vegas for work, my interest in the "tourism gambling thing" is long gone. I searched the web and found the Residence Inn. What peaked my interest was it situation to the convention centre. ( It is right across the street ) Great, no waiting for a taxi or bus in the morning etc. The residence inn also offered free breakfast, which, by the way, was very good. I booked my room for 5 days and was very happy with my decision. The accommodation units are like little condo's, fully equipped with a kitchen, living room, flat screen TV, nice bathrooms etc. It is also very quiet, has a court yard, pool and plenty of parking spaces. Mind you, this is not a new facility, but it is very clean and functional. Ok, the fridge made a bit too much noise and when my neighbours took a shower in the morning it helped wake me up. These little things did not distract me from enjoying my stay and will absolutely return on my next Vegas visit. The Vegas strip is a 1\2 mile walk away and there are plenty of restaurants near by. ( Also the staff were very nice )
Room Tip: There were all decent.
See more room tips</p><br>Walk to the convention center, get a free breakfast<p>If you need a place to crash when attending a convention at the Las Vegas Convention Center, this is a very convenient place. There is free breakfast that includes toast/bagels/muffins, eggs, meat (bacon or sausage), french toast or pancakes, make your own waffles, oatmeal, dry cereal, a fruit and yogurt. The rooms have nice kitchenettes and decent bathrooms but the rest of the room feels a bit dated. We stayed on the second floor and the stairs were a bit rickety but our room was quiet. There is a free happy hour with white and red wine, beer on tap and soda from 5:30 - 7:00. They had pulled pork sandwiches and a salad the night we went. Their partner hotel, the Courtyard by Marriott, is right next door. You can get a nice glass of wine and a meal there, or take it to go. It's owned by the same folks as the Residence Inn. The convention center is across the street. Walking to the strip takes about a 20 minutes. The closest "mega" strip hotel is the Wynn/Encore. It was a decent value, if you are on a budget and are only there for a trade show I'd give this place a thumbs up. If you want a real Vegas experience, stay closer to or on the strip.
Room Tip: If you are sharing with a friend or business associate, ask for a room with two actual beds, otherwi...
See more room tips</p><br>Typical Residence Inn out of the chaos of LV Boulevard.<p>Great staff and location is fine if you don't care for the constant noise of The Strip. Monorail station is across the street to get to casinos both north and south. Nice pool and whirlpool. Breakfast was fine.</p><br>Always stay here.<p>We stay here every time we are in Vegas. Usually we are attending a convention at the LV Convention Center, which is a short 5 minute walk.

They are currently renovating rooms or are about done. Our room was renovated and nicely done. Modern kitchen cabinets with frosted glass cabinet doors. Modern cabinet hardware. New stainless steel fridge, stove/oven, dishwasher and microwave. New carpet throughout. Fresh paint. Furniture might be new, but not sure.

We had a rental car so we went to Walmart Super center and got our groceries. Cooked in the room every day and saved $$$$.

Check-in was smooth. Check-out was smooth, except trying to print out our boarding passes because of the girl on her facebook account for an hour and the guy using the other computer shopping for a cordless drill. Neither one of them would get off of the computers.

Free hot/cold breakfast every morning from 6-9:30. On the weekends, it is tough for staff to keep up with the crowds, but they usually did a good job. Very friendly staff! Nice pool and hot tub with a patio area and lounge chairs.

Very secure location! Security cameras and gated.
Room Tip: Must stay if you are attending a convention at the convention center.
See more room tips</p><br>Nice oasis near the strip.<p>This is a nice low key, non-smoking hotel set among trees near the "strip". It is very quiet and does not have any gambling machines -great for children.This was our second stay at this hotel. The staff was nice and always greeted you with a smile. Breakfast was average. We had issues with several TV channels not working and a cranky thermostat. The hotel is very average.
Room Tip: Rooms toward the back of the property are quieter.
