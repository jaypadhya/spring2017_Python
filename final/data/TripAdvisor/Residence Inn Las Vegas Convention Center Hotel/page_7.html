<html><head><h3>Residence Inn Las Vegas Convention Center Hotel Reviews Page 7</h3></head><body><br>Quiet oasis across from Las Vegas convention center<p>My husband and I go to Las Vegas for a scuba trade show every other year, usually staying at a much cheaper hotel near Walgreens. This time we decided to upgrade, and were happy we did! At the Marriott Residence Inn we were actually in a large room with a queen bed, full kitchen, and small living room. The bathroom had a tub/shower combo and lots of counter space. The bed is located in an area away from windows, and the windows had great black-out drapes, making it easier to sleep. Other than a little bit of noise from upstairs once or twice, it was very quiet. We did hear planes overhead a few times, but they didn't disturb our sleep. The hotel had separate buildings (we were in #21) with only two stories each. The hotel is practically across the street from the convention center, an easy walk, and near the public bus, which we took to and from the airport for only $2.00 each way. There is a small outdoor pool, but it was too cold to use while we were there. The included breakfast buffet was great, with make-your-own waffles, scrambled eggs, oatmeal, cereal, muffins, toast, etc. They also have small snacks/meal/beer evenings a couple times a week, which we missed out on. The in-room wifi was good and they also have a couple computers in the lobby for guest use. The day we checked out we were able to store our luggage until the trade show was over and we headed back to the airport on our $2.00/person bus.

We ate dinner at Denny's (near Walgreens) once, and had leftovers the next night (thank you, refrigerator), and also ate at the Westgate Hotel, attached to the convention center, at the Burger Bistro--the very large hamburgers were delicious.

We will stay at this hotel next time we go to Las Vegas.</p><br>Excellent hotel for north Vegas strip<p>we stayed here for a friends wedding. We chose it because of its north Las Vegas strip location. Is practically across the street from the convention center. Is within walking distance of the Strip (little under 1mi) and monorail, but this isn't the nicest part of Vegas so be careful walking at night. Also know your Vegas strip because this is a north Las Vegas location, is not in walking distance to many other resorts ( say Mandalay bay for example)
There is no casino or gambling at this hotel, so if you've come to gamble, you won't find any action here (which can be a good thing)
The room was decent with a well appointed kitchen including full-sized appliances and decent cooking utensils ( this is above average for other Residents Inns I've stayed at). Environmental controls worked well and everything worked as expected. Bed was on average, would have preferred a king size bed though. Did not use the pool or spa, but breakfast served on Saturday and Sunday mornings was excellent.
One downside is that hotel is on the flight path of airport so you will hear airplanes. This didn't bother us much and seemed to disappear after 11pm. If your looking for a decent north Las Vegas location with the ability to make your own food, this hotel is an excellent choice</p><br>Rest &amp; Relaxation 9 night stay<p>We chose Residence Inn because we have been long time Marriott customers and because we feel we know what we are going to get in terms of a good bed together with high standards throughout.
Following a prompt and pleasant check-in our first challenge was that we couldn't open the door even though the keycard produced a green light. The "utility" man showed up very quickly and opened the door with a very hard twist of the handle. My arthritic wrists found it very difficult to produce the same result. They couldn't seem to fix this problem.

The next problem was the bed with was a very very poor mattress. The worst Marriott mattress we have ever slept upon. Soft and jiggles - like riding a dolphin I suppose.

Not long after checking in we realized we were across the street from the convention centre which that day were running unbelievable noisy cars demonstrating tires at high speed circles in the parking lot of the convention center. Fortunately that ended about 9 pm the first night but was quickly replaced by roughly 2-3 passenger jets per every 5 minutes taking off at full throttle directly over our hotel property. This was constant and just as loud in our room as at the pool. Oddly the noise could barely be heard in the office area.

One night, we returned to find our room had not been made up - they credited us the room fee for the night, but ...

This property is old and we knew it - but the problems, particularly the mattress were way below Marriott standards.
Room Tip: Be aware this is a tired but clean and fairly well managed quality chain location. Staff tried hard...

Our room was very large, and clean, king bed with a pull out couch. The property is very spread out, with rooms located in 2 storey buildings in blocks. We were at the very far corner at the back, which wasn't the best location, we got tired of walking lol. It is a great hotel if you're there for a convention, as the convention centre is right across from it. We were mainly visiting the strip and downtown, so I would have rather been closer to the strip. However the price was right! We walked to the strip during the day, it was a little sketchy on the way, so I wouldn't recommend it at night or without a couple friends. The staff were great, at check in and throughout our stay. The breakfast was awesome. Lots of choices, eggs, bagels, muffins, danishes,oatmeal fruit, yogurt, sausage/bacon, waffles one day, pancakes another day and fabulous cofee. Pool area was nice, but the pool was freezing cold. Hot tub was out of order during our stay, but we didn't mind, as we were too busy to use it. Outside patio area was really nice as well. Could not connect to the wifi with my tablet at all - grrrr. My husband was able to on his phone, but it was slow. Overall a decent stay :)</p><br>Near the Strip<p>Ramiro was very helpful and nice. We are greeted warmly and gave us some pointers on what to expect/see on strip especially if we are gonna go to clubs. He also helped us get a taxi for party of 5. Location was very close to strip so taking taxi is convenient than driving especially if you want to have fun at the bars.. Room was very clean and big. Old but very well maintained. Will surely come back.</p><br>Great for conventions<p>Right across the street from the convention center. Rooms are nice, clean, plenty of space. Breakfast is good, managers reception was good and hosted by an excellent very engaging individual. Internet service in the room was fair to poor. This is a business hotel and the fact that the internet service is poor is pretty sad.

Place is an easy walk to the strip, however after sunset I would only do the walk in a group. Road between the hotel and the strip is a little dark and there were a few people I would not wanted to come into contact with in the area

I would probably stay here again</p><br>Residence Inn the Standard for Extended Stay<p>Stayed here in July 2013 with a total of 6. This is the only place in town that can handle 6 people. They gave me a suite with a downstairs bedroom and bathroom, sofa sleeper, upstairs loft with a bathroom also. Two TVs, a full kitchen and two full baths. Free breakfast was great. In room internet was splotchy (bring a cat-5 cable), pool was great. Parking lot has gates to keep out the riff raff. Across the street from the convention center, short walk to north strip. The room even had a fireplace, although not used because it was Summer.
Room Tip: Bring a cat-5 cable!

We have stayed here in the past solely for the easy access to the convention center. The downside is that this property has a real problem getting cabs. At times it was a 45 minute wait. They even posted a sign saying so.

Sadly, this property has followed the trend of installing "sensing" thermostats. Regardless of how you set the cooling, when you leave, it cuts off. When you come in at the end of the day, you walk into a hot room that takes too long to cool down. Even worse, the same thing happens at night when nobody is moving around. Air conditioning goes off.
Room Tip: Upper rooms are stairs only. Upper rooms then have a 2nd bedroom that is up more stairs.
See more room tips</p><br>Great hotel for long stay. Perfect for convention center.<p>A nice clean hotel with great rooms for longer stays. We had a loft suite that has 2 bedrooms and it was large enough for 4 people. A nice kitchen with everything you need. The bathrooms were nice. Comp breakfast was good. Good location across from the mono-rail that gives easy access to the strip. Directly across from convention center.
Room Tip: 2 bedroom loft suite is best deal.
See more room tips</p><br>walking distance to the strip<p>We walked to the strip from this hotel, but at night walked very fast. Our hotel room was not touched by housekeeping the first night we stayed at this facility, we called the front desk and they stated housekeeping had gone home for the rest of today, so I stated we also have ants in the bathroom. Front desk sent maintenance who brought us new towels and sprayed for the ants. Breakfast was good as usual for residence inn hotels.</p><br></body></html>
