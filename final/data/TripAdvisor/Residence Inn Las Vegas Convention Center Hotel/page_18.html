<html><head><h3>Residence Inn Las Vegas Convention Center Hotel Reviews Page 18</h3></head><body><br>oops<p>This is a very old, sad property. It has the basics that you need and was actually fairly clean. However surfaces were worn and chipped and the "king" sized bed was not.
They do serve a free hot breakfast but once the intial offering ran out (scrambled eggs for example) the staff did not replenish although the walked by several times.
I would not stay here again.
Stairs-no elevator to 2nd floor.</p><br>Immaculate Room, Honest Staff<p>I arrived in Vegas at night totally exhausted after a 14 hour drive. The Strip was filled with bumper-to-bumper automobiles steered by wannabe NASCAR drivers. I had no reservation. (Yes, this was stupid on my part. You know the old saying, "Sometimes stupid happens".)

My first need was to find a motel/hotel where I could park & unload my car -- as opposed to paying a valet to hide my car in a mega-parking garage.

I hit the jackpot. By accident I soon discovered the "Resident Inn" sign surrounded by low-rise, condo-like units. The lady at check-in could not have been nicer. She led me to a first floor room facing my car. She also gave me an honest rate -- rather than take advantage of a tired guest.

The large suite/room contained a full kitchen and a comfortable couch sitting area. Everything was immaculate! As we were walking back to the desk for paperwork, she urged me to take advantage of the complimentary dinner -- which was about to shut down for the night.

The complimentary breakfast was, also, excellent. It included scrambled eggs, sausage, potatoes, oatmeal, fruits, and many goodies. It was served in a lobby/TV room that reminded me of a cozy Bed & Breakfast.

Across the street, you can board the monorail for a good overview of downtown Vegas.

Personally, I'd much rather stay in this "You are a person" Resident Inn, than in a "You are a number" mega-casino.

This Inn was truly an "Oasis in the Desert"!</p><br>No frills but CLEAN and CONVENIENT<p>This hotel is spotless, roomy, a great value and conveniently located to the monorail so you can access the strip. Also, cabs are $5 to the top of the strip if you prefer that. Free breakfast is nice. Free popcorn in the room is GREAT after a night on the town! Stayed here with my husband for two days and would definitely recommend.</p><br>Very clean and nice hotel with friendly staff!<p>I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights using Marriott points. It was not on the Strip but since it’s across the street from the Convention Center, transportation was easy, take Bus 108 at the airport for $2 and it stopped right at the hotel in just 25 minutes. Because of the early flight I arrived at the hotel at 9 am and check-in was fast and easy and I got my room in 2 minutes. The room was in reasonable size with a sitting area and a mini kitchen. Because of the new carpet, the whole room looked very new and clean. Except the cabinets in the kitchen and the bathroom that looked a bit aged, everything in the room was just fine, the bed was very comfortable with extra blanket and pillows and lots of storage space. The complimentary breakfast was great with scramble egg, beacon, sausage, cereals, bread and pastry…….just to give you a good start of the day.

All the staff at the receipt desk were very nice and friendly and tried their very best to help. The first night I wanted to use the computer at the lobby but it was not working, the lady at the night shift found another computer for me so I could check my email; and the next morning, the computer was fixed. But one thing that can be improved was that the staff may just drive to work so they were not quite familiar with the local public transportation and couldn’t give me the right info even they have tried very hard to do so. My advice is to pay $7 for a 24-hour RTC pass so you can catch all the buses in front of the hotel, on the strip and the vicinity, which can take you to all major hotels on the strip and downtown and also to the airport and the premium outlet mall. The monorail was too expensive (the convention center station was just across the street) so there were not too many passengers and you won’t feel safe especially at night time, all the stations were so quite and empty!

Overall this is a very nice and comfortable hotel and if you don’t mind to be a bit away from the strip (about 15 minutes walk back to the strip), it’s a very good choice.</p><br>Great place if you are here for work and dont want a casino hotel<p>Stayed here for nearly two weeks in October for work in Las Vegas. I could not have asked for a better non-casino place near the Strip. It is directly across the street from the Las Vegas Convention center and a short walk to the monorail station that can take you to the Strip. This place is good for business travelers that need a clean comfortable extended stay type facility. My room was modern and updated. I agree that the other reviews about it being worn and dated are harsh. My room was fairly new and fresh. Rooms have a full kitchen, sitting area, large flat screen TV, large desk and internet station, plenty of storage space. There is a pool and guest laundry facilities. You can use the fitness room at their sister hotel, the Courtyard, next door. It was an easy walk. Also, next door at the Courtyard they have a small upscale cafe that is good for a quick sandwich or cocktail. It is a bit too far off the Strip to easily walk. One would need to take the monorail or call a cab. The front desk can have you a taxi in about five minutes. Everyone on staff was friendly. The grounds are attractive and well maintained. You need a room key to enter the driveway / parking area, which was nice as there was no through traffic. Despite being in the heart of Vegas, there was little noise. Some negatives include that their advertised "managers reception" that provides beer/wine and heavy appetizers some nights, were not very good. I went twice that that was twice too many. The quality of the food here was poor. The lady serving it was very nice, but the food was bad and beer was flat. Also, they do advertise a free morning breakfast. I went once and it was a typical hotel "free" breakfast, but I was turned off by the crowds trying to get in there and eat - like hogs to the trough. I mainly chose to eat in my room and thats the main reason I stayed here, was to have a full kitchen, go buy groceries and do it myself. This was much more pleasant after a long hard day working. I would highly recommend this place for a convention center business traveler that has no interest in casinos. If you need easy walking access to the strip, lots of restaurants, casinos, etc. this place is not for you. I would stay here again for a business trip. If I were coming to enjoy the Strip, I would stay at another hotel on the Strip.</p><br>Likely top notch after the renos<p>This hotel struck me as a condo complex which was converted to a hotel. All rooms are walk-ups. It has a great location - across the street from a monorail station, and a couple of blocks from Las Vegas Blvd. It has a full kitchen. We had a two bed room where the one bed and one washroom are up the stairs in a loft. (Would really work for two couples willing to share.) The downside is that the decor had clearly seen better days, TV remotes didn't seem to work right, and the air conditioning made the room cooler but not comfortable (it was 117F/47C outside). Staff was friendly and very service oriented but what was with the old cigar on top of the fire alarm outside for the two days we were there?</p><br>Convenient and Comfortable<p>We picked this location since we were attending an Expo at the LV Concention center. The hotel is directly across the street and about a 5 minute walk. It is also directly across from the Monorail.

Pluses:
- Rooms are decent
- One Monorail Stop to the Strip
- Good sized rooms, quiet
- Access to some exerccise facilities at the Courtyard next door

Minuses:
- Tough to get a cab here
- It is a bit worn but not overly so

It definitely worked for us location-wise - If you want a casino-free place to stay itis a good choice. Easy access to the strip, convention center etc</p><br>Great Place To Stay With Pets!!<p>Because the big hotel/casinos on the strip do not allow pets, I thought we were going to be stuck in a 1-2 star motel/hotel for this trip. So we are very grateful for the Inn and felt the place was very clean and satisfactory. The breakfast buffet met our expectations.

In our opinion, we felt the reviews commenting that Inn was outdated and needed new furniture and carpet was rather harsh. We've stayed at the Venitian, MGM, Ceasars, etc (without our pets) and can say that the Inn has already adjusted their prices accordingly. I can honestly say that I would rather stay at the Residence Inn with our pets than any other place.</p><br>Old &amp; Dated!<p>Hotel felt tired, dated and worn. The room we stayed in was depressing, dark and felt dirty (despite decent housekeeping service). Clearly no updates have been made since construction in the sixties.

At this point, the best option for the new management team would be to completely renovate (if not tear down) the rooms. Years of neglect, decay & stale smoke have taken their toll. Lipstick on a pig cannot disguise what this place has become.

On the positive side, front desk staff were friendly & pleasant and I did like the garden layout of the units. Not up to usual Marriott standards however!</p><br>no frills, nice room<p>If you want to stay off strip this is nice. very nice room. quiet area, near the aerial tram</p><br></body></html>
