The hotel was very clean and rooms were nice. Unfortunately the beds were very hard and uncomfortable. There were only 2 towels in the bathroom, and no hand towels. Breakfast is pretty skimpy, however they offer 20% off at the ihop across the street.</p><br>not good<p>The only thing you had for breakfast was cereal and toast. There was no roll away bed as promised for my son. Theres only one elevator in the whole hotel and its very slow.
It smelled like Marijuana on the 4th floor. The sheets are very ugly. There brown and not attractive at all. We had a hard time with our keys not working. I will never stay at a howard johnson again in my life..</p><br>excellent<p>This was a nice property to stay at. The young lady at the desk was very knowledgeable and helpful. Certainly made us feel welcome.</p><br>Value for Money<p>If you are going to Vegas and have a car to drive around (to the Strip, Downtown, etc.) this hotel is not a bad choice. It is around 15 minutes from the Strip but, for a busy weekend, it is inexpensive and good value for money.

The evening/night staff was much more courteous than the morning one. We wanted an early checkin (1 PM) instead of the usual 3 PM and even though there were rooms available, the morning staff refused. We ended up going around Vegas and checking in at midnight. Since, none of the regular rooms were available, we got upgraded to a bigger suite at no extra charge.

The room was surprisingly good - nice, fresh and clean. The bathroom was not huge but, adequate. Breakfast in the morning was standard fare but, it was decent.

If you book early enough (a week or, so ahead of time), you can get a really good deal on the hotel.</p><br>Nice place to stay<p>Quiet place to stay. Close enough to the strip, but away from the noise. Check in was great and the receptionist was very friendly. Room was more than expected with a stove and fridge. Breakfast items went fast, so not many choices when I got there, but the staff was helpful in making sure I had something. Would stay there again</p><br>Great Hotel at a Great PRice<p>I was pleased with my overall stay. My children enjoyed the fridge and the microwave. My only complaint would be that the bed was a little hard and I woke up kind of stiff but that's just me. My son said he got a great nights sleep on his bed. There was an odor of cigarette smoke on the elevator which was slightly bothersome and my children witnessed a gentleman smoking on the elevator at a different time which displeased them. Otherwise we were VERY happy with our stay and if the hotel were more centrally located would be highly likely to stay there again.</p><br>The room was good for the price and for having a...<p>The room was good for the price and for having a kitchenette. The beds are short. My daughter, who is 5'10", had her feet hanging off the edge.</p><br>Great hotel close to LVMS<p>Nice, clean hotel very close to the speedway. Comfortable beds, clean rooms plus a fairly decent free breakfast.</p><br>Our room was very clean.   The staff were friendly and...<p>Our room was very clean. The staff were friendly and helpful. We were very surprised when we showed up and found that the small kitchen that was advertised had absolutely nothing in it. Not even a fork,pan or nothing. We went downstairs and acked if we could get a pan of even some glasses and were told no. How can you advertisement a kitchen and expect your customers to bring all the pans, silverware ect. in orde to use it. Very disappointed!!!!! We ended up spending $45 aqt Walmart just so we could prepare the items we had brought.</p><br>Hotel was great.  The hotel personel was wonderful.  The...<p>Hotel was great.
