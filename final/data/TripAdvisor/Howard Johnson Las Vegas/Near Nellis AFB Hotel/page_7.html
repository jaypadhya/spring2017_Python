<html><head><h3>Howard Johnson Las Vegas/Near Nellis AFB Hotel Reviews Page 7</h3></head><body><br>Clean, good features for price<p>I stayed here one night while passing through Las Vegas on my way north to Utah. The hallway was secured by a door key reader, and the room was very clean with quite a few extras like a full-size refrigerator/freezer and stovetop. It would have been a bit cramped for more than one person and only had a double bed, but the size was fine just for myself. My only complaint was the noise level from the floor above me, which would have been a problem had they not stopped the circus act before I was ready to sleep. Free breakfast was nothing special, but the hotel offered a 20% discount at the IHOP next door for anyone interested. It's also very close to the AFB, a hospital, a Walmart, several other restaurants, and it has easy access to I-15.</p><br>Ok but need..<p>This hotel was ok. The staff was very nice but their is only one elevator for four floors and it gets very long waiting for it. The signs by the elevators need to be redone as they were falling apart. MY Biggest COMPLAINT with this hotel is my family of four was passed out from traveling from Seattle and at 1am they checked in someone above us and they started jumping off the beds and such. Woke all of us up eventually and it ruined our night of sleep. Called the front desk and they didn't call the people to remind them that others were sleeping the front desk clerk said can you give it 20 minutes as they just checked in. You could hear things in all the surrounding rooms also.</p><br>uncomfortable<p>I looked forward to my stay at the HJ Hotel, however the beds are extremely hard and uncomfortable i had an experience with the noise above me didnt get any sleep. When i reported it to front desk i was told that she could not call every guest to find out where the noise was coming from. She also told me there was no one above me. And did nothing! As a matter of fact she was rude.
And i did not get the rate that i saw online. I paid more.</p><br>Clean &amp; Reasonably Priced, but Unpleasant Room Odor<p>The room was very clean and the price was reasonable, but when we entered the room, it had an unpleasant odor. I eventually got used to it, but my wife never did. She said she suffered from nausea all night long. Eventually, she turned up the air conditioner to run constantly throughout most of the night. She said the chill and loud noise of the constantly running air conditioner was better than suffering the full brunt of the unpleasant smell. Although the rooms have kitchenettes, which may sound like a benefit, the rooms must not vent very well because the morning hallway had a strong, stale bacon smell, as well. If everyone on the floor were cooking in their room, it would probably be similar to living in a restaurant. Like other reviewers noted, the mattress was economical and firm. No pillow-top mattresses here. The neighboring IHOP Restaurant provides a 20% discount for motel guests. This motel is great for travelers looking for clean, budget lodging (two descriptive words which do not always go together in the motel industry), but if you have a sensitive sense of smell, I would recommend you look elsewhere.</p><br>Decent<p>This was a last minute check in. The room was affordable and clean. I would have preferred different sheets since they felt itchy. I liked that this place had a laundry room open 24/7. Decent enough just to sleep but not somewhere I would want to stay for more than one night.</p><br>Dated but very clean<p>We stayed at this location for the Nascar race so the location was a priority. Our GPS took us easily to the hotel but signage is poor so it took some time to find the door to check in. The hotel is well secured, required the door key to swipe in. The staff were pleasant and gave us coupons for the IHOP which was next door. Ate at the IHOP the first morning, filled out the review on the receipt giving us a free stack of pancakes the next day. The hotel hallway had dim lighting and the room was very dated so I was a bit leery at first. However I checked the room over really well including cabinets, the beds, etc. and could not find one speck of dirt or any unwelcome tiny guests. Its obvious the owners and cleaning staff take great pride in this hotel. My biggest complaint were the beds which had old fashioned low and hard mattresses. The price was low which it reflects the decor and uncomfortable mattresses.</p><br>Really clean and affordable<p>This Howard Johnson's was clean, comfortable
The employees were helpful and nice.
Nice place to stay.</p><br>Visit to Las Vegas<p>Our visit to Howard Johnson, Nellis, NV was satisfactory in all respects, except for one. I resent and have deep concern that the hotel staff required and made photo copies of my credit card and Drivers license. This is a flagrant violation of my personal and private information.
If there is any instance that my data is used to steal from me, or damage my credit, be assured I will sue you and your company for all I can.
Sincerely,

When we went to have breakfast there was nothing left except cold cereal.</p><br>Vegas Trip<p>Room was fine, staff was very polite. Location suited our vacation agenda.
Would recommend it to anyone.</p><br></body></html>
