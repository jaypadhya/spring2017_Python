The only thing I saw missing is you do not have Bell Boys to help with the luggage.</p><br>hotel looks brand new, very quiet, great value, and very friendly staff<p>the staff really does make the difference. dealt with someone from each shift at least once, every time they were very friendly and helpful. only drawback for this property is the keyed entry into the building. no one can come up to your room (like family or friends, or even pizza delivery) without my having to go downstairs to greet them. other than that, excellent. great breakfast and onsite laundry helps too.</p><br>my stay<p>Didn't if there was a pool at location or not. But over all my stay was Great. Everything was close. Great location.

Thank You!!</p><br>Best stay in The United States so far!<p>A great place to stay if you're just passing Vegas. It's situated right outside Vegas and is therefore cheaper than staying at the Strip. The room was clean and the right size. There was also a kichenette but bring your own cutlery and pans if you have the desire to cook something. It also had a microwave and a big fridge with a freezer. Bathroom was clean.

Free wi-fi and parking is provided. The hotel also provides a room with a couple of gym equipment and a laundry room. We took advantage of the laundry room and paid a total of 4$ for the use of the washing machine, dryer and to buy some detergent. The laundry took an hour and a half to be done.

The star of our stay was the breakfast. I am not much of a fan of sweets as they are usually offered for breakfast by many hotels so I was pleasantly surprised when I saw that Howard Johnson was offering cream cheese spread Philadelphia. It really made my day! They also had butter, peanut butter, honey, jam, a variety of cereals (all of the mentioned packed in 1 portion servings), all sorts of bagels, different kinds of muffins, apples, oranges, 2 kinds of milk, 2 kinds of coffee, hot chocolate and about 6 kinds of tea.</p><br>Stayed one night<p>No swimmingpool, no lamps close to bed, bed was too short for me (I am almost 2 meters), light in our room was very white.
Clean room and bathroom.Very friendly staff. Breakfast was ok√©.
It was good for one night.</p><br>Attended the Slow pitch mens softball World Series and...<p>Attended the Slow pitch mens softball World Series and selected this hotel for our stay. It was clean, economical and worked out great. The staff were very friendly and helpful. Would be happy to stay again.</p><br>Excellent for a North Vegas/Nellis Stay<p>This hotel was clean, the staff was friendly and I felt secure staying here with my teenage son. The room was a little on the small side, but DID have a full size refrigerator/freezer, cooktop and kitchen sink. We needed some special accomodations during our stay and the staff WAS willing to go out of the way to help. Check-in and check-out were BOTH fast and efficient. The shower had plenty of pressure and the shower head was at a good height where I didn't have to kneel to wash my hair (this is an issue and many hotels when you're 6' 4" like I am).</p><br>Didin't regret my choice<p>No nuisance noise problems. Had an armoire instead of a closet. Had laundry room, iron and ironing board. Coffee maker, fridge, microwave. Everything was clean. Places I've been staying had bathrooms that were falling aprt, this one was fine. I've had better and worse breakfast, they had cereal and bagels and muffins. Sharia at the front desk was helpful, so nice. The ice maker worked, I've been to places where it didn't and one that charged. The towels were typical motel rough thin. the TV had HBO. There was no nightstand light though. no pool. You get a discount at the IHOP across the street. There is a fitness center with a treadmill and a cou</p><br>Review of our stay<p>The room was clean and neat and functional. In no way could it be described as luxurious but it was not spartan either. It has the normal amenities, cable tv, a/c, wardrobe, iron and ironing board, hairdryer, clothes basket and laundry facilities downstairs. Heck, it even has a small kitchenette. Because it is so close to Nellis and serves the military, it is perfect. The only 'complaint' I would have is this: The mattresses are extremely firm. On a scale of 1-5, with 5 being the highest, I would rate it a 4. I like a firm mattress, it helps my back. My sister, on the other hand, not so much. My only suggestion for improvement? Ice and vending machines on every floor would add convenience in the middle of the night if a 'snack attack' should come upon oneself. The employees were nice, friendly and helpful and I really enjoyed the 20% off IHOP across the street due to staying at the Howard Johnson. Thank you.</p><br>Howard Johnson Near Nellis AFB<p>I have stayed here twice now, about 3 weeks apart, and I have been very disappointed. Both trips were for 4 nights. On both occasions I had to call the front desk for service. No one ever came to service the room. On my current stay I called the front desk asking about service & was told someone would be up. 30 minutes later I had to take my dirty towels to the front desk, was given towels and told there were no wash cloths, they were in the washer. Makes me wonder how many other rooms did not receive service. I don't think I will stay here again any time soon.
Room Tip: Stay somewhere else. Super 8 is right around the corner.
