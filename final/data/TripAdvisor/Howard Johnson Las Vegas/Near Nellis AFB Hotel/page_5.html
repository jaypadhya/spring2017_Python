There was some confusion about our booking and she helped us get into a room with two beds and a roll away. It was a great location for the event we were attending. Felt secure and was clean.</p><br>Good Value<p>Just outside the strip area a few miles, near Nellis AFB. Clean and friendly, free breakfast. All rooms have small kitchenette. Good price and nice rooms, quiet area. Under New management, better organized and staffed. I will return.</p><br>Very basic, pool would have been nice.

Area a bit sketchy, 24 hr Walmart across the treet is a bonus.</p><br>Great Price<p>We went down to Las Vegas Motor Speedway & after much of searching & comparing I booked @ this hotel.
Bad Things~ A bit out dated & NO fans in the bathroom &shower pressure was not strong
Great Things~ We had a kitchenette ~ Full Size fridge & freezer, Stove Top & microwave. They have firm beds w/ soft pillows. Small BUT nice tv w/ MANY channel options. I liked the FREE parking & the ice machine being on the main floor.
It is a continental breakfast BUT if u need more~ IHOP is across the street & walmart is a hop & a skip away.
Front Desk was Very Friendly & Accommodating :)</p><br>Great hotel<p>Great place everything was up to standard and beyond .the room was very clean and the room had a flat screen tv. The bath room was very clean the hotel location was a quiet place .very reasonable price</p><br>Very Clean!<p>We got stuck in Vegas the day I-15 washed out In Moapa. Checked in via price line. Great price for this hotel. The rooms looked like they had just been remodeled. Bed was only a double, and not super comfy but it was ok. Had a kitchenette in it but didn't have any kitchen ware. No problem for us as we only needed it to sleep for 1 night. They had an ok free breakfast. cold cereal, bagels, bread, muffins, juice & coffee. Room was very very clean!!!.
Room Tip: North end of Vegas, away from Vegas traffic. Close to Race track.
See more room tips</p><br>comfortable stay<p>The room seems to have been recently renovated. The carpet was clean and new. The bed was a little hard, but I slept well. If needed I would stay again.</p><br>excellent value for money<p>very pleased with the amenities and the size of room, Guest services were pleasant to talk to. considering the fact that it had kitchen the price paid was excellent value.Only gripe would be the weird chemical smell as soon as crossed the lobby into where elevators are . the parking lot was well lit and gated with fencing all around which was a big relief, The locations seems far from the action but for us we dont do back and forth to the hotel. once we go to the strip we hang around till 2 am and then come back for the night . If i am ever in the areas i may consider staying here again. One suggestion i hope the management pays heed to is to provide medium to slimmer sized pillows for those of us who dont like sleeping with our heads up in the air or those with neck problems the pillows were too thick</p><br>Good<p>The staff was great the place was clean & the price was good. My only complaint is the neighborhood.</p><br>It was not too bad. The location is not that safe and...<p>It was not too bad. The location is not that safe and service could have been better. Elevator took forever and it slow.</p><br></body></html>
