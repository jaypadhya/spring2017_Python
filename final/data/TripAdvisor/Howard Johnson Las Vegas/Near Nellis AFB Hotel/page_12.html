Very clean.<p>The hotel was ok for a few days outside of the strip. The rooms were clean, although mine had a lingering smell of smoke (probably because I stayed on the smoking floor). The safe was big and roomy and had a cool little sound effect when I armed it. The beds are small, but I had no problem sleeping diagonally. It's a short walk to the Walmart and bus-stop. The laundry machines can be a bit tempermental, but the front desk is closeby to help out. The discount on the ihop accross the parking lot came in very handy. Most tour companies will not pick you up this far out away from the strip, just as an FYI. The neighbourhood is clean, but for me, it was a bit dodgy. I was not overwhelmed with a feeling of safety outside the hotel grounds walking around solo. Given that Vegas has over 100 gangs, there is an inherent risk staying in North Vegas. All of that being said, the hotel itself is a safe choice as they've just erected a fence surrounding the parking lot. The funny thing about this place is that you have a full kitchen (stove, cupboards, etc), but no utensils or pots/pans. The microwave in the suite was all you should need. It's not at all as bad as the bad reviews make it out to be. Stay here, but keep your eyes open walking around this part of town.</p><br>Good stay for the value<p>I was able to get a double full beds in a nonsmoking efficiency for $35 a night. What enhanced the bargain was the cleanliness, friendliness and professional can-do attitude of this staff.</p><br>Great customer service<p>Gil provided wonderful service and advice on the area. Las Vegas is not the safest city, but for a necessary trip, this wast a great experience.</p><br>The rooms are clean and the staff was freindly.  Good value...<p>The rooms are clean and the staff was freindly. Good value for the low price. The bed is too stiff and pillows are too thin but all in all pretty good for the price.</p><br>Clean &amp; Cut<p>I needed a room on the spot. The closest one was either Aviation Inn or Howard Johnson. I had already lodged at Aviation Inn before, so I thought I should give HoJo a try!
The font desk clerk showed an unprecedented effort to find me a deal. He ended up giving me 15% courtesy discount. The best part was the room was super clean and cozy, being one of the best deals I ever got for a room!</p><br>Would stay again!<p>We really enjoyed our stay. Quick easy check in. Front desk was very friendly and professional. The room was very clean and had been recently remodeled. The bed was comfortable, but a little short as I had read with other reviews. Luckily, I'm short so it wasn't a problem for me. Not far from the strip, just head south on the I-15. I definitely would stay again.</p><br>Great for the price!<p>This was my second stay at this facility and again, I found it to be a very clean basic hotel with lots of extras for the price. Room included a sofa bed/seating area, refrigerator, stove top and microwave. The free "breakfast" left a lot to be desired but there's an IHOP next door that offers a 20% discount if you are a hotel guest. The hotel is located in a less desireable part of town (near Nellis Airforce base) but there's a fence surrounding the property and safety was not an an issue. My only complaint was with the beds. They are the smallest "double" beds I have ever seen and a little too hard. But all and all for a short stay the price can't be beat.</p><br>What a dump!<p>I figured the place wouldn't be a Taj Mahal but it was awful. Even my service animal refused to sleep in the bed with me and I'm fearful of taking some unwanted friends home after two uncomfortable nights. The lighting sucks - either too bright or too dim and no bedside lamp - and the water pressure was minimal at best. I left towels for reuse but the maids cleared everything after the first night and replenished nothing!
Spend a little more and stay someplace real - I sure will next time I need to be in this area.
