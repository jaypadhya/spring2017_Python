<html><head><h3>Howard Johnson Las Vegas/Near Nellis AFB Hotel Reviews Page 1</h3></head><body><br>Never save to stay here<p>I should have stayed at my go to hotel in Vegas, the Cannery (just down the street)! I thought I would try saving $20 and stay here, I mean how bad can it be since the Airforce and families use it? Staff was friendly and the good stops there! First gave us a smoking room that the beds were not made. Changed rooms to a musty non smoking room. The shower was barely a trickle and with long thick hair, I need pressure! The breakfast and staff there in was horrible. I've stayed at many hotels with breakfast included and by far this is the worse. Absolutely no selection. I'll never stay here again!</p><br>Average hotel<p>We got a room for two nights through Hotwire. They called this a 3 star hotel. It is more like a two star. It looks more like an extended stay place with a small kitchen in our room. The did have a laundry room, a limited fitness room and no pool. The breakfast area looks like they took two bedrooms and and made them into a food area and dining. Very small. There were two beds in our room that were doubles that were very hard and uncomfortable. I would not choose to stay here again.</p><br>Pleasant overnight stay<p>This is a very affordable hotel on the outskirts of Las Vegas. It takes 20-25 minutes drive to go to central Strip. Clean and quiet rooms, bored front desk manager, free (very simple) breakfast at few tables (will be crowded) and free internet. There is even a kitchenette in the room with the fridge, hotplate, microwave, counter.
Room Tip: If you can, get the room not close to the elevators. There is only one and crowds can wait and chat...

We even called the hotel ahead to verify the safety of the place. When we drove up the long street up to the air force base we didn't see anything "rough" as people had told us. The parking lot is fenced from the streets and the rooms cant be reached without an keycard. The check in personel were surly or tough, maybe because we called ahead ? The room was clean and had wonderfull hard beds ! I love those beds because I have a very bad back. The shower had low waterpressure but was clean. There is just a small tv in the room, little desk to work on and breakfast was, how can I put this politely, under standard. The area is way too small and cut in two by the corridor. The is just mini muffins and hot tea and coffee. It was not kept clean very well either. If breakfast was better they would have scored a 3,5</p><br>Good location for races<p>Good location near Vegas raceway. Wal- mart across street and the best Mexican restaurant just a few blocks away. Viva Zapatas is a must!
Raceway is only 5 minutes away and downtown Vegas 15 minutes away.
Kitchenette rooms is great for longer stays.</p><br>No ups-No extras<p>The hotel is a little hard to find because it faces a side street. Our room was clean and comfortable. Very good price. Breakfast was OK at best. Nothing to do there (if there is, no one told us about it). Nothing to do outside. No chairs, grass, or shade. It a basic place to stay. I think all the rooms are about the same. About 10 minutes from the STRIP by car or rocket ship. Car is slower but easier to find parking.
Room Tip: I think they are all about the same

Staff was nice with lots of advise were to go and see the sights. Huge parking lot.</p><br>Would not recomend this place<p>Found 2 large cock roaches in our room within our two day 3 day stay. Told the front desk in a respectful manner and her reply was "there are cock roaches in Nevada." Well duh there are cock roaches in every state but i'd prefer them to not be in my room. The continental breakfast was three types of cereal and dry bagels. Spend the extra buck and go to a comfort in or something because that was an bad experience for my first stay at a Howard Johnson.</p><br></body></html>
