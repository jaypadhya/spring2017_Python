<html><head><h3>Howard Johnson Las Vegas/Near Nellis AFB Hotel Reviews Page 4</h3></head><body><br>Nice price!<p>For Las Vegas outstanding price and value. Rooms have kitchens and full size fridge. Room was clean and nicely decorated. Breakfast selection was adequate. The 3 on location truly depends on the reason for your stay. If it's Nellis AFB then 5 stars, the casinos 3. When entering the property go the the building on the right to check-in. The other building has the check-in sign but is not Howard Johnson. I would definately stay here again.</p><br>Unsanitary<p>There was a god awful smell on the first floor...that reeked of cat urine..I complained to the manager and front desk but I was told multiple times that no one knows where it is coming from and i was told that the hotel is not pet friendly but im almost positive that its animal urine that I smelt. And the breakfast never had any milk,creamer,or cream cheese and when asked I was told there wasn't anymore and this went on for days. The bottom line is that I would not recommend this hotel to anyone looking for comfort and cleanliness</p><br>Great time at HO JO's<p>everyone was friendly & made the stay great. Having a kitchenette with a fridge was fabulous, as well as the continental breakfast, great idea.
Thanks to all.</p><br>Beds are very hard.<p>Rooms are clean. Double beds are firm, and were uncomfortable for me. When our cards to the room didn't work we went to the front desk, and although the front desk person fixed our cards never spoke a word to us. However the next day the same front staff was very friendly. Breakfast was basic, although the chocolate muffins were good.</p><br>Clean but tiny<p>I was really disappointed with the size of the "one large bed" at this hotel. It was less expensive for a friend and I to get one bed, versus getting the room with two, so we opted for this thinking it would be a king size bed. The bed was a full-size mattress and our feet hung off the end of the bed. It was harder than sleeping on the floor. I will give it to them, the hotel is very clean, but the staff is rude and I couldn't get over how tiny and hard the bed was.
Room Tip: Make sure you know what you're actually booking and don't plan on the continental breakfast...

I stayed for 2 nights and was happy with the price and conditions.</p><br>great room and great price<p>The room was clean, comfortable, convenient, and overall a great stay. The desk service was helpful. The only negative I can say is that the elevator was a little slow.</p><br>Stay Pleasant<p>Room was nice. Price reasonable, One desk clerk needs additional customer service training. She was like dealing with a rock with a bad attitude. I plan to use the same motel next year for the same trip.</p><br>The Hotel was of good value and met our needs.  The area...<p>The Hotel was of good value and met our needs. The area was questionable but OK! It claimed to be smoke free but the hallways reeked of smoke the whole time we were there!</p><br>Air Force Base<p>The room was perfect! Great bed and great amenities, quiet and clean. Near a couple of nice restaurants and very nice movie theater.</p><br></body></html>
