Clean, modern, breakfast with variety, easy to get to off I 15. Would definitely stay again.</p><br>Won't Stay Here Again<p>The issue I am complaining of is that all I asked when I checked in was that I have the upper floor level cause I am a disabled veteran and have issues with constant nuisance disturbances. Especially since I am in the midst of relocating out in Nevada, I just requested a little peace and quiet while I have an extended stay so I can focus on the relocation process. I was told that the room that was picked for me was on the third floor but stated that would make a notification to not reserve the room above mine for anyone, especially not a temporary stay guest. Well, almost two weeks into my stay here and that didn't last long. Instead of renting other rooms that were available, they decided to interrupt my stay and reserve the room above mine with noisy guests at that. I also had an issue where I requested to not have housekeeping disturb my room cause being that I'm relocating, I have alot of personal sensitive information with me and I don't really trust anyone regardless of staff. The rep at first stated that she would honor my request and then the following week, she stated that it was requirement. I don't actually believe, because all housekeeping did was change my linen which I was already in the process of doing. Then another incident, on my way to the gym, I stopped by the front desk to pay for the following week and receive the bill receipt. Whilst in the gym, a janitor walked by and decided to stop in the gym to look at my private hotel bill receipt...I was completely flabbergasted. Also, every time I stepped outside, I felt as though I was being stalked by the management. I would never stay here or recommend this property. I was completely uncomfortable my entire stay!</p><br>soccer tournament<p>Overall good stay..the microwave didn't work in our room so they put in another one that had hair on the pillow..did not like that but everything was cool..I would stay there again...one other problem was the beds were extremely small..my husband and I did not get the best sleep</p><br>We got what we paid for.<p>We got 50% off and got 50% service. Asked for towels and they made us come get them... continental breakfast was poor... We found a moldy muffin. The people were pleasant and nice though.</p><br>Better than expected<p>This is a nice hotel near Las Vegas. It is worth the savings to be off the strip if you do not mind a short drive on the freeway. My only complaint was a very firm hard bed for my wife but I did not mind at all.</p><br>Aug. 2013 Vegas stay at Howard Johnson<p>We've stayed at Howard Johnson in Nellis A.F.B. Nevada. We chose this Howard Johnson over the one at the strip because the photos of the hotel and rooms looks cleaner and newer. We were a bit apprehensive but once we get to the hotel.....the photos were right. The building and room looks new and very clean.</p><br>Very dissatisfied<p>First, there is only 1 elevator for all the rooms on the 2, 3, and 4 levels. Ice, vending, laundry, and the Continental Breakfast is on the First floor. Rooms are very small. Bathroom shower didn't have any pressure, water trickled out. We missed housekeeping being that we were still in the room getting ready for the day, so I called the front desk for housekeeping to come back and was advised to check if housekeeping was still on the level and let them know to clean the room. So I did and even tipped her on the way out because she was next to my room. When I got back my room was not serviced. I notified the front desk and all they said was sorry and that she doesn't speak English only Spanish. Well I speak Spanish, but as a guest I should not be the one to have to hunt down someone to service my room. Anyway I advised the front desk of my extreme dissatisfaction to no remedy. So for me, I will never stay here again and not recommend anyone else consider staying at Howard Johnson.</p><br>Bravo HoJo<p>This place is clean, well maintained and has the friendliest staff. The room comes with a full frig, stove top, sink, micro, cabinets (no housewares), small flat screen TV, closet with safe (no extra fee), A/C , separate table for laptop. The breakfast offered better quality cereals, o.j., muffins, bagels and "real coffee." The laundry room has quite a few washing machines and dryers. There is no pool but it has a good fitness room. This hotel is very safe and within walking distance to a Walmart. There are restaurants such as Applebee's and Olive Garden within a few miles. This hotel is far better than any other HOJO I have ever stayed at.</p><br>Awesome customer service and clean.<p>The beds are full size and so this seems to be why they are the talk of the post, while higher end hotels have a queen or a double (a bit larger). However, the room was clean and fresh, with a nice kitchenette (no housewares). The location has key card entry and walking distance to IHOP and Jack in the Box. Check in was smooth and painless. I requested items when I booked and the clerk acknowledged and accommodated my request before I even spoke (A+ for that). The only irritating thing I could say would be that someones cooking encased the hallway (it didn't smell to appetizing).
Room Tip: if your staying a while and wanna save by cooking meals in your room, bring necessary cook and eatin...

They need to add a bed stand light. The beds were some of the firmest I have sleeped on. I would stay here again.</p><br></body></html>
