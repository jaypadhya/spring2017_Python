<html><head><h3>Howard Johnson Las Vegas/Near Nellis AFB Hotel Reviews Page 8</h3></head><body><br>personnel<p>The hotel is in a great location for arrving military personnel, but to vist the strip or othe areas down town not the best location</p><br>visit<p>This hotel was priced and located to our benefit. The beds were really hard and this made sleeping difficult.</p><br>Clean, Basic, Poor Staff<p>We arrived in the evening. One has to guess that the unmarked entrance is the main entrance. The address is there, though the entrance does not face the street on which the address applies. There is no sign indicating Registration or Welcome. I thought it was a side entrance for guest already checked in. After driving around, I realized it was the only entrance. There were three people at registration. None welcomed us. One was eating muffins. One was typing. One was looking at the other two and explained that they were in the middle of shift change. The two sitting down, muffing girl and typing guy, began a conversation about who would check us in. Nothing was communicated to us as we stood there waiting. Both started to check us in. We had two rooms, so muffing girl decided to do the second room while the other did the first room. Unfortunately, they were not engaging in a cooperative conversation and muffin girl couldn't get an answer from typing guy as to which adjacent room to assign. Eventually typing guy assigned both rooms. The rooms were clean and tidy, but the beds were rather uncomfortable. Rooms include a two-burner stove, cupboard, and decent-sized refrigerator: may be a good option for someone staying in town for a week or two. The "free breakfast" was bagels, muffins, coffee, and juice. The floor show was one employee talking very loudly to another employee about her current illness and antibiotics. I do not believe we will be returning.</p><br>Friendly and Clean<p>We stayed here only because it was close to the Race Track. The staff was friendly and helpful. I was remembered by name from making my reservation. Our room was clean except for the left over sandwich in the fridge.

Breakfast included with our stay was minimal, cold cereal, muffins, bagels, juice and coffee.

The room costs for 1 night with the NASCAR race in town equivalent to the normal week stay.

Last minute reservations supply and demand.</p><br>Overnite in Vegas<p>We stayed one nite at the Howard Johnson near Nellis Air Base in North Las Vegas. Pleasant experience. The bed was a double and the room was small, but as we knew that would be the case we were happy. It was clean, with a good TV and internet access. Our clerk was friendly and helpful in finding a place to eat. We enjoyed our one nite stay.</p><br>Vegas NASCAR weekend races<p>Our stay was everything we expected!! I knew that I would get my monies worth!!! Planned this trip to Vegas NASCAR in November and your being conveniently located near the motor speedway this was perfect!!!! Couldn't have planned it all any better!! Thank you so much!! Smitty</p><br>Not the Howard Johnson I was Expecting<p>This is an absolutely terrible Howard Johnson. The focus of the business here is weekly rentals, not overnight stays. In the room above me there must have been a family of 5 living in the hotel. The fixtures are completely out dated, no swimming pool, not at all the level of service or comfort I expected from Howard Johnson. Avoid this hotel at all costs.</p><br>Good hotel for LVMS<p>Reasonable hotel if available at $50-$70. Probably not worth too much more. Stayed for two nights whilst at Las Vegas speedway. Discount given for IHOP next door. Few other fast food services close by. Noisy due to sleepless child in nearby room but this would apply at any hotel. Fuss free stay.</p><br>Outstanding service<p>Basic room, beds, etc which were OK, if a bit pricey. Breakfast was very minimal (I'm being charitable). Nice touch to offer a deal at neighbouring IHop. Desk clerk went out of her way to offer tourist suggestions and directions.</p><br>Best kept secret in North Las Vegas...<p>The Howard Johnson 5300 East Craig Road, Las Vegas, Nv 89115.
I have been missing the hospitality in L.V. Seemed like not as many smiling faces and then I make a call to a gentleman named... Chris Bridgeforth.
at the H.Johnson . Now trust me...I don't take the time to write many of my experiences even though I'm on the road most of the year.
Any way...I explained our needs, rooms and amenities request and we all drove over there. Not more than five minutes, and we walked away after shaking hands. We all kinda looked at each other and the money man said: Wow!... It was like they were waiting for us to get here...We all finally found out he did have a sense of humor after all...LOLLL. Free Breakfast... 20% off some of the res truants in the area and a I-Hop right outside the entrance to the hotel. Plenty of R,V. parking and big trucks. Which is behind a locked gate. Chris thank you so much. Our 2 week stay has turned into a month now and has been like the good ol' days in Vegas. We now have 8 rooms total and to my SURPRISE not one complaint from anyone on my team. That's a first...loll I must give Chris a BIG! Thank You again my friend...and the Staff that makes this Hotel run like a well oiled machine...
A special thank you as well...
