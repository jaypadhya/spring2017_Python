The complimentary breakfast was horrible, crammed into a dinky dark room, the only thing hot was the coffee, thank goodness for that. Very small counter space with one 4-slice toaster , actually not much room for anything. Other hotels at least have make your own waffle machines, so you can have something hot. I asked an employee where the waffles were and was told next door at the Ihop, and got laughed at. One employee was there loading a dish full of bagels and muffins 6 high, and then hogging the only toaster with guests waiting four people deep. The three seating tables were crammed into another dinky dark room across the hall. Guests were waiting at least an hour to get a bagel and a place to sit. By 8am guests were lined up down the hall-way waiting to get there shot at the toaster. I know the breakfast is no extra charge, but I never had any this bad at other hotels. For this reason I won't be staying there again.</p><br>4/25-26 trip<p>While bed and all surfaces were spotless clean, housekeeping needs to vacuum around the edges of the carpet more carefully-there was gravel material along edges of carpet. They need to THOROUGHLY clean the floor around the toilet, as there was a funky smell like someone had missed the toilet. Sleep was terrible - Friday nite there was a lot of thumping around upstairs. Saturday night, people directly upstairs from me got into an argument, and someone STOMPED around, shaking me out of a sound sleep THROUGH earplugs, at 1:45 a.m. and I had to call the desk and have them do something. People quieted down but by then damage was done - it took forever to go back to sleep. NOT good - they should have been forced to pay for my room that night. Not Howard Johnsons fault, but they should institute a policy in writing that if you wake up another guest you have to pay a fine, and that guest should get a free night.</p><br>A bad place<p>Bed was hard and uncomfortable. Room smelled. Shower had no pressure. Location was not in a good location felt very unsafe.</p><br>Very nice hotel<p>The room is great! Two beds, a safe-deposit box, a mini kitchen and a good bathroom. The breakfast is very american. I'm from Brazil, so I don't like it so much, but that's ok. Unfortunately it is far from the Strip, but it explains the accessible value. I liked the hotel very much.</p><br>Hairy bed<p>Horrible! When I pulled the sheets back there was hair everywhere. I went down to the front desk to tell the clerks and they never even apologized... They did however, hand me some fresh sheets so I could remake the bed myself... If Howard Johnson was still alive even he would stay some place else!</p><br>a kind staff at the front desk<p>The hotel charge was reasonable. In addition, the staff named Chris was really helpful. She kindly helped me find the directions to an office in Pahrump and some other places. After my business meeting, I enjoyed visiting at Red Rock Canyon Park thanks to her advice.</p><br>Easy Stay<p>I've stayed at this HoJo a few times before. It's a great hotel. Unfortunately, its not in the best of neighborhoods. However, I've never felt worried about my things.</p><br>Stayed 3 nights but my room was only serviced once. I got...<p>Stayed 3 nights but my room was only serviced once. I got in late and didn't want to bother with it.</p><br>We were covered in bed bug bites!!<p>I never write bad reviews but I feel I need to warn people. Super rough part of town. People barged their way in when we used our key. No pool, mediocre breakfast, staff aloof. But worst of all is we woke up covered in bed bug bites that seriously ruined the rest of our trip. It was awful!!</p><br>WHG Annual Conference<p>We decided to go to Vegas a few days early before our WHG Ramada conference at the Mandalay Bay hotel. The hotel was nice and clean the rooms are new and have everything you need like being at home. Staff was friendly and attentive. Thank you</p><br></body></html>
