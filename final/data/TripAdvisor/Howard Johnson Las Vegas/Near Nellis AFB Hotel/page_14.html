<html><head><h3>Howard Johnson Las Vegas/Near Nellis AFB Hotel Reviews Page 14</h3></head><body><br>Wish it was as good on the inside as it was on the outside.<p>The outside of the hotel gives the impression you will have nice accommodations. However, once inside the staff lacks professionalism and the basic knowledge to run a hotel. There was only a single entrance requiring a key card which limits visitors. The rooms are very small and kitchenettes are not even stocked with a single plate or fork. The double bed was so short my feet hung off the end, and the bedding is a sheet and a blanket as thin as a sheet. The water in the shower didn't work, neither did the internet despite several phone calls to the front desk over the course of two days..</p><br>Nice people.<p>Computer problems made check-in very difficult, but staff handled it well. Thanks to Sharia & her boss.</p><br>disapointed<p>Was sposed to have two beds only had one, one had to sleep on the floor each night !! All n all had a good stay. Might be back but will ck around first.</p><br>Great stay<p>I was surprised how nice this room was, given the low price. Everything was clean and new. Free wifi, coffee maker, nice kitchenette in the room, new and effective air conditioner/heater, great black-out curtains. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The only thing I would change is the lighting: it was kind of ugly, blue florescent. But the everything else was perfect!</p><br>New Year's Eve<p>This was a nice place to stay. The staff made me feel welcomed and safe. The place is very clean and well maintained. The beds and bathroom are a bit small. I am 5'6 and my feet hung off the bed. The toilet looks like it was built for Webster. Other than the small facilities, it was a very comfy place to stay. The breakfast was great!</p><br>Great hotel, very clean, and great price!<p>Arrived for a three night stay during new years. All hotel personal were really nice and helpful. The room was fully equipped from a private safe to a full size fridge and stove. Complimentary breakfast was limited however you could take as much as you want. The location is about 10 miles from the strip. Be okay to pay taxi serivces with tax and tip about 40 if you want to visit the strip. Overall, very quiet and relaxing. Absolutely great place to stay. I would recommend to stay here.</p><br>Value for money on Craig's Road<p>We went late in the day to ask for a room. They offered a full size bed room for $ 55. Few other similar hotels in the neighborhood were asking $ 85. The room was clean with a kitchenette, full size refrigerator, a GE microwave and flat screen TV. It was good night sleep. The breakfast was good too. The parking lot of the hotel seems to secured. Highly recommend it, if you want to make your own dinner for the night.
Room Tip: Our room was on the ground floor (104-114)

The place has a bit of security prison looks (glassed lobby, etc.) but area felt very safe for the family.

For the price I got on the web, there was no way to beat the deal. Rooms are brand new and tastefully decorated. Pillows were bit soft and small.</p><br>Fun and Cheap<p>Great price and clean parking available without any headaches close by to restaurants and services and easy drive to airport.
Very good for families and price right.
Management is good and very clean rooms. Helpful front desk employees.</p><br>Nov. 1 - Nov. 5 Stay!<p>The price and quality of my room was great! The orange juice I had with my morning breakfest was not to my liking but with that said I plan on staying at this Hotel again in the near future! The racer rate of $59 a night was awesome too!</p><br></body></html>
