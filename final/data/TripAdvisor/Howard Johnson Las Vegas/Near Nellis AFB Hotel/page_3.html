<html><head><h3>Howard Johnson Las Vegas/Near Nellis AFB Hotel Reviews Page 3</h3></head><body><br>Not a place to stay. Rough area of city.<p>check in was behind glass another room. When we were coming & going we were shoved to the side from people wanting access to the hotel as u had to have a key to enter the building. Spoke to desk clerks & they were not concerned that these people did not have keys and were barging over us to make sure they got through the keyed door.
Room was very poor for a Howard Johnson especially for the price we paid. why do they advertise kitchen room when there isn't even a bottle opener available in the room. No dishes, cooking stuff or silverware,
Breakfast - go out in eat. They cereal was even stale.
If you need to stay in Vegas - stay somewhere else or keep on going.

.
Room Tip: Get a top floor. The floor between rooms very thin.

Imagine my surprise and delight to find this to be a reasonably quiet, very comfy, yet economical place within a brief drive from the major Interstate highway through Las Vegas. One can get anywhere on the strip or area with minimal effort and time. I'd stay there again when visiting the area.</p><br>Clean, Secure and a SupoerStaff whats not to like?<p>Thanks guys it was an eat 2 night stay, clean all functional rooms even with a big fridge and burner stove top.
I even like you local security patrol, because the neighborhood is really not the best.
A big shout to Betsy, she check me out and help me tremendously on Sunday morning.. you ROCK!!!

Cheers,</p><br>Howard Johnson Las Vegas<p>Was in Las Vegas for NASCAR weekend but wife ended up in the Air Force Hospital for the weekend. Called Howard Johnson on Craig Blvd and was quoted aprox. $148.00 foe 1 night. When I arrived and showed my military ID the room rate dropped to about &64.00! It was a very stressful week-end for me because of my wife's emergency and Howard Johnson helped relieve the stress with their great customer service</p><br>Front desk staff was great.  Room was clean, but not what I...<p>Front desk staff was great. Room was clean, but not what I expected. Bed was too firm, room look cheap. Only two towels were provided for two persons, no hand towels provided. Neighborhood was creepy and in a bad part of town. Howard Johnson's used to be a name that meant quality, if this hotel is an example of what the name has become this will be the last time I stay at Howard Johnson.</p><br>housekeeping<p>2nights at this hotel and no body clean my room, l report.the problem, Jose says (sorry l can't do anything is late and no body can clean you room) first day the housekeeper entry to my room but she dont knock the door and lm change my clothes, this 2 problems l.report immediately.when l.back to.my room in the night to Jose, really.lm not happy</p><br>Simply Sweet<p>We had a good time. Room was clean but the bed was a bit on the firm side for me. The front desk was kind enough to give me extra blankets to padden in up a bit. The breakfast was fresh .... would be nice to have waffles for kids (and grown up kids) the staff were AMAZING. they all spoke English well and were very friendly...especially the lady that did the breakfast room from 6-10 am. The only complaint with breakfast is they packed it up before 10 am. if it is open till 10--my opinion is that everything should be out and available till then. Overall a great visit.
Cari</p><br>Don't expect much, esp. zero from the managers<p>The ONLY thing positive was the staff at the desk was nice. Very nice. They got me toothpaste when I left it at home. However, the kitchens had NOTHING in them. Not a single piece of silverware, not a bowl, not a pan, NOTHING. And yet they didn't think it was necessary to mention this ANYWHERE. So we had to go to walmart and buy everything for a week. Don't call it a kitchen if there's nothing in it. SECOND, I left $100 worth of equipment in the room and called the next day. They said yes, it's here (again they were very nice), and I offered to pay in full to have it shipped to me. They said, we'll have a manager call you. No call. Had a funeral to attend and wasn't able to try again until Monday 9 days later. I'm on the phone with them now getting the run around. No one but the front desk gal seems to care, and of course, she doesn't know anything. She is trying to transfer me to managers but I keep getting hung up on.
Room Tip: Low price if you can bring all of your kitchen instruments with you and don't want any service.

The room was very clean when we arrived, the only problem I had was with the bed. The beds are not good for sleeping unless you like a bed that wont bend when you sit on it. The mattresses were way too stiff and I always woke up more sore than when I laid down. Other than that, great place to stay, the breakfast is usually mostly gone around 9 so if you want fruit be up early!</p><br></body></html>
