<html><head><h3>Howard Johnson Las Vegas/Near Nellis AFB Hotel Reviews Page 6</h3></head><body><br>Pleasantly Surprising<p>So as the title of my review states, I was pleasantly surprised by the facility. My boyfriend and I were going to go to Las Vegas, but not being 21, it is incredibly difficult to find a hotel in Vegas that will allow you to check in if you are not 21. Since we were more interested in the Hoover Dam/ historical aspects of Vegas than the gambling anyway, we decided that staying on the strip was not important to us, especially not important enough to pay the prices of the 1 strip hotel that would allow us to check in.

We got a little nervous when we saw the area the hotel is in, coming from the south. But once you get within 2 miles either way of the hotel, it is a fine area, and I never had to worry for my safety.

When we got there, the front desk people were absolutely lovely. They were friendly and politely interested in our itinerary for the stay. The room itself, while the bed was small, had a full size refrigerator, stovetop, and even had the same microwave my boyfriend has in his home. It was clean and the AC worked amazingly.

If you are looking for the more historical experience of Vegas compared to the stereotypical one, or if you are bringing children with you, this is a great place to stay.

PS, if you show your room key to the people at the IHOP next door to the hotel, you get 20% off.</p><br>Great value<p>Great value for money. Not close to the strip but easy to get to. Clean and quite, staff were friendly and accommodating. Small kitchen in room was an added bonus.
Breakfast was pleasant with plenty enough for us.
We would stay again.</p><br>Very Good<p>Everyone was wonderful, friendly, courteous, helpful. The only thing was the bed mattress's were quite hard. And they only made up one of the 2 beds. Otherwise we were happy with the room. Thank You</p><br>HoJo quality in N. LV<p>Very nice, very clean....Love the kitchenettes! Some of the reviews almost scared us off...Ignore them....We travel a LOT & this place is fine! Good security, friendly personnel....Acceptable light breakfast....</p><br>Some things were non-applicable. The room was comfortable...<p>Some things were non-applicable. The room was comfortable and sufficient. Staff was friendly but check-in process was very slow.</p><br>Overcharged<p>Two others in my group received senior discounts when I asked for it at check out I was told that my rate was locked in the system and I could only get that rate for the last night. Not the other 6 nights I had stayed there. A good hotel would have a way to adjust their billing system.</p><br>Will not book again<p>Where do I start? Checking in went smooth. Both gentlemen at the counter were very nice. When we got to our room, that's where the list begins. The bed was horrible, very uncomfortable. Carpet was dirty, the shower hardly worked, and I doubt it was cleaned because we went out and the soap I used the night before, was still there when we got back after house keeping supposedly came in to clean. There was an old filter in the coffee maker. I'm a coffee drinker and I had to wait till we got to the strip to buy my coffee instead of making it in my room. Proof the house keeping staff does not check everything like they are supposed to when cleaning a room. We accidentally left food from Ihop in the fridge. It's probably still there.</p><br>Great Value for Money<p>This was my first stay in Howard Johnson and I was impressed. The hotel was great value for money. I was with my family of 3 and got an accessible room nearby elevator. The room had a sofabed - good enough for my kid. There were ameneties like fridge, microwave, kitchenette which were least expected. The breakfast was ample with bagles, muffins, juices, cereals and coffee and variety of teas. The bed and room airconditioner was very comfortable. Will stay here again if get a chance.
Room Tip: Accessible room on 4th floor next to elevator is a good room and was quiet one.
