<html><head><h3>Residence Inn Las Vegas South Hotel Reviews Page 4</h3></head><body><br>Fantastic staff, good location but some noisy rooms<p>I spent four weeks at the Residence Inn and the staff were first class. The location of the property was pretty good too, with regular shuttles to the Southern end of the strip leaving every half an hour. The last shuttle returns at 1.00am, so there's an inbuilt safety mechanism for those who may get a little too tempted by the slots.

My first room was on the second floor facing the freeway/airport and was really noisy. The traffic wasn't too bad, but the helicopter arrivals and departures made sleep a challenge.

I was upgraded to an inward facing suite on the ground floor which was quiet, except for the noisy elevator. If you can secure a ground floor room that doesn't face the freeway/airport and isn't next to the laundry or elevator then go for it.

The Residence Inn is a great little property with excellent staff in a pretty good location. Get the right room and you'll have spent your hard earned money wisely.</p><br>Inexpensive Alternative<p>I have been booking my stays at this hotel anytime I have a convention at Mandalay Bay (which has been for a few years now). They run complimentary shuttles to Mandalay every half hour. It's a great alternative as I don't have to hear the slots and deal with the smoke of the casino to get to my room. The complimentary breakfast and evening appetizers are a bonus.

The hotel is clean but some of the furniture has seen better days although for the amount of time spent in the room it is fine.

I will be back again in March.</p><br>An average Residence Inn<p>Our business trip to Vegas happened to overlap CES and there was nothing else to be had so we booked here.

Positives:
Excellent and friendly staff.
Easy access to highway if you have to travel anywhere off the strip.
Good breakfast.
Shuttle to the strip (although the Mandalay stop places you a long walk from the casino or mall)

Negatives:
In the flight path of McCarran so you here the planes about 20 hours out of the day.
In need of an overhaul, carpets were dirty and worn.
Somewhat of a sketchy area.

If you like having a kitchen in your room and are a Marriott rewards customer looking for a decent rate you will like this place. If you are used to a step up, beware.
Room Tip: For the quietest room (still hear planes) choose the B building and a room ending in 35.

The staff in this hotel was exceptional for the price point they operate in. From the manager who emailed us to propose an upgrade change to the kitchen staff who prepare a nice breakfast buffet there is a prevailing attitude of going the extra mile. Wow. Accommodations were adequate. Beds were great. Sofas were worn however. No complaints except they're located close to the strip but in an industrial area. I'd stay there again to visit family!</p><br>Great and quiet location <p>Very friendly and helpful staff. Our room was very clean and well taken care of. Beds are very comfortable. Would highly recommend to anyone. Good location to highway and airport. Also close to the Silverton casino.</p><br>Great hotels for your family<p>Nice location (close to the airport, strip and major highway I-15)
Breakfast is ok.
Very clean and quiet. nice parking space. I see no issues at all with this hotel.
Kitchens are small but ok.
I would recommend this one.
Room Tip: get a corner room. usually located in between utility rooms. There is a huge electric transformers r...

This stay was very typical, our room was clean, the staff was helpful, and the breakfast was good. The staff was quick to deliver a toilet plunger in the late evening when one was needed. We did notice air traffic noise during our stay which is typical for the area so if you are easily bothered bring ear plugs. We would stay here again. We needed to be close to the Vegas strip to attend a show but it is perfect if you do not want to stay at a casino. Parking was no problem. The pool area was nice but we didn't swim.</p><br>Nothing but Praise<p>We based ourselves at the Residence Inn South for our first-ever week in Las Vegas and it proved to be a great choice. . . ideal, in fact. First, the location is super convenient, just off the Strip. There is a regular shuttle service to resorts on the strip every half hour, but we had a car, so it took only five minutes to get to a couple of the evening shows. There is similarly a Whole Food Market and other shopping within a 5-minute drive so it was very convenient.

The property itself is clean and well-maintained, with very friendly and accommodating staff. Front desk staff Cristal, Michael and Gerry were particularly helpful with any questions or requests. We had a suite with a very comfortable bed and (5) pillows. We're fussy about that and found the bedding very satisfactory. Returning there at the end of a hectic day, it was nice to be away from the glitter and noise of the Strip.

A real plus to this accommodation is the complimentary breakfast provided every day. Not just a few muffins, fruits and dried cereal . . . but a full hot buffet breakfast with scrambled eggs, bacon or sausage rounds, potato wedges or pancakes, oatmeal, as well as the usual juices,yogurts, fruit, bagels, muffins, toast, etc. Complimentary hot buffets and fresh salads are also offered several weekday evenings a week. We wound up eating out only a couple of times all week, saving a fair bit of time and money for other pursuits!

We'd choose to stay there again in a heartbeat, and will recommend it to anyone we know who's planning a Vegas visit.</p><br>Perfect.<p>I know this type of hotel will not be for everyone, but if you really need a full kitchen, this is the place to go.

Off the strip, so no parking problems. Daily full service maid service, free wifi and parking.
Free complete hot and cold breakfast including waffle station room, sausage, biscuits, eggs and a bunch of other goodies. Best I've ever had at an extended stay.

Comfy bed and pillows were outstanding.

Highly recommend this!</p><br>Clean, Comfortable &amp; Friendly<p>Checked in late on a Monday to a friendly smile. The room was very clean and comfortable. Checked out at 2:30AM this AM. Bill was ready and there was fresh coffee in the lobby. This is a great off-strip property... They are paying close attention to their service and property.</p><br></body></html>
