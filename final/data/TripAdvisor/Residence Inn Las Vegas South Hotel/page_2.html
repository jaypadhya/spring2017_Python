<html><head><h3>Residence Inn Las Vegas South Hotel Reviews Page 2</h3></head><body><br>Quiet and peaceful hotel minutes from the Strip<p>This hotel is great for those who are traveling with family or children and for those that want a break from the nonstop action on the Strip. The hotel is right off the strip. If you take Dean Martin Dr. to Hacienda Ave. you'll be in the self-park lots of the Luxor and Mandalay Bay in under five minutes and you'll have completely avoided the traffic on the Strip. The hotel is well-maintained as is the pool. The only downside for some people may be the need of a car to move around since there aren't any casinos or restaurants within walking distance but that wasn't a problem for us. There's free breakfast, free parking, free internet, and a free shuttle to the Mandalay Bay and the Aria. After being on the Strip and downtown all day, this hotel was great to relax, unwind, and recharge. Whenever I'm in Vegas again, this hotel will be at the top of my list. You may not get the spectacular views that some of the hotels on the Strip have (our rooms had a view of the pool which wasn't bad at all), but you'll get a lot more bang for your buck if you stay at this hotel off the strip.</p><br>Spacious suites<p>We stayed in the 2 bedroom/ 2 bathroom suite. It was more than enough space for my family. The breakfast was great!! The shuttle took us to the Mandalay Bay as well as to the airport.
The rooms were clean and the hotel was very quiet.
Overall, I enjoyed my stay!!</p><br>Nice stay with family!<p>Me and my family stayed at this wonderful hotel for our 1st time. I was really happy with it overall. The 2 bedroom suite was perfect for me, my wife and our 2 kids. The breakfast was decent and plenty to choose from. We usually like staying outside of the strip, but yet close enough to grab a shuttle. Except one day we had a small issue with the shuttle since it had no space and we had to wait a while for the second one. Other than that, the service was great! I would recommend it for families or just couples.
Room Tip: I would suggest getting the shuttle that leaves you Aria hotel, I think?? rather than the MGM. Much...
See more room tips</p><br>GREAT<p>Been here for 5 weeks now thru the construction of the lobby and some of the rooms. It has not been as bad as a lot of the negative reviews that have been posted. Staff is outstanding had a room I did not like and was changed when I requested it. The only dinners/supper what ever you call it is very lacking from the Management side. Popcorn, pretzels, chips are not a meal.
Room Tip: stay away from the front rooms by I-15
See more room tips</p><br>Oasis off the strip<p>If you come to Las Vegas to see the casino's and want a nice clean comfortable place to unwind after gambling and/or watching a show, then the Residence In Las Vegas South is just the place to consider. The hotel has been renovated. The rooms are clean, the beds are comfortable and the breakfast buffet will get you ready for a fun day of adventure in Las Vegas.
There is a complementary shuttle that will take you to two locations on the Strip and will even take you to the airport.

Front staff is friendly. .
Room Tip: 2 bedroom suites are nice and don't cost much more.
See more room tips</p><br>Hopefully construction over<p>Nice property. Gold Marriott member and they put me in the renovation section. New paint, cloth covered elevator.
Their evening reception serves no wine or beer.
They did relocate me to lower level( do not care for at all)
They did give me some points
All in all worth another visit!</p><br>Noisy poor location<p>We are regular patrons of Residence Inn because we need a kitchen due to our child having severe food allergies. I was EXTREMELY disappointed with the location of the hotel and condition of the room. The hotel is located in the take off path of McCarron airport, so we were awakened every morning at 5:30 am from jet noise. To top it off, there was some truck backing up at 6 am from the power plant next door. The "view" outside is of the ugly power plant.

As far as the room, the toilets all had some problems with VERY LOUD flushing sounds.

They didn't have any breakfast trays so we had to take several trips to bring food to our room, so that we could all eat together with our child.</p><br>Had Issues With Our Stay<p>My rating should have been higher for this hotel but we had issues that were unacceptable.

The hotel is located not too far from the strip. There is a free shuttle over to Mandalay Bay and the Aria. We used it a couple of times and works well. We also had our car with us so used that a lot. There is plenty of parking around the hotel complex (there are 2 buildings). The reception/breakfast area is in another building so you have to walk outside to get to it.

We had a corner room on the top floor of Building A. We had a view of the strip and I-15. The room was a good size and had everything we needed for our stay. The bed was comfy, the shower had great pressure and there really was no noise level (had the AC going most of the time which drowned out anything outside).

The issues we had:

1. The fridge was not making ice so we had to call for maintenance to come up to check it up. Someone had turned the water off (which it should not have been). Maintenance was up quickly and even got us ice in a bag until the fridge started working. This may not sound like a big problem but at 46 degrees outside, you need to cool off your drinks, especially when just arriving.

2. The AC was so loud when it came on. Way louder than I have heard others (I think we had our own unit as it was in a closet close to the bed). There was a horrible metal rattling when it came on so I had to get maintenance up again to fix it. They did so the rattle was gone but beware, the AC is still loud.

3. The breakfast area was under construction when we were there. Not a big issue except for the fact that the first day the workmen were working around us while eating breakfast. Not good. The worst part of the breakfast area is that it is way too small. There was never enough tables for the amount of people staying at the hotel. One day we had to eat outside in the heat (not a good way to start the day) and one day we had to take our food back to the room because all tables were taken (even the ones outside - a few were eating by the pool). There is room for more tables so I am not sure why they don't have more. On the Saturday that we were there, they actually ran out of food and people were in line waiting to get more (hot food), bread was low, no yogurts, no coffee lids. Two ladies were on staff that day but they could not keep up with anything. Not sure what was happening, but be prepared if you are there on a weekend.

4. The area of the building we were in had bugs. We are not sure what kind they were but we had them in our room. The day of our arrival we found one, second day we found more, third day even more - next morning I found a couple walking on the bed. That was the end of my patience. I killed them and took them to the front desk. I told them I wanted this dealt with. We were moved. It seems that there was an issue in our area of the building with bugs. I would have thought that they would have called an exterminator in right away but was told that he was coming the following week and would look into it then. When I reported the bug issue to the lady at the front desk she took the bugs and went to speak to the manager. She then came back and told me about how they were going to look after us. She apologized for our issues - I would really have preferred that THE MANAGER come out to talk to us about this. I was very disappointed by this.

Besides the issues, we had a fairly good stay. We were there for 5 nights. I have stayed at Residence Inn a few times and normally enjoy them. I wish they had the same guarantee as Hampton Inn. Not satisfied with your stay, then your stay is free.
Room Tip: We stayed in room 400 which is on the 4th floor and is a corner room in Building A. You face the st...
See more room tips</p><br>Off the beaten path....<p>In Vegas that can be a good thing, but I just didn't like the location at all. Couldn't put my finger on it, but I don't think I'll be making reservations here in the future even though there was nothing wrong with the hotel. Jasmine at the front desk was exceptionally helpful from a customer service standpoint and our room was clean as well as the common areas. No construction noise or early airplane noise as others have mentioned, so no complaints there. I guess the worst part was getting back and forth to the hotel. Both Tropicana and Warm Springs Roads, the primary routes to and fro, were extremely congested each time we left and came back, which was one of the reasons for booking this property-to avoid the congestion. I know this is out of the hotel's control, which is the reason it still gets 4 stars, but if I have to deal with traffic I may as well stay on the Strip (which I probably will).</p><br>SKIP Residence Inn LV South If You Want an Enjoyable Stay - and Avoid Paying for Happy Hour<p>Not only is there construction/renovation in the Lobby and Breakfast/Happy Hour Areas which are very noisy while you are trying to enjoy Breakfast, but Management is not helpful or hospitable. The Breakfast food is removed before the 9:30 a.m. end time and this Property makes you pay for the Food Truck they have as their "Happy Hour" (now renamed "Mix"), Even though as an Elite Marriott Rewards Member for many years - I called ahead asking for early check-in and they did not have requested room ready until after 3:00 p.m. To use Fitness Center, you must travel to another Property. Outdoor noise is bothersome due to lack of good insulation. This Property is not well managed based on the thousands of hotel stays in my long career. Skip this one. I am strongly considering changing my loyalty from Marriott to another Brand, especially after this Property's experience.
Room Tip: Ask for Pool View to help avoid noise
