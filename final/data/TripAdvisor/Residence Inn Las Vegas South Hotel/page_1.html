<html><head><h3>Residence Inn Las Vegas South Hotel Reviews Page 1</h3></head><body><br>Girls' Trip<p>Five of us went to Las Vegas to celebrate my sister's 60th birthday. Unfortunately, we chose the weekend of the Rock and Roll Marathon to go and room rates on the strip we're running $250 to $300 per room, and with Las Vegas fire codes we need two rooms. The two bedroom suite at the Residence Inn was perfect for us. The free breakfast buffet had plenty to offer and saved us money on food. The shuttle that ran until 1 a.m. give us easy access to Town Square and the Strip. The staff was very accommodating, especially Gerry who went above and beyond to meet our every need. If you are taking the shuttle on the top of the hour, be aware that it may be going to the Mandalay Bay or Aria, or both, so be very specific with the drivers as to which drop off you are looking for before you get on the shuttle. While the shuttle service is complimentary, you should be prepared to tip the driver.</p><br>Spacious rooms and polite staff !!<p>Being Mariott Platinum member, I booked two nights at this hotel for my parents during Labor Day weekend and intend to use it a second property since we were staying at Cosmo for most of the time.

The staff is excellent and the rooms are spacious and very clean. They upgraded us to a huge two bedroom suite which was very nice !!

The breakfast spread is very nice in the morning and is recommended if you are on a tight budget in Vegas !!







Very</p><br>Family Vacation<p>Stayed at the Residence Inn and received a 2 bedroom and they accommodated my sister's dog Chloe. They even had build your own ice cream sundae on Thursdays. They complimentary breakfast is delicious and offer variety.</p><br>Just as expected<p>Offers an experience expected that off a Residence Inn. It is inexpensive, not too far from the strip. It has free internet and breakfast, and a laundry room. Housekeeping does their job well, and reception is friendly.</p><br>Off the strip, but then a shuttle every 30 mins till 1 pm in the night<p>i like this place...free shuttle from 7 am to 1 am in the night. (thats like 18 hrs of service). nice...

Free snacks in the evening for all guests ..i loved the tacos...nice breakfast...

the only thing is its off the strip and often ppl tend to stay at the strip after 1 am. so the cab ride back costs u about 15-20 USD.</p><br>Surprisingly good<p>Not expensive, spacious rooms and great staff at the front desk. Redecoration was happening during our stay, but that never bothered the guests. Breakfast was wonderful, and the free shuttle service to the strip a nice bonus. Great place to stay if you want to keep away from the crazyness of the strip, and yet experience Vegas.</p><br>Okay place, good for airport stays.<p>Difficult to find, must have a gps or good map. Good for an airport stay, but absolutely nothing within walking distance. If one were staying longer in Vegas plenty of other places to find that don't have a casino in the lobby, where one could walk to restaurants. Hotel was okay, not one of the nicest Residence Inn's I've used. I got the feeling it's used a lot for family reunions, etc. Elevator extremely slow.</p><br>Clean, quiet, non-gambling hotel off the strip.<p>Stayed in May, and they were doing renovations, but didn't feel any disruptions from this. We stayed in very clean two bedroom, two bath suite which was very roomy. Had a living area with small dining table & kitchenette in between the two rooms. Biggest complaint was that the "decorator chaise/sofa" was very awkward & uncomfortable to sit upon. Accepted our dog without any problems. Free breakfast. Ate a good dinner at restaurant at the Marriott Courtyard next door. Shuttle service was offered, but we did not use. Could hear some highway noise & smell the diesel fumes when you went outside, but not too bad. Off the strip, but good hotel for long term stays or people arriving who are not into the Vegas gambling strip hotels.
Room Tip: Away from highway.

Never once heard anyone in the halls or from the other rooms super quiet. (And there were lots of kids here) Yes you can hear the planes take off but every thing great about this place made up for that didn't hear them after a day or so. had a great stay here for 7 days absolutely no complaints july 30th till august 6th. Thanks for the hospitality will be back, love the Residence Inns we're sold
Room Tip: Upstairs overlooking the pool (you'll know when u can have it to yourselves)

I stayed on Saturday 8/1/15 and arrived after midnight. My fiancee and I were greeted by Eyob, front desk agent. He was so welcoming and asked if it was our first time in Vegas. It was my fiancee first time. Eyob gave us information on the area and when I sad I didn't want to go because it was late and we had to check-out early, Eyob intervened and offered a late check-out so we can go to the strip and not worry about getting a few hours sleep. I thought that was was so kind and genuine of him to do. After we came back, of course, I left my key in the room, and he asked how everything went and was excited for us that we had a chance to go out for the night and gave us suggestions on other things to do.

The only complaint is housekeeping knocked on the door twice the next morning (well once, the first time they knocked and the second time, they just came in) and woke me up both times so we wand up leaving around 11:30am so we didn't get to sleep in after all.

Thank you Residence Inn for a great first night experience in Vegas.</p><br></body></html>
