<html><head><h3>Residence Inn Las Vegas South Hotel Reviews Page 7</h3></head><body><br>long term stay<p>Good for long term stay if needed. Breakfast however runs out of food, (eggs) an hour before breakfast is supposed to be over. Nice they off food items a couple evenings midweek as well. Hotel is what you expect in a Residence Inn, halls, stairs, etc a little worn probably because dogs are allowed. But hey we need hotels allowing dogs! You will hear the airport take-offs and arrivals pretty clearly but luckily that doesn't go on during the night!</p><br>Great staff, good room and the right price<p>Customer service is paramount to me. The Entire hotel staff from the moment we arrived, until the time we departed (two night stay) was superb. Two front desks clerks greeted us, along with the general manager of the hotel. All were exceptionally friendly and helpful. From letting us choose the location of our room (4th floor facing pool), to inviting us to the evening's cocktail hour, to offering great advice on getting free & close parking to our show that evening (Jersey Boys at Paris Hotel)...the customer service was gracious and personal. Our room was clean and nice with extra pillows as we had asked for when booking. Our location was quiet and peaceful, even with what appeared to be several high school volleyball teams staying at the hotel. The breakfasts were terrific, with fresh fruits, eggs, juices, toast, bagels, waffles, pastries, sausage, yogurt, granola and more. The general manager waved me over to ask how our show was and if the driving/parking recommendations she gave worked out. Wow. I've stayed at Four Season's and Ritz-Carlton's that didn't have such attentive hospitality. Great location, close enough to the Las Vegas strip without actually being there. Easy travel all around the city since close to the freeway. Highly recommend this hotel and thanks to the General Manager for running such a wonderful Inn. A hotel's staff is generally a reflection of their management/leadership team.
Room Tip: I read several Tripadvisor reviews and followed their advice. 4th floor facing courtyard/pool. No no...

It's an excellent choice for this, or for a general visit to Las Vegas. This hotel is quiet, very comfortable, and the staff is friendly and helpful. Despite its proximity to the Interstate this hotel is very quiet. This is an excellent way to escape the insanity of Las Vegas. I'll stay here again when I'm back in town.</p><br>Wonderful hotel and facilities. Extortionate $100 pet fee.<p>We had to shoot to Vegas at short notice for a business meeting on a Saturday (yup, great timing!).and didn't have a reservation or want to drive around checking out too many places. After a few false starts we arrived at the Residence Inn and it was perfect. Lovely courtyard, nice (enough) surroundings, lovely rooms, great facilities, super free breakfast etc.

And pet friendly. However I thought the clerk was joking when she said "$100 non-refundable pet fee". I really did a double-take and asked her again, twice. (NB: My wife and I have driven all over the US and Europe with our dogs and encountered many great pet-friendly places, as well as many pet-unfriendly ones too. So we do have a lot of experience at this.) So the $100 seemed to be true and she was extremely unbending about it. We had no choice and little time so we bought it and enjoyed our stay and our business meeting, the great room, fabby breakfast and lovely surroundings.

I don't know what the concensus is out there but I felt compelled to review this place and let you know. Most pet-friendly motels across the country - and there are a growing number of them - will accept your dogs etc with no charge. Some ask for a refundable damages deposit and some will take a non-refundable fee in the region of $20-ish. Not nice but acceptable if you're in a hurry. But I've never encountered anything like this $100 fee to have your dog stay with you in a hotel. I mean $100 bucks?! Even if it had been dressed up as a "cleaning fee" or something similarly ridiculous there's no way any company could justify $100 as an expense.

By the way I'm also a Marriott Rewards member of a couple of decades and a lot of travel, not that it made a blind bit of difference. I do plan to send a complaint to Marriott but since the fee is their stated policy I don't expect any change out of them. But please, reasonable people out there, what is the problem?!!

Again, fantastic hotel, couldn't recommend it highly enough, but dictionary-definition "unbelievable" pet fee.</p><br>Disappointed for Residence Inn, can be noisy<p>Not bad, but one of the more worn out Residence Inns I've stayed at. The other big issue is the noise level. If you have a room that faces Dean Martin or Oquendo, be prepared for a lot of traffic noise. I had to move to one that faces into the courtyard. That was a big improvement and hardly notice the traffic after that. Probably would try somewhere else next time. Overall, unless you're a Marriott person, I'd recommend the Staybridge Suites a few doors down. The rooms were a lot nicer, breakfast as good or better, and about the same price when I've compared. However, the Staybridge exercise room needs some repairs to the machines.

Service: Spotty. Waited a long time to check in and again for various questions (I was there 10 days). Reported a broken TV on the exercise bike on day 1 and it was still broken on day 10. And I reported it 4 times. Once I was told that it was marked as fixed. Not. Also needed to ship a package and finally gave up and drove 15 min. to a UPS store. But generally the staff was friendly. Just seemed like they had a lot of new people who didn't know where things were.

Room: big like most Residence Inns, but just getting worn and dated. For comparison, I stayed at Residence Inn in MD recently that had stone (or faux stone) countertops and stainless steel appliances in the kitchen. This had a laminate counter and old appliances. It works, but definitely not as nice. Internet speed was decent, but did get slow at times.

Bathroom: Again, worked OK, but dated . Strange thing was that the water seemed soft the first several days (slippery after a shower) but not at the end.

Exercise room: decent machines, each with a TV, but bike TV never worked. Room was a little hot. No headphones if you forgot yours and ran out of wipes 3 times in 10 days and I had to ask at the desk. But the machines worked fine and the variety was decent.

Breakfast: Hit and miss. Some days they had good fresh fruit, others it was canned. Seemed like the weekends were worse. Always had bananas, but green ones some days. Breads were just average. Not good, but not plastic wrapped.

Location: at the southern end of the strip. It would be a long walk if you want to wander the strip. It was good for me because I was working at the convention center in Mandalay Bay which isn't so far at all to walk (maybe 10 min).
Room Tip: Pick a room that faces into the courtyard or be prepared for loud traffic noise.
See more room tips</p><br>Nice place near the Strip<p>Not bad at all. Was there just a week and a half of a 4 week stay. Breakfast is very good real food not crap from a box. The dinners several time during the week weren't bad either. Noise from planes wasn't really noticeable at all. Shuttle to the strip, Ney York, New York and another hotel is every hour. It's close to the highway if you know how to get there. Ask the staff. And the Staff was very friendly and helpful. Room was comfortable and the kitchen was very useable.
I'd stay again for sure. On the rating gave Room Service Very good and Spa Very Good. There is no room service and the SPA if there is one I didn't use. All in all it was Very Good.
Room Tip: Nothing. It's close to everything you need.
See more room tips</p><br>Very Pleasant Facility<p>Though not walking distance to The Strip, The Residence Inn provides shuttle which made it totally worthwhile to stay here. The studio was very clean, spacious, and well designed. Breakfast was well prepared and with enough choices that it should be sufficient for most travelers. Staff during breakfast was friendly and helpful. Overall, a surprisingly pleasant stay considering that it is in Las Vegas. The studio was actually better than the more expensive hotels rooms on the Strip.
Room Tip: We had the corner studio on the 4th floor. Very quiet..

As was the the case with the other inn I had stayed at on the other side of Las Vegas, Las Vegas south was my home away from home this time during another convention I attended this time at the Mandalay Bay convention centre. It really is great to get away from the casino hotels with all their hustle and noise and enjoy a peaceful evening in these condo style-house units. With their almost full kitchens, separate living rooms and bedrooms, nice bathrooms etc. I really feel at home here. Heck, the beer is always cold in the fridge, and the cable on the flat screen is great. Everything was spotless and very well kept, the staff were very friendly also. There isn't much around the Inn to see or to eat. The inn offers free shuttle service to a couple different stops on the strip and also to other areas where you can shop or eat. The shuttles come around every 1/2 hour and the drivers are very accommodating...You really save tons of taxi money...The Residence inn is a very good hotel option for families or guys like me that are in town to work. They offer a nice free breakfast and some special hot theme snacks in the mid afternoon. Try them out, you will probably be back......Like me.....
Room Tip: They were all basically the same...
See more room tips</p><br>Great Location and excellent service<p>Had my group staying for 3 nights the past weekend and everything was great. The facilities are well maintained, the staff always helpful and breakfast had great variety and really well prepared.

The location is also a plus. You have your car parked a few years from your room, cutting of time that you may need to leave a big hotel/casino. Also, the street the hotel is located allows you quick access to virtually any point in the street without the madness of the strip's traffic. Everything was very convenient.
Room Tip: You can save money if you have around 5 people by getting a 2 bedroom suite
See more room tips</p><br>Home away from Home Hotel<p>The Residence Inn Las Vegas South was a perfect place to stay. Like a home away from home. We really appreciated the full kitchen and excellent accommodations. The location for this hotel was close to everything and it was super clean. Breakfast was perfect every morning and the evening social with complimentary hot food was super good. Their swimming pool and outdoor space was beautiful and relaxing in between all there is to see and do in Las Vegas. This hotel was a great place for our stay. If I didn't have a home and a family to be with, I would be happy living here for good. Definitely would go again.</p><br></body></html>
