This hotel is away from the strip but close enough if you still want the strip experience. Hotel provides courtesy shuttle to the strip several times daily. Love the "home-like" kitchen amenities which are great if you bring along the kids! Also offers free breakfast which is nice. This hotel is very clean, has attentive staff and very quiet rooms. Not sure what a previous reviewer named Doug K. meant by "airport noise" because the whole time we were there we never heard an airplane fly over not once!! Perhaps the airport changed the flight path?? We never even heard any traffic noise...To sum it all up we had a great,quiet and relaxing time and we will definitely return again soon! :)
Room Tip: Rooms in building "B" are in a quiet location on the property. Prefer the first level...

Everything else was good, not exceptional, but good. Room was clean; however, A/C was noisy.</p><br>Better Options In Las Vegas<p>I’m a Marriott Gold Rewards Member and I’m very loyal to the brand. I’ve stayed at a number of the Marriott properties in Las Vegas and this is my least favorite so far. Primary drawback is the location – it is away from the action of the strip and is isolated because I15 runs between the hotel and the Strip – there are no restaurants in walking distance. However, they do offer a complimentary shuttle that runs every half hour to Mandalay Bay and NY NY. The property is almost directly under the takeoff path of the airport so noise from the planes is a constant throughout the day – sleeping-in is difficult due the extensive airport activity in the morning. The exterior of the property is fairly nice and somehow appears to be more modern than the rooms. The pool area is very nice, however they could use more lounge chairs. By dinner time each day the pool area became a bit messy – no clean towels, piles of dirty towels, and trash about. The pool needs more attention during the day. The rooms were very large – furniture could use a refresher though. Bed was outstandingly comfortable. Climate control seems to be an issue in the rooms – heard a number of people complain that AC was inadequate and that was certainly the case in my room. Temperature in the room rose throughout the day as outside temperature rose and the AC could not keep up even though the curtains were closed. Front desk admitted AC is an issue on some rooms on western/southern side of the property. All things considered, there are better options in Las Vegas.
Room Tip: Rooms overlooking the pool offer a nice view (sure beats the highway or parking lot). Rooms with sou...

They were very friendly & helpful, which seems to be the (pleasant ) norm at a Residence Inn. What we found that wasn't advertised is that they offer a free shuttle service to the convention center, the Strip, and to be dropped off at the airport. The website says no airport shuttle, probably because they don't offer pick up, but if you want to drop off the rental car early you can still get to the airport.

The commercial area meant it was loud with truck traffic - even through the night. Be careful of rooms by the road. The area. Doesn't lend itself to road running, but they have a good exercise room with treadmills that actually work!

The breakfast buffet was well stocked - a solid place to stay.
Room Tip: Rooms in the "00's"are going to be fronting the road and louder.
See more room tips</p><br>Convenient, Very Friendly<p>Let me start with a complaint: When we booked the hotel, the Marriott website stated that the rooms were furnished with full ovens. That was a major consideration because we wanted to have healthy home-cooked meals during the vacation. As it turned out, the kitchen only had a two-burn cook-top, which was typical of most of the newer Residence Inns. We made do just fine and the website description has been updated since the time of our reservation.

The property was nicely maintained with a wonderful outdoor pool. The location was surprisingly convenient...minutes to the airport and south outlet mall; easy access to the highways; just across the overpass from the south end of the strip. The staff could not have been friendlier. Every request or question we had was addressed promptly and courteously. A few times, inconsiderate guests did not pick up after their dogs; but, the hotel took care of it within minutes of being made aware of the situation.

I would recommend this property, especially for families.</p><br>Great place to stay off the strip<p>The hotel was quiet and staff was very friendly. The rooms were comfy and roomy. The breakfast was good for us. Not far from the strip. The rooms and the pool was clean. A comfortable stay and I would recommend this hotel to families or people wanting to escape the crowd of the strip.</p><br>Great Hotel off the Strip of Las Vegas<p>We spent three nights at this hotel in April. Our king suite was very clean and quiet. Very nice outdoor pool. The daily breakfast was good. We rented a car and it was only a 5 minute drive to The Strip. We highly recommend this hotel. Staff was always friendly and accommodating.</p><br>Nice Off Strip location<p>It is what you expect from a Residence Inn. Roomy studios, friendly staff, and close to what you need. Breakfast room was large and built to accommodate the large crowds here. Staff took care to note I am a repeat customer, offered the loyalty gifts and treated me very well. Internet connectivity was solid for the duration of the trip.</p><br>Lacking Security<p>Overall nice hotel and I do credit that the front desk staff is courteous. The grounds appear to be well kept and the room was clean as should be typical.

That said, I do feel that the security is lacking at the hotel. I stayed in the west building (to the right of the front office). The electronic doors are messed up. I was able to enter the door from the parking lost on several different occasions without a room key despite the "red" light being lit just because the latch didn't close. On the exterior door leading from the courtyard...just the opposite...locked out completely from the building despite entering my room key.

I think the worst, though, is that the hotel is in a deceptively dangerous area. At about 2:30am, thugs were going thru the parking lot looking for stuff to steal out of cars. They smashed the window out of one car and came back a few minutes later to smash another window in an attempt to remove a case. I know the hotel is not responsible, but I witnessed no response from hotel security despite all the noise and the alarm going off. There are also no visible cameras.
Room Tip: Second or third floor to avoid security issues.
