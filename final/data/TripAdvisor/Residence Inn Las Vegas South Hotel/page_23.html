<html><head><h3>Residence Inn Las Vegas South Hotel Reviews Page 23</h3></head><body><br>This place is great<p>My family ( three small children 3,7,9) stayed here the last week of April while I attended a conference . This place was excellent with very clean rooms , a great breakfast and wonderful pool area that my family enjoyed while I was away. The location is very close to the strip ( only a 3-5 minute drive) and was close to shopping , groceries etc.. and was very reasonably priced .
I would recommend this spot to anyone .</p><br>A Great Palce To Stay<p>Hade A Nice Stay Here, We Were All Working A Production At The Mandalay Bay Witch Is A Very Short Drive From The Arena Less Than 5 Min Just Across The I-15, No Problem Checking In And The Rooms Were Larger Than Expected Witch Was Nice And Vary Clean, Lots Of Parking And Seem To Be Very Quite, Breakfast Is Complementary And So Is Internet In The Room, Beds Are O.K. And If You Get A Double Room Suite Each Room Has It Own Bathroom Witch Made The Crew Guys A Lot Happier, Itâ€™s the Little Things.</p><br>Mixed Review; Not great but not bad either<p>Well maintained new property with nice outdoor areas (swimming pool, sports court, etc.). We also liked the front desk staff who were very accomodating.

We had a two bedroom, two bath suite. These rooms are not as big as some of the older Residence Inns. They are functional but not spacious.

The complimentary high speed Internet was uneven and slow at times with pages hanging. We mentioned this to the front desk and were referred to the Service Provider. The issue was never resolved.

We like to cook and were disappointed to find that the largest burner on the stove was not operational. The timing was bad because we were in the middle of cooking. We called the front desk and a new burner was installed that day.

Beware of the refrigerator. The door has a low clearance and injured my partner's foot when he went to open the door.

Our dishwasher was either broken or was run twice each day(once by us and once by housekeeping). We started it each morning and found it still running when we returned 8 hours later.

Newspapers are limited and only available at the front desk (no door delivery). By 8:30am they were gone. There were no papers for sale so we had to go elsewhere to purchase.

We were on the top floor. There was an incredibly bright gas light outside our bedroom window at night. It bathed the room with artificial light. These high powered gas lights were outside many top floor units.

We also found that the walls between units were thin and not sound proofed. From our bedroom we could hear into the next unit.

In spite of the problems, the rooms were nicely decorated and the location was convenient for us. We liked the fact that there was no casino on property yet very close to the Strip. A nice break from the action.

We received a 30 percent discount with AAA. It was still expensive at $215 per night. On the other hand, we liked the fact that our family could all be together in the suite.</p><br>WONDERFUL!!!!! CLEAN!!!n FRIENDLY!!! GOOD FOOD!!!!<p>I was with 10 other women for a short vacation and we all loved the Inn. Our first impression was great....beautiful building, great lobby and the front desk employees were friendly and very helpful.
The rooms are large and very clean....we all felt very comfortable and offered privacy when needed.

The continental breakfast was awesome....a whole variety of warm and cold selections. Great for families.

The staff were all very friendly and helpful.
Can't wait to stay there again.</p><br>Wonderful accomadations<p>Our group of eleven women stayed at the Residence Inn and
we couldn't have enjoyed ourselves more.
What wonderful accomodations. The staff was all just wonderful
and very helpful. Very friendly and willing to go the extra mile
to make our stay an enjoyable expierence which it was.
Couldn't give this a high enough recommendation than
eleven woman all agreeing that this was a wonderful place
to stay.

North Dakota</p><br>Loved The Residence Inn!<p>Eleven friends (most of whom turned FIFTY this year) stayed last weekend at the Residence Inn, [--], in Las Vegas. We were VERY PLEASED with the beautiful accomodations, the spacious suites, the wonderful continental breakfasts, and the super friendly staff. Although this property is not located right on the "strip," it is close and there was complimentary shuttle service to "Mandalay Bay" every half hour. We had a GREAT time there and will definitely stay there again!!!
A special THANKS to Stephanie and Jeni !!!!</p><br>excellent base for las vegas<p>using marriott point, stayed only one night, next day go to grand canyon south rim entrance 5 hours away.
While in Las vegas, the hotol is fine for family.
My wife and i and 10 years old son all enjoy using the swimming pool and easy access to the strip.</p><br>Great Residence Inn<p>Staying at the property as I write this review, half way thorugh my stay of 10 night, traveling with a group of five, all staying in separate rooms. When traveling we used to stay at the big casino's but have tired of their size and lack of "personality". Found non-casino hotels to be much more accomodating. Still visit the casino's but nice to relax and unwind without all of the bells & whistles.

Check-in was hassle free. As a Marriott elite, they had cold bottled water and Milano cookies as a welcome gift. The water was great as I could already feel the desert dehydrating me. Room was a 1-bedroom suite with Queen bed and kitchen (sink, full size refrigerator, microwave). Room and bathroom were clean (I check before unpacking, just in case I need to swap rooms). Managers reception (Mon-Thurs) was good, hot dogs & salad first night, no beer/wine like other Residence Inn's, not a big problem but would have been nice to relax with a cold brew. Menu rotates througout the week and was adequate for an evening meal (saves $$), BBQ was great the second night. Breakfast each morning, scrambled eggs, cereal, sausage, hash browns, waffles, danish, juices, and fruits were in good supply and tasted good. Pool was nice and refreshing, a nice oasis. Both adults & kids enjoyed the pool most days. Noise from the pool was not distracting. After the first night, I asked for foam pillows instead of the down pillows and they were exchanged before I returned from work the next day. The hotel provides a shuttle bus to the strip, but did not use as I had a rental car. Hotel is conveniently located off of Russel, easy strip access. Co-worksers traveling with me had similar feelings for the hotel, top notch.

Pros: Friendly & efficient staff, non-casino hotel (less people, noise, & traffic). Property and rooms were clean and well maintained. Close to room parking (try that with a casino).

Cons: Near the flight path for McCarran airport, I heard the planes, but not enough to impede sleep or rest. Next door neighbors smoked and could smell the smoke occasionally, but all domestic Marriott hotels going entirely non-smoking in September, so this won't be a problem during future stays. [-----------] No beer/wine at the Manager's Reception.

I'd definately stay here again when staying in Las Vegas and looking for a non-casino hotel. Another alternative is the Residence Inn - Hughes Center. Been 1-2 years since I stayed there but was a nice place then. I couldn't book there this time due to availability of rooms.</p><br>Nice little resort<p>We were greeted by such a pleasant lady! We were able to get a non - smoking room and it was great! We had the two bedroom suite and my parents had the studio room.

It was the 4th of July weekend and they were short staffed but this was not a problem.

It was close to the strip and they had a shuttle but it needs to run longer.

This is great for families and people who don't need to be on the strip.

You will rest well in this nice hotel.</p><br>Suited us perfectly<p>We are a family of 5 from South Australia travelling in late April 2006. We chose to stay off the strip mainly because my mother-in-law is not fond of crowds and has never travelled before. I looked at reviews and was put off by a lot because of the wait in checking in or out as well as not getting the room you asked for or perhaps a smoking room. Anyway we had our own vehicle and this place is about a mile from the south end of the strip. We had 3 nights here. The bonus with this place was the 2 bedroom suite with kitchen, 3 TVs, laundry on our floor, free hot breakfast, free internet in the breakfast room, pool and spa, manager's welcome on weekday evenings which meant we could have hot dogs, nachos or salad with a drink and that saved us a lot on meals! I would definitely recommend this place to families. I would also stay here again.</p><br></body></html>
