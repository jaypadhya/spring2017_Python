<html><head><h3>Residence Inn Las Vegas South Hotel Reviews Page 20</h3></head><body><br>Great location to strip, reasonable rates.<p>My wife and I stayed here for the Rock & Roll Marathon and it was just a short walk to the Mandalay. The hotel offers a shuttle service every hour to the MGM and every half hour to Mandalay Bay. The shuttle will take you to the airport but will not pick you up at the airport. The cab fare was $15.

The room had a spacious living area and a very comfortable bed with plenty of pillows. The kitchen was handy and had all the amenities one could want while away from home. The room was spotless including the kitchen and bathroom.

The staff was very friendly and helpful, the lobby nicely decorated and the continental breakfast a big hit. This place is a great alternative to the strip hotels.

My only complaint about the stay isn't directly related to the hotel but to the menu that was in our room. The Residence Inn does not offer room service but we found 2 menu's from 2 different restaurants, one of which is highly recommended by the staff. DO NOT order from the Mama Mia's menu. It was horrible and I will be writing about it in a follow on review. The staff apologized the next day when I complained and said the Mama Mia's restaurant staff sneaks into the hotel and places their menu under the doors.</p><br>Great stay - Great Staff<p>Let me start by saying, two things. One, I have worked in hotels for 18 years and know a thing or two about them. Two, if you're traveling with a dog, this is one of the best I've been in...for the price! Yes, they ask for a cleaning deposit and if you are only staying one night, it it a bit high but if you choose this hotel for a getaway or long term stay, you won't be dissapointed. First off, it's a fairly new hotel and it is non-smoking! The rooms are super clean and spacious. They have a fully equipped kitchen and they also have a really nice comp breakfast. Traveling with a 14 year old dog, we had a lot of requests and the staff (Desse, David and Brooke) couldn't have been more accomadating. My belief is that it starts at the top and their manager Terra was terrific. We stayed for 17 days and could'nt be happier. They also offer a free shuttle to the MGM and Mandalay Bay...a nice touch. Pool and spa are really nice...gym a bit small but doable. Now, depending on why you are in Vegas and with who, will determine where you stay. We could have stayed at any of the really nice hotels on the strip for less money but few of them take pets and the ones that do are a fortune. If you don't like the strip but want to be close...if you're traveling with pets....if you like the extra room....THIS IS THE PLACE!</p><br>very comfortable<p>We have stayed here several times and everything is clean and we enjoy the breakfast buffet. It's quiet, and close enough to get to the strip in 5 minutes.</p><br>outdated room<p>outdated room, major reduction in free food for the evening</p><br>Excellent choice for off the strip stay<p>We had a 2 bedroom 2 bath suite that was very large, comfortable, clean and had a kitchen. Hotel offers a good breakfast, evening snacks on weekdays, and a shuttle to the strip from 7am to midnight. Staff is excellent and very helpful. A great place to stay that is quiet and also convenient to the strip. Is also non smoking. Safe area and we found it easy to get places by using Dean Martin Drive which parallels I 15 and has little traffic. Hotel has received exceptional cleanliness awards from Marriott and the reviewer who claimed to have had bed bugs did so out of spite and it was never true.</p><br>Cool And Nice<p>Stayed here 4 nights in the 2 bedroom suite,nice hotel,clean and respectful.Food was good,located near the airport,but didn't really hear the airplanes.If you rent a car its a 5 minute drive to the strip,or if you dont,you can ride the shuttle bus,and it will drop you off and pick you up at the MGM Hotel.Will stay again next time i come to Las Vegas.</p><br>Too Long IN Sin City<p>Trip was a blast!!!! What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas, hopefully. Be sure you take you Visa card, because your American Express has no limit. You will need some form of control, if only in your mind.</p><br>Convenient location, nice pool, pet deposit too expensive<p>Stayed with family & small kids. The hotel is pet friendly, but the pet deposit was $100 which was very expensive. It is very pet friendly, lots of places to walk the pooch and handy refuse bags near all open areas. Decor was very nice and clean. Staff was efficient (we checked-in behind 4 other parties and they had extra hands at the registration desk when needed...I was impressed). Besides the inflated pet deposit, the only other downfall is that the place is right next to the I-15 and the in-bound flight path for the airport, so don't expect a lot of quiet time. It is a great alternative to the normal casino-scene stuff, great for kids. Pool area is better than most, has a nice waterfall, changing rooms and restrooms inside the pool area. We will stay again, but not with our pooch in tow.</p><br>Positives and Negatives - Judge For Yourself<p>We stayed here from July 25-27.

Positive aspects of this hotel:

1. Far enough away from the Strip, that there are not swarms of tourists around.
2. Good, decent breakfast every morning (eggs, potatoes, toast, meat, pastries, cereals and more)
3. Excellent staff. Very attentive and helpful.
4. Clean rooms, as most Residence Inns have.
5. Free parking and Internet.

Negative aspects of this hotel:

1. It is right next to the freeway, and if you end up getting a room facing that side (which we did), it is quite noisy all through the night.
2. Lots of families with small children stay here (children screamed loudly for hours in the room next to ours). Note: this is not the fault of the hotel.
3. You need a car to get anywhere near the Strip (unless you take the free shuttle, which only runs at certain times of the day).
4. Swimming pool is quite small.</p><br>Good hotel outside the Strip<p>We stayed in this hotel for 3 nights. We had a two bedroom suite and it's nice when you have three children. Breakfast was good but not great. It's not close to any store or restaurants , it's about a mile to Mandalay Bay . Free high speed internet.</p><br></body></html>
