<html><head><h3>Residence Inn Las Vegas South Hotel Reviews Page 17</h3></head><body><br>Couldn't have been better<p>Room was beautiful, very spacious, had everything we needed and more. Impeccably clean. Front desk staff and breakfast staff very courteous, helpful, friendly. Beautiful pool area, although it was too cold to swim when we were there. Easy parking. Decent breakfast included (not found at Strip hotels!). You could walk to the Mandalay Bay from here if it weren't for the interstate. But the shuttle system worked perfectly for us. On time, easy to board, clean shuttle bus, professional driver. This is a great little oasis for visiting The Strip. We did hear the jets the first night, but not the second, so I guess it depends on the flight paths and the weather. Close to the rental car drop off and the airport too.</p><br>Nice to stay on points, but will never be back.<p>Shuttle doesn't run like they report. I've waited at Mandalay bay for over 40 minutes, but they reportedly run every 30. All their printed material in rooms not up to date. For example, "just drop your grocery list at the front desk by 9 am (8 am on some paperwork) and your groceries will be delivered to your room that same day. This is on the fridge and in the little booklet in the room, but guess what, they don't grocery shop on the weekends. Now, when I dropped off my list at 7:30 am on Sunday and the front desk person said, ok, no problem, you'd think he would have told me, oh, we don't shop on Sunday. Nope, gone all day till 6 pm, expecting to come back and cook my dinner, but no groceries. Had to check my messages to hear, we don't shop on weekends.

Let's see, toaster not working right, not heating, turn around to get my knife and now all the sudden smoke coming out. Lucky the smoke alarm didn't go off. This was early so I didn't say anything. Get back to my room after 6 pm, and it still smells like smoke/burnt food. So housekeeping didn't notice the smell and just made the bed and left? How about airing out the room and spraying a little febreeze??? Then trying to open the windows to air out the room, window smashed my finger cause its not in the tracks right, and wasn't even locked. Guess I should have checked that on day one for my own safety.....that's my fault Marriott.

Didn't take out trash. Furnace is right beside the bed in a little closet you don't have access to, making the worst racket. Told them they might want to check it. Don't know if they did and just can't fix it, or didn't look at it, cause it still makes the same racket. No remote, they did replace that. Good job there!!!

Overall, this property not at all like other Marriott properties. I can honestly say I will never stay here again, free stay or not. I come to Vegas often for conferences, but sorry Marriott, guess I'll stay at recommended conference hotels in future.

They do offer breakfast, some manager small meals thru week, and free Internet. But thats about the only good thing I can say.</p><br>Great hotel, great value.<p>Overall very pleased. Beautiful, clean room, except that they somehow missed two chips from previous people on the floor. My parents also had a room which was beautiful and clean and theirs even had a gas fireplace. Mom was impressed, which says a lot since she is not easy to please. Breakfast was great and is free. Used the shuttle and had no problems. Can't wait to stay again.</p><br>Clean but average<p>We stayed in a one bedroom suite for two nights at this R.I. over the M.L.K. weekend. It did not feel crowded and the staff was very friendly. I was not pleased with the noise level, I could hear the airplanes pass over, street noise and neighbors in the next room. I suppose since I have stayed in other Vegas hotels where sound proofing was better I expected more.
The room was clean and the kitchen was stocked with everything we needed. Location is off the strip and it was easily to get around Vegas from the hotel. The breakfast was plentiful, with scrambled eggs, do-it-yourself waffles, muffins, cereal, coffee and fruit to name a few things. The pool was heated and others we know enjoyed the BBQ.
My kids slept in the sofa bed, it did not look as if it had been used in a while but is was adequate. The blankets were very rough and we did not have enough towels for the family, so we had to ask for more towels. The queen sized bed was also just OK. I would suggest this to those on a budget who want to have their own kitchen.
Room Tip: Building B might be quieter than Building A as it will be away from the freeway, the fourth floor is...

Complimentary breakfast was lavish and fresh. Complimentary shuttle ran every 30 minutes to Mandalay Bay; it was faster getting to the Mandalay Convention Center from this property than the Luxor next door!

Rooms were great, quiet, spacious, great firm beds, everything was clean and first class.

NOTE that some reviewers downgraded this hotel because it is 'far from the action'; it is, but that's KIND OF the point! If you want action there are dozens of choices on the strip. This hotel is fantastic for business travel or families that DON'T want to be in a casino porperty!
Room Tip: Suites all have kitchenettes and living areas, as with most Residence Inn, fantastic for extended st...
See more room tips</p><br>Love this place<p>This was a great hotel and location. Not directly on the strip but they have shuttle that runs every hours and drop you off in two different locations on the strip. The shuttle run to and from every hour, you can also have the shuttle take you to select store.
I had a 2 room suite, very clean; the staff was SUPER pleasant and always available for assistance. They donâ€™t have a shuttle to pick you up from the airport, but they will take you to the airport after your stay. To take a shuttle from the airport to the hotel was less than $8.00.
The hotel service breakfast every morning, and select meal on chosen nights. There is a pool and hot tub. I would totally recommend this hotel.</p><br>Value in Las Vegas<p>Business travelers: consider the Residence Inn Las Vegas South. Convieniently located along I-15, the RI is a welcome and economical change from the crowded, noisy casino hotels. Rooms are extremely clean, and well furnished. Compare the cost of a casino hotel breakfast with the Residence Inn's complimentary breakfast - your travel budget will have room left for gambling or sightseeing. When you don't feel like driving your car, the Residence Inn has a shuttle bus to the MGM and Mandalay Bay casinos. Unlike at the casino hotels, we earn Marriott Rewards points at the Residence Inn. Our sales team stays here when we have business events in Las Vegas.</p><br>Fab place to stay<p>We love the delicious free breakfast and free shuttles to Mandalay bay and MGM! The shuttle guys r so helpful! The rooms are clean and have nice little kitchens.</p><br>Nice off the strip hotel<p>We only stayed one night but the location was good and the shuttle was a bonus. Our room was a typical Residence Inn room. Nothing fancy but clean and the free breakfast was nice and plenty too. The room was comfortable and the bedding with all the extra pillows were a plus. I would stay here again.</p><br>It was okay<p>I stayed at Ri Las Vegas South back in June while on vacation and I stayed in a one bedroom suite that faced away from the 15 freeway. We checked in late on Sunday and stayed for three nights. I had always stayed on the "strip" and looked forward to having other things to do than gamble my money away. When we arrived, our first room had a leak from the refridgerator, so we called the FD and the person apologized and we had a new room. Our second room had some kind of dark stain on the couch and a black stain on the carpet near the bathroom sink. There was also a food stain in the microwave (that took 2 phone calls to finally get corrected). When we were all checked-in, we wanted to sit in the pool after our long trip to the property, but were advised by the Night Auditor (on Sunday) that the pool closes at midnight. We eventually went into the pool on Tuesday night after midnight, but no one said anything. They offerred a shuttle to the strip, but since most of the resorts have free parking, we just drove where ever we wanted to go. The breakfast in this hotel was pretty good, except for the size of the eating area (you'll find that with most of the new RI's).

We did not induldge in the evening social hour (which was a salad) or have breakfast before we left. Combined with the lack of service and other RI's in the area, I doubt we will be returning to this property. It was a nice location, near the freeway, and the rooms were very quiet.
Room Tip: Get a room that is away from the freeway on the western side of the property
