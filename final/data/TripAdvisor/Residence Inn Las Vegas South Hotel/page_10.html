<html><head><h3>Residence Inn Las Vegas South Hotel Reviews Page 10</h3></head><body><br>Large, comfy, full-featured<p>My wife and I were looking for a place close to McCarran for overnight stays on our way into and out of Las Vegas. We chose the Residence Inn, and we were very glad we did.

The staff were exceptionally accommodating. When we checked in the first night, we were upgraded to a two-bedroom suite at no charge. On our way back, we arrived ridiculously early. I was sure we'd be told we couldn't check in yet, but the desk clerk gave us a room immediately.

The rooms are large, comfortable and quiet, with a full kitchen. We enjoyed the outdoor pool--daytime temps were in the 100s F! The free breakfast was pretty typical for an American motel; it did not disappoint. We made use of the free shuttle to Mandalay Bay for a night out one evening.

All in all, my wife and I were very happy with our stays.</p><br>Comfortable stay<p>Great for those traveling on business or for those that want a quiet hotel away from the strip. I was traveling for work so this hotel was convenient. The parking is right outside your door. Not like the casino hotels where you have to park far away in the self park or wait for the valet. When you're on business you don't want to waste time waiting in some valet line. Same thing with checking in and then walking to your room. Last thing I want to do is walk through a crowded casino to get to the elevator and then walk forever to get to the room. Staying at the Residence Inn is so much easier than being on the strip. And the good thing is that the strip is extremely close. So you truly can experience the best of both if you really want to.

Clean and courteous staff. Breakfast and evening snacks were excellent.</p><br>Great value for the money, and just a short drive to the strip.<p>Traveling with our young-adult son and daughter, we were looking for space, without always renting two hotel rooms each night for two weeks. This was a great find, a good value. We had a two-bedroom, 2 bath suite, with small living room and kitchen. The rooms are not really large, but they are comfortable, and the best point for us is the privacy of separate rooms. This hotel had one of the best breakfast buffets I've ever been to at a hotel. In a week, you could eat something different (and hot!) every day! Plenty of good, and good hours on the buffet. Very helpful front-desk staff. The hotel is not on the strip, and it's not a big fancy venue like the name brand hotels on the strip. On the other hand, after a day and evening on the strip, it was nice to retreat to a quieter street. The hotel has a convenient shuttle service back and forth to the strip that our kids took advantage of. For the price and space and breakfast, I'd recommend it. If you want to be on the strip, look elsewhere. I, for one, was glad to stay off the strip.</p><br>Great for families<p>We stayed here twice in the span of two weeks. We did not do very much in Las Vegas as it's not really our thing and we were only there to go to the National Parks in Utah.

First, they upgraded me twice to a 2 bedroom suite. I was there with my family so it was appreciated. A lot of Residence Inns won't do it even for platinum (which I am). The staff was friendly and helpful.

The breakfast was good.

The hotel has shuttles to a couple of spots so you don't have to worry about driving or parking.

The pool was great for kids.

The only con is that it's in an industrial neighborhood near the highway. Occasionally there is airport noise. The noise from outside did bother me a bit at night.</p><br>Our 30th Wedding Anniversary stay.<p>We rode in to Las Vegas from Colorado on our Harley and we were exhausted. I asked for the quietest room for rest. We were put in room #400 and it had a wonderful view of the strip. The Hotel offers free shuttle service to NYNY or Mandalay Bay Convention Center. We had difficulty with pick up timing on returning to hotel. Sometimes the shuttle arrived early or late and left within a minute of arriving. The overall stay was great. The staff very helpful, the breakfast was good. There was plenty of dining space. We enjoyed a visit to Costco Wholesale to buy a pizza, water, and snacks while on the strip. If you want to enjoy Las Vegas without the noise and light of the strip, then this is a good choice!
Room Tip: Fourth floor for peace!

We had a two bedroom suite which included two full bedrooms with their bathrooms, living area and fully equipped kitchen. Our room was toward the front so we were overlooking Mandalay Bay. This hotel is about a mile off the strip and has a shuttle which takes you to the strip where you can connect to other areas by tram and monorail. It also has a hot breakfast served everyday with variety. The staff was helpful and very friendly. I would definitely stay there again.</p><br>Would Have Rated "Very Good" if not for the Door Issue<p>We stayed here for 2 nights at the beginning of our 12 day road trip. I prefer hotels off the strip because they don't charge that annoying "Resort Fee." There were 4 of us in a 2 bedroom suite which worked out well. Each bedroom has its own bathroom. We encountered a problem within a half hour of our arrival. We had unpacked and were headed out to the strip when we discovered the door to our suite would not lock. We did not notice a problem with it when we first entered the suite. We opened and closed the door, we examined the locking mechanisms and we realized the door was not aligned properly which prevented it from locking. We called the front desk and the woman who answered said to "give her five minutes" to get someone. We wrongly assumed someone would be at our room in five minutes. About a half hour later, we called the front desk again. This time she said she would check on the person she had called, who apparently was not even on the property. The longer we waited, the more annoyed we became and the 2 older persons in our group decided they didn't want to go out anymore. Finally, a guy shows up, examines the door, takes a part off of it and announces that while the door would now lock, he would need to return in the morning with another part to complete the fix. The next morning, a different guy shows up, looks at it and announces that he doesn't have a piece that he needs and would have to return. Eventually, the door did get fixed and worked properly, but what an annoying start to our road trip!
Aside from the door, everything else about our stay was good. We loved the beds, especially the pillows. The shower was wonderful with good water pressure. 3 members of our group had the complimentary breakfast and enjoyed it. Parking was an issue as when we returned late both nights, there was no parking available. We ended up parking in the adjacent parking lot, which belonged to another Marriott hotel.
Despite the door issue, which I doubt would ever happen again, I would consider staying at this property on our next visit to Vegas.</p><br>Well maintained and friendly service<p>Stayed here with family in a 2 bedroom for two nights. Far better than the Hughes center one. Very well maintained and kept. Clean.... My wife who worked as a house keeper in hotels was impressed.

Comfy beds for a residence inn. Good breakfast. Great airport shuttle that dropped off family so they did not have to worry about returning rental day of.

Would gladly stay here again if I needed it on my next Vegas trip.

Good location.... If you have a car. Close to tons of shopping and silverton casino and bass pro.

Nice pool as well.</p><br>Residence Inn South, Las Vegas, Nevada - Well worth it!<p>Behind Mandalay Bay, so it's close to the Strip when you want action but far enough away to avoid the conjestion. Easy access on/off the fwy when you want to go downtown, to the other strip casinos, or coming home and want to stop at In N Out for a late snack. Hotel is VERY clean, staff is VERY polite and accommodating. I would leave a note for the housekeeper for extra items and when we return there they were. Breakfast is included and is very good. My fave, Belgium waffles. Coffee is available 24 hrs. When you're ready to retire for the evening it is very peaceful. The FULL kitchen is wonderful. For the price it is well worth it, especially since breakfast is included. They even have free WIFI in the room, not just in the lobby. We've been staying here for years and wouldn't change.
Room Tip: Our favorite rooms are 100 or 122, ground floor, corner rooms with lots of light. Close to the lobby...

But to my surprise, this hotel was a great change from the hectic, smoky, loud, hotels of the strip. I went on a work trip and will definitely be staying there when I go for work. I appreciate the complimentary water and chips and the fact that there isn't any gambling on the premises.

Pros: No gambling, smoke free, not a gigantic hotel, great staff, easy to get to from the airport, clean. They run free shuttles to the airport and to the Mandalay Bay

Cons: If you go down to the lobby area around 9 am, it becomes a feeding frenzy of people that had just woken up from a long night! The pool is hilarious... small rock feature.. ooohh ahhh!

Overall: Great place to stay for business travel.</p><br></body></html>
