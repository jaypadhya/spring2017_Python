Check appliances once in awhile.</p><br>Great value and perfect for our needs<p>Our family of five stayed here for a quick overnight on our way from Denver to San Diego. The property is located in close proximity to the strip so the kids got to see the big-name hotels as we drove in. As for the hotel itself, it was very clean and well-maintained. We stayed in a large two-bedroom suite that was perfect for our family. The hot breakfast was tasty with a large variety of items and we all enjoyed the pool before getting back on the road. Not one thing to complain about!</p><br>What a great place, the best!<p>We were here Aug. 2 to Aug 9, everything was great. We arrived before check in time and they were more then happy to hold our bags while our room was ready. We took the shuttle service that they offer to the strip, which was great as the drivers are really friendly.The room was really nice and perfect for my family. The staff and managers are the best I have ever seen at any hotel I have stayed at. I will make sure that the next time I come to Las Vegas I stay here. Thank you for such a great stay!</p><br>Great Stay and We Will Be Back!<p>We stayed here on July 1 to the 5th and had a great time. The front desk was great with checking us in and answering all our questions. The room we got was perfect and the breakfast was good. The free shuttle to the strip really helped getting around. I will be coming back and would suggest this place to anyone with family or for work.</p><br>Nice hotel, but extremely noisey<p>When we arrived they wouldn't give us AARP or AAA discount because it was a holiday weekend, but they had plenty of rooms left, we could choose which floor we wanted. The room itself was very nice and clean, but incredibly noisey from airplanes and trains going by. They had a nice breakfast, but no where near enough space to eat for all of the rooms.</p><br>Disappointing Front Desk Staff, But Otherwise Fine<p>A one-night stay at a Residence Inn following a late flight into Las Vegas provided the usual comforts of a Residence Inn. Clean, comfortable, good breakfast. But the front desk personnel were far from welcoming. Never asked us a question besides “name?” and never offered any help, suggestions, or information about the hotel (rate on our reservation, hours of breakfast, etc.) And when we checked out, not even a perfunctory “was everything all right?” In fact, it wasn’t. Behind the closed curtains in the three room suite were open windows, which we did not discover until the next morning, after wondering through the early hours why there was no much plane noise outside. When we discovered that the windows were open we closed them and the noise level went down. What was housekeeping thinking?</p><br>Great Stay off the Strip<p>Residence Inn is great for families especially ones that have kids. Full kitchens can make a big difference in convenience. They feature a hot breakfast thats already included with the rate, a business center, and social hours that have free food. Whether its a short trip or long, Residence Inn is a good buy off the strip away from the smoking and noisy casinos.</p><br>No issues, just your average Residence Inn<p>I am writing this in my room so if anything changes I'll update the review.

Large room as expected. Very clean. All furnishing are in good shape. The check in people were very fast, in fact had my key made already so all I had to do was hand them my ID and CC. In building A the elevator is in the middle, its sort of a long walk to my room which is on the corner. In fact I have taken the stairs every time I come and go because the elevator is so far away. Pool area looks nice but too cold to try it out. Breakfast every morning, and it changes slightly every day. Not a very large area to eat in so get there early. Not much to look at in the area, lots of warehouses and a huge strip club. If you get in late parking near your room can be an issue. Also the hotel is right next to the flight path of one of McCarran's runways so it can be a little loud.

All in all it's a decent hotel. It certainly doesn't feel like Vegas which maybe a good thing :)</p><br>The Best non-gaming hotel in Las Vegas<p>The front desk clerk, Dhesse Evanhoose, was wonderful. We checked in very late, tired from a 13 hour drive. She greeted us, processed our registration in a short time, offered refreshments and even had a luggage cart brought to us from an adjacaent property. While the rooms are "starting to show their age," the common areas are beautiful, the breakfaqst one of the best "freebies" we've had in a long time, and the Staff just unequaled.
Room Tip: 4th floor facing the pool give a view of City.
