<html><head><h3>Residence Inn Las Vegas South Hotel Reviews Page 5</h3></head><body><br>Nice and Clean<p>Our room was nicely decorated and nice and clean, which is very important to me!
It is located next to the highway which is busy all hours. It is directly below the departing airplane traffic also! The buildings are not soundproofed very well.
The shampoo and hair conditioner accessories are extremely small. No lotion is provided. Ask for your sample at the front desk. I have arthritis in my hands and find it very difficult to open the containers. The shower worked fine; but the sink drain was slow.
Parking is ample; the elevator is quiet; breakfast is acceptable.
Too many negatives. I would not choose to stay here again.
Room Tip: Ask to stay in the rear building facing away from the highway. The highway is busy 24 hours.

The furnishings were adequate and for the most part in good shape. The breakfast every morning was good and helped start our days. The service of our room was good and Gerry at the front desk was a pure delight and very helpful.
Overall, good place to stay for longer period. As a last note, noise from airport was NOT and issue.</p><br>Nice Non Casimo Hotel<p>Newer Residence Inn. Rooms decent size. Great location to Mandalay Bay convention center and I 15. Breakfast has everything you need including waffles. Nice pool for a Residence Inn. Fitness center has 4 working machines. This is a good alternative to the casino hotels if here on business.</p><br>ok for a night near the airport<p>Although this hotel is very close to the airport, they do not provide an airport shuttle bus to pick up which is a shame, as it is closer to the airport and more attractive than the other Residence Inn in Green Valley/Henderson that does provide a shuttle bus. We booked the 2 bed/s bath suite which was nice and spacious. The staff were all friendly and helpful, particularly the breakfast staff. I liked the fact that at breakfast they provided 3 waffle makers in a separate room, to prevent the queues that often form for these.
Room Tip: Book a 2 bed/2 bath suite if you are travelling with family
See more room tips</p><br>Thanks for saving our night<p>We arrived at 1 am on a Friday night due to being denied our prepaid reservation at Fortune Inn. We were told they had rooms because they don't overbook. What a relief. I pictured us searching in the middle of a busy night.</p><br>Stay experienced issues<p>Lifetime Platinum member of Marriott, spent 5 weeks in Las Vegas June-July 2014 we stayed at the typical resorts Cosmo, Wynn, Venetian & Palazzo however this is a great alternative to do laundry when away from home. Booked 2 nites June 13-15 and the stay was great, staff friendly and no noise issues, and most importantly the laundry room was large and clean. Booked another stay 6/27 for 2 nites to catch up on laundry and the stay was a much different experience.
We had several poor experiences so we took the time to note on the comment card all the issues and at check out ask that the comment card be given to the General manager, we were assured it would be on their desk for Monday morning - it is now Aug and we never heard from anyone - as a lifetime platinum an apology was expected. I have never experienced a rep. not contacting me.
Issues were the pool in the middle of summer was closed, but at check in it was never mentioned. Put my clothes on to wash and headed to the pool to find it empty and out of service. AC in the room was not performing with all the window shades closed and the air on full blast it never got below 77, last evening the elevator broke while we were in it. Fortunately we were able to get out but had to climb to 4th floor one person with bad knees. Being a very frequent hotel guest we understand situations arise but to bring to the attention of management and it go unrecognized was pure customer service and we will not considering staying at this hotel again. In July I need a hotel with laundry so I found a Marriott I could stay for 2 nites to do laundry instead of this hotel.
Room Tip: 2nd bldg. off interstate is quitter.
See more room tips</p><br>Very fiendly staff, good location<p>I spent several weeks here during the month with very few problems. The front desk and kitchen staff were always very friendly. There are often a lot of kids around so if you are here on business as for a higher floor. I had a neighbor above me who dribbled a basketball almost nonstop and the front desk offered to move my room. I had a problem with my refrigerator not cooling sufficiently and the staff replaced it with in 10 minutes. During my long stay I did have a couple small issues that I emailed the manager about and never got a response. I chose to deal directly with her rather than corporate and thought it was odd that she didn't respond, more so considering I am platinum elite in the Marriott rewards system. One of the issues was 4 out of 6 dryers didn't work in my building which meant a line to dry your clothes. Lucky for her she has a great staff behind her that make the hotel feel like home. Overall, great location close to the strip but far enough away to avoid it if desired, relaxing pool, amazing staff, and better than average food for breakfast and evening socials (tues, wed, thur). I would, and likely will, stay here again. Thanks for making me feel at home!! Happy travels
Room Tip: I would try to get a room facing the pool or on the north side. Noise from the highway, strip club a...
See more room tips</p><br>It's the best place to stay when you have teenagers<p>We are here for basketball tournament, July 23-27. We had a 2 bedroom suite and our room was on the first floor by the pool. They have decent breakfast, don't expect too much though. Jerry (front staff) and Derick (the shuttle driver) are the best staff here. Derick gave us the best way to navigate the strip from Mandalay Bay to Bellagio using trams. That's how you treat guests with great service and attitude.</p><br>Not at the top of its game<p>This was our third or fourth time at this hotel and the kids always looked forward to coming back here. Unfortunately, there were a few problems and we just didn't feel that the staff were as fabulous as we had previously remembered them to be. When we checked in, the woman on the front desk was slightly rude but nothing I would normally worry about. Hours later, one of the two toilets in our suite stopped up and we couldn't get anyone to fix it. A man brought a plunger but no one followed through the next day when we asked for it to be fixed. So we had a master bedroom with kids walking in all night to use our toilet (before the other was fixed the following day).
We booked for five people in the suite but had between three and four sets of plates, bowls and silverware. We got a little bit more by asking but never a full set. There was no trash can in the kitchen and the person on the front desk told me that was probably normal. I think in a suite, with a full kitchen, that most waste is going to come from preparing food. The dishwasher had a couple of broken parts but still worked. We also had to ask for bedding for the fold-out couch. I think, since we pre-booked, our room should have been ready for five people.
On the upside, it's still a great way to stay in Vegas with a family, the pool is still fun for the kids and clean. Full breakfast is included and there is a regular shuttle to the south end of the Strip.</p><br>Great location, friendly staff, clean and quiet. <p>We had a great weekend in Vegas thanks to the nice staff at Residence inn. This place is very close to both the airport and the strip. After fun times on the strip, it was nice to return to the Residence Inn to relax around the pool and escape from the craziness on the strip.

We got some good shopping tips from Crystal and Jerry at the front desk. All of the staff members here were friendly and helpful, we met the general manager, Jenny, and thanked her for making this such a nice place to visit. We will definitely be back soon, and look forward to staying here again!!</p><br></body></html>
