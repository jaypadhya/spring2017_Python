<html><head><h3>Residence Inn Las Vegas South Hotel Reviews Page 8</h3></head><body><br>Near the Strip, but Quiet<p>I love RI properties. This one is on the west side of I-15 across from the southern end of the strip (Luxor) and LAS airport. As usual for RI property a nice size room, pool, hot tub, with a good breakfast. The room interior was fresh and fairly new. The breakfast area has multiple eating areas which was nice versus one large area given the number of soccer players that was in the LV area for a tournament I assume. It was a nice stay was plenty of parking and only an occasional noise of the airport across the highway from hotel area. There is a small challenge in getting to the property because it is on a frontage road with I-15 (Dean Martin blvd) so study a map before driving here. The only improvements I would suggest is a larger workout room and higher speed wifi. Good connection on the 4th floor, but only 256kbps at night with 2.5mbps during the day. I would stay here again.</p><br>Just what I needed<p>Just returned from a four night stay while visiting LV with my niece and nephew. Our 2 room suite met all of our needs. It was clean, quiet and comfortable. Although the noise from jets overhead is common, we quickly blocked it out and it wasn't a problem. We had a rental car and parking was adequate and convenient. Grounds were nicely landscaped and well kept. Pool looked inviting for warmer weather. Hotel is convenient to the strip and we found it easy to navigate once we became familiar with the layout. I thought it a little odd that are there is a separate building where our suite was located requiring us to go outside of the main building where check in, etc are located. Breakfast was basic hot and cold choices - nothing fancy but clean and adequate. Dining area includes 3 separate rooms - plenty of room for everyone. There really aren't any restaurants or stores close by. You either have to drive yourself or take the shuttle to other areas. I would stay here again - definitely like the off strip, no smoking, no gaming Marriott.</p><br>Standard - no surprises<p>Stayed here on business, and delightfully found no surprises. Staff is helpful and unobtrusive, breakfast was as expected, beautiful pool and hot tub area. The only confusion was it was difficult to find the check in office. The only concern I had, I like to take walks, and this is located in an industrial area, that was kind of uncertain. I stayed on the property instead.
Room Tip: Choose a room that opens on the courtyard over the pool/hot tub.

Hotel was close to everything that there is to do so you don't have to drive on the busy Las Vegas streets. Would stay here again</p><br>Friendly staff - tired, noisy room<p>Everyone was nice here, but it was just not a great experience. The room we had booked was not available at the 3PM check in, so we had to take a room with a smaller bed. Then we could not close the wide-open window we found upon arriving until we called maintenance, who also had to replace a non-functioning lamp. The street outside our window was VERY noisy. We had to go outside to a separate building for breakfast, and when we returned to our building, our key card no longer worked, so once again back to the desk. Things just need to work better here overall!
Room Tip: Try to get one facing away from streets.

The hotel consists of 2 buildings, with the lobby in building A. I had a room in building B and opened the door to find a menu for a local fast food joint that was slipped under the door. That wasn't awful, but when I watched a different menu get slipped under the door a few hours later, I was not amused. The building door is accessible by keycard only, yet menus appear under doors?

The room itself was standard RI, circa 1990's. Everything was in place, clean, and usable, but looked worn and dated. The bed was comfortable, the bathroom was small but functional, with the vanity outside the bathroom.

I took the shuttle (which is shared by 3 nearby properties) to Mandalay Bay and then took the tram to the strip. I ended up taking a cab back from the strip, which cost 10-13 dollars. I wish the shuttle went to a better location on the strip, and ran for longer as taxis had trouble finding the RI.

Overall, for the price I paid and compared to hotels on the Strip, I was disappointed, but if the location works for you and you need the kitchen, this property is for you.
Room Tip: Choose a high floor to minimize noise

Main purpose of our trip was hiking, so we rented a car and drove to Utah, Arizona, California and also to Red Rock Canyon in Nevada. So the location worked perfectly for us. The two times we went out to the strip in the evening, we would take the shuttle provided by the hotel which took us to New York New York one time and to Mandalay Bay the other time. Each time we had a very helpful, courteous driver.

When we checked into the hotel, we were given the choice of a room either facing the courtyard or outside (roads) and the receptionist recommended facing the courtyard, so that's what we chose, but it turned out that our room was facing the outdoor basketball court and we could hear the ball bouncing anytime there was someone playing there, which was quite often. So facing the roads might be better, but I'm not sure.

Cleanliness of the room was excellent.

As for a nearby restaurant from the hotel, we particularly liked Yard House in Town Square, which is only a 5-minute drive from the hotel. They had great craft beer choices on tap as well as excellent wine selections, in addition to great food. We highly recommend it.
Pinball Hall of Fame, which is only 10 minutes away from the hotel, is a unique and surprisingly fun place to visit, too.

Overall, if you're looking for a great, clean place to stay outside the strip, we highly recommend this hotel.</p><br>Very Dissappointed<p>I booked online, indicated we had a pet, and recieved an email confirmation of the rate and that the request for the pet room was noted. At check in the desk agent assessed an additional $100 cleaning fee, I was floored, never would have booked the room. He said it was on my confirmation (it was not) and on their website ( I went back again and could not find it) and that it is normal for the area. I have stayed at least ~30 nights in Residence Inns with our pet and have never paid more than $25. I also checked the local hotels around this property, one very high profile casino does charge $100, but most others charge $20 or nothing at all. While they claim to be pet friendly I would classify the property as pet tolerant with a puniative cleaning fee. Not indicating this fee until check in felt like a bait and switch to me. We stayed on a Friday night, they offered to waive the cancellation fee but I could not find another hotel with vacancy given the weekend. They did offer to drop it to $75 but it was still way to much.

The breakfast was good, the room was clean. We did have a closet door that was broken and needed to call for sheets for the sofa bed. The location of our room at the end of the hotel seemed to be right across from the railroad tracks and at the end of the airport runway. Lots of noise, was woken but a plane at 1:30am. Staff was professional in dealing with my concern, actually getting me the number to Marriott customer care to log my concerns about the lack of notification on a $100 cleaning fee.
Room Tip: Ask not to be on the train track / airport side of hotel.

Always on time. The staff is outstanding. After staying there for a week i got to know several staff members very well. i can't name everyone in this post but special mention to Holly & Omar....Everyone was very helpful with whatever was needed. I have stayed in several Las Vegas hotels in the past but for all that the Residencel Inn has to offer it can't be beat...I look forward to staying there 2-3 times in 2014!!!!</p><br>Well maybe not for everyone.........................<p>I have to say I am a gold rewards member for years. I have been to these hotels all over the US. Usually there are no issues. This one stands out with some concerns. First, I had to make this reservation through PrICELINE because I needed a flight, car, and hotel (cheaper). I called a couple days prior for a handicapped room because of my needs. When we arrived we got the room literally right off the freeway....okay we Immediately turned on the A/C(its quite warm here). To our surprise it sounded like a jackhammer. Front desk staffer told us our room could not be changed. We stuffed extra blankets and pillows into the "utility" closet to shut that noise off. Apparently this has been a "issue" for this room. Smoking is a big problem with this hotel. Never had this issue anywhere else with this chain. People smoke everywhere. There are no smoking laws in NV cigarette butts and glass everywhere. I paid more to stay at a smoke free facility so don't waste your time. Nice property ruined. We came her for a medical convention. I have no interest in Vegas. The gym is nasty. Carpet ripped and stained equipment not kept up dirty. Had to complain several times about the 90 degree hot air blowing there before they fixed it. No sanitary wipes to wipe down the equipment nada. They have a shuttle but you must have to be a female or say you have to be at the airport to get any kind of service. It is offered every half hour so they say. Front gave staffer gave my husband 20 bucks for shuttle bus staffer forgetting him and calling a cab. Ridiculous. The manager here told me he couldn't help me because I booked the reservation through PRICELINE. What that has to do with poor service I don't know. Again ridiculous. I would book at staybridge. Better TA reviews and balconies there. OH don't plan on washing your clothes here most of machines broke. Front desk person says she knows nothing about that. Apparently she works here. Tried to call corp hdqts hold time toooo long. Poor performance here! Don't waste your time! Oh utensils terrible dull old. They had to find cooking utensils and equipment.</p><br></body></html>
