<html><head><h3>Residence Inn Las Vegas South Hotel Reviews Page 13</h3></head><body><br>Quality and service<p>Under Brian's (G.M.) supervision, this hotel has fulfilled all our expectations. The staff is fully dedicated to meet guests' needs and comfort in every aspect of what one would normally expect from a stay in a Residence Inn Marriott. The shuttle service to and from the Strip is a real plus for those who choose not to bother driving around.</p><br>Awsome, very clean rooms<p>Staff very friendly and rooms very clean. I really enjoyed my stay here and would recommend to friends. Courtesy bus drivers were very helpful and timely. Close to Strip and good dining and shopping at Town Square.</p><br>Marriott Appreciation<p>Residence Inn Las Vegas South greets Us each return visit with smiles, by Name and a personal comment from their reception staff Dhessie and Management Omar. They truly make you feel welcome and always ask how they may assist you. This working trip brought extra smiles from Us, as Richard had researched and made genuine Brauts and Kraut for the...
More </p><br>Great hotel, great service<p>I spent a few months here and it was a very accommodating location, conveniently located off the hustle and bustle of the strip but easily accessible. In the city of lights and glamor where service is king, this place is no exception. Outside of the larger Marriott hotels, as a Platinum member this is the best personal service I have...
More </p><br>Outstanding Personal Service<p>This is my third visit. I do not know how management is able to attract and retain employees dedicated to make you feel like a valued guest. Rooms are immaculately maintained. Associates hover over the breakfast area inquiring if everything is to your liking. The GM actually worked the serving area on a Saturday morning. (Management by example.) Mattresses are...
More </p><br>Excellent Facility, Clean, Convenient and Well-Run<p>Located just across the Interstate from the Strip, this is a very nice alternative to the noise, hustle congestion and high prices of the casino district. If you have a car, any place in Vegas is quickly and easily accessible, including the Airport and car rental facilities. (On foot, however, you're out of luck.) We flew in and out, making...
More </p><br>Great place to stay in Vegas<p>This is an awesome place to stay, easy access to freeway, strip and airport. It is in the quite location. Free brackfast has different choices each day. Staffs are very helpful and professional, especially the front desk Dhessie. She makes your stay more enjoyable.</p><br>Super place to stay<p>This was my first experience at staying at an Residence Inn, and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. We were there for three weeks, and in all that time, I found the staff to be courteous, friendly, helpful and pleasant to be around. We had a two bedroom suite, which was layed out nicely. The daily breakfasts were of good quality...
More </p><br>Good Residence Inn<p>The family arrived on the red eye from Atlanta and we could not wait to check in to our hotel. We stayed one night at the Residence Inn as we were headed to the Grand Canyon the following day. Upon arrival at the hotel, around 2 AM, the night clerk was extremely friendly and efficient at check in. The room...
