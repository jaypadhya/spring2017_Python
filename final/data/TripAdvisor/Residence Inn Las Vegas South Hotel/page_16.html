<html><head><h3>Residence Inn Las Vegas South Hotel Reviews Page 16</h3></head><body><br>Excellent Hotel<p>We recently traveled to Las Vegas, Nevada for our 35th wedding anniversary and stayed at the Marriott Residence, Las Vegas, South. We were greeted by the friendly staff and given our room key. Our room was impeccably clean and the grounds were very well kept.
As our vacation progressed the staff was extremely accommodating and made us feel very welcomed and comfortable. There were shuttle busses from the hotel to the strip and even the drivers were very pleasant.
We would definitely reccomend this hotel to anyone traveling to Las Vegas.</p><br>It was adequate<p>The facility was basic and fine. Our first room was noisy and had food smells and we got another room which was fine. They provided a shuttle to the Mandalay Bay which was helpful although the pickup location was a bit hard to find on the return trip. The price was a bit high given its fairly spartan nature (i.e, Hampton Inn-sih) but the amenities were pretty decent. Was impressed by the kitchen - refrig, stove, dishwasher, microwave, etc. - all nice for extended stays but kinda superfluous for an overnight.
The surrounding area is industrial and had nothing within walking distance to offer plus it was quite difficult to get to.. We missed the initial street, got on the 215 Fwy and had a 20 min drive to get back to it... Ugh ! All in all, I think its location isn't that good, its overall feel is average and I wouldn't want to stay there again on an overnight. It may be suitable for those who want more extended stays, provided they get a better per night deal than we did.</p><br>Not what you are expecting and not walking distance to any casinos.<p>It is fine but the hotel misrepresents itself as being across the street from Mandalay Bay. Technically, yes but it is not walking or right off the strip. I was a little miffed about it as we arrives late and was hoping to walk over to play for an hour or so.

They have a shuttle that runs Til 1 am.

The hotel itself is fine and what you expect for a residence inn. We left primarily on principal even though it was late - just felt that the front desk was far from transparent.

They are not really near (not far) and far from "just off the strip" or "just across the street from Mandalay".</p><br>2nd time as good as the first<p>I had stayed here with family about five years ago and found the hotel to be a great value and very convenient. So when I decided to come to Vegas for a week with 2 other friends, it was the most logical choice. We had a nice 2 bedroom suite which worked perfectly. The room and hotel was very clean and even when it was full, you barely heard anyone in any of the rooms. The only noise was from the planes, but of course we're close to the airport. The complimentary breakfast was great as it was before. My friends who hadn't stayed here before were very impressed with the hotel. Our next trip out here we will definitely be staying here again.</p><br>2nd stay here and both were great<p>This was the 2nd time my husband and I, along with our 2 dogs and my sister, have stayed at this hotel. The 1st was in June 2010. Travelling with dogs, we always stay at Residence Inn's when that's a choice. Since we have a car, we don't need to be on the strip and this hotel is a 5 minute drive to a parking lot at the Tropicana. The 1st time we stayed the air conditioner in our room didn't work and they moved us right away. This time we got a room upgrade which was good for my sister as she had her own room and didn't have to sleep on the sofa bed. The breakfast was standard and good. The only down side were the smokers who thought it was okay to stand right outside the door...can't fault Marriott for the rudeness of others!!!</p><br>Perfect if you do not like cigarette smoke!<p>My wife and I recently discovered this hotel and are very impressed. It is modern, clean and offers a breakfast buffet. What is attractive to us is the non-smoking policy. It is close enough to the strip to enjoy the casinos, restaurants and shows. It offers complimentary internet access, which we use to print boarding passes. It is only a 10 minute drive to the Rent-A-Car Facility at the airport. If you despise constantly smelling and breathing second-hand smoke, the Residence Inn is an excellent option.
Room Tip: Look for a good room rate on the internet (e.g. AAA).

It's only marginally better than an Extended Stay America in my opinion. The mattress seemed quite old when I checked it. And unlike an Extended Stay it was quite pricey.

The fire alarm went off while I was there, but in fairness that was because someone set fire to their breakfast, so good to know that works.</p><br>We would stay again, but facility seemed somewhat 'tired'.<p>This Residence Inn was in a convenient, safe location not too far from the south end of the Strip, with a free scheduled shuttle to the Mandalay Bay. Several other mid-range hotels were next door. We stayed here two nights, one of which had an evening manager’s reception; it wasn’t the best night for us since it was just snack food when we were hoping for a meal. Breakfasts were good, including several different toppings for the waffles. Staff was friendly and helpful. The interior courtyard and pool area was pleasant, although the sitting area with the fireplace was always being used as a smoking location (not sure if they were staff). The rooms were clean, but overall, the hotel interiors felt old and in need of updating. Two computers were available for guests, but the connection was very slow. We would stay here again.</p><br>Decent and no smoke<p>This place is nice but has a few issues.
The worst part is that we accidentally left some expensive under armor and a rain coat in the drawers. We called the next day but they "could not find them." :(
Nicer than cheap strip hotels and no smoke or other casino nonsense.
Service is fair.
AC is loud but we turned it off most of the time.
Breakfast was not bad.
Pool, lounge area and lobby are nice.
Bedrooms in the 2 bedroom units are small but living room is decent size.
2 bedroom units have one full size bed in each room, no queen bed.
Kitchen is handy but beware, they run the dw for only 2 or 3 dishes.
Walk to NYNY / strip is 40 minutes +.
Drive to strip is 5 minutes.
Shuttle service is nice but limited and only goes to Mandalay and NYNY.
Workout room is okay.</p><br>theft of property from my hotel room<p>During my recent stay for the NASCAR event, two sets of passes for the races were stolen from my hotel room. The management staff conducted a cursory investigation into the loss of my tickets and responded by saying "we interviewed the staff members who entered your room and they don't know anything about the missing NASCAR tickets." Really? Stellar job there. Great customer service. I will NEVER vist that hotel again.</p><br></body></html>
