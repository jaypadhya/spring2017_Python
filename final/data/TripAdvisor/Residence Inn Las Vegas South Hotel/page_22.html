<html><head><h3>Residence Inn Las Vegas South Hotel Reviews Page 22</h3></head><body><br>Great place to stay<p>This hotel is south of Mandalay Bay, but not at all walkable to it as maps might suggest. Shuttle runs there every 30 min, which was fine for me, but not my mother. The shuttle takes you to the convention center. It's convenient in and out for the vehicle, but it's a 20 minute walk to the monorail. We did not take the MGM shuttle which runs once per hour. That may be a better bet.

The hotel is clean with large, comfortable rooms. We had a 2 br suite, as we had four people. Pool area is nice. Breakfast was adequate. I'd recommend the hotel to anyone wanting an affordable stay slightly away (but not too far) from all the noise of "the strip".</p><br>A Fantastic Property<p>We were here for a trade show at Mandalay Bay for 5 days. I wanted a clean, reasonably priced hotel and we got it here. We had a two-bedroom suite and it was nice to have two bathrooms for 3 people. I love that all the Marriott properties are completely non-smoking.
There is something for everyone on the extensive breakfast buffet, which included eggs, waffles, fruit, cereal, oatmeal, bagels, donuts, fruit, yogurt and more. We used the hot tub to rejuvenate our weary feet each day after the show.
I saw other travelers noted highway or airport noise; we didn't hear any of that as our room was in the building farthest away from that overlooking the pool.
Everyone was incredibly nice and helpful. Special props to Brooke. I am extremely picky about my hotels and this place exceeded my expectations!</p><br>Loved the Residence Inn<p>My wife, daughter, and I stayed there in April '08.
When we arrived at the hotel on Tuesday, the clerk immediately gave us a free upgrade. Sweet! It was a 2 BR, 2 full bathrooms,
kitchenette, living room, with 3 TV's.
We knew we were going to love this place.
Full breakfast each morning including hot oatmeal and raisins (the traveller's friend).
Each evening, except weekends, the manager had a social with free food such as spaghetti with garlic bread, or nacho chips with salad. So we didn't have to buy much food except if we wanted to eat out.
Later, they added a free lunch at the Courtyard by Marriott next door, but we didn't go there.
The hotel has a shuttle to and from Mandalay Bay every few hrs., so we didn't have to rent a car. Very busy traffic in town.
The hotel was spotless, staff were friendly, weather was beautiful, great pool.
Once you're at Mandalay Bay, the city bus, the Deuce, stops just across the street, then you can tour up and down the Strip by bus. Very handy.
Would we stay there again? Absolutely!
The bigger hotels don't offer as much as this Residence Inn with free breakfast, shuttle, etc.</p><br>Very Nice<p>There were 5 of us total with two rooms. Space was not a problem with the pull out couch. Tthe hotel was very clean and spacious. The breakfast was more than I expected and the food was good. The only problem we had was the interstate was close and we could hear the traffic. However, in Vegas, sleeping was just an option. The shuttle service was nice because, 2 of us decided to drive to the Hoover Damn and the rest went on the shuttle for a day in Vegas. One of them even took the bus to Dowtown Freemont afte rtaking the shuttle to MGM. No one had any problems getting back. Cab service to the hotel was available. I would diffently stay there again.</p><br>It's unanamous....very good hotel<p>One the of nicest Residence Inns that I have stayed at.
Staff could not be nicer! Great rooms, nice little pool
area, big breakfast. Great value in Las Vegas.
Getting around was not a big problem...just take the
free shuttle to MGM and hop the monorail. The only
downside I saw was that the shuttle ends at 1100pm.</p><br>what a New Year's!!!<p>We had a great time staying at the Residence Inn. We booked it for the long New Year's week-end and were very pleased. We were with family so booked the two bedroom unit. There were a few minor things wrong. No dish towels, no sink strainer and the dish washer didn't work quite right but we survived. The hotel is located not too far from the strip. We could have used the shuttle but decided to drive. We parked in New York, New York. Parking is free. We didn't notice the planes landing or the traffic noice. We are from Chicago so city noises don't bother us. We did not hear any noises from the people next to us. The best part of the week-end was the fact that our room faced the strip and we had excellent views of the fireworks. We could see them, hear them and feel them while we stayed warm and our grandson slept. The breakfast buffet was good-lots of food. They do try to close it down on time. I would definitely recommend this Inn to all my friends.</p><br>Very Nice Place!<p>I stayed here over Thanksgiving week from 11/17-11/24. Very nice hotel. This was a visit to my brother who lives in Vegas. We decided to stay here instead of all cramming into their place which we had done before, which made for some very tight accomodations. We booked a 2 bedroom suite on the 3rd floor. Very nice and very clean. The staff was very friendly and helpful even down to the cleaning staff. The breakfast was more than we expected. Scrambled eggs, sausage, home fries, and waffles you make from batter and more! We were very happy with the breakfast. They have a very nice pool area and hot tub, though it got cool later in the week and I wasn't brave enough to try it then. Only issue we had was the noise from the airplanes. Not that it was excessive, but it can be heard, especially at 6am in the morning when they really seem to get going. It's just the location of the hotel in this case. Speaking of location, it's nice they have the complimentary shuttle, though we rented a car. (Use Frank Sinatra Drive!!! It's a great timesaver that runs behind Mandalay Bay , all the way up the strip!) So, will I do it again? Definetly!</p><br>Just an okay stay.<p>We are rewards members and stay almost exclusively at Mariott hotels so I feel we are a good judge of the properties. We were a group of 5 adults (2 couples and one single). We chose the Residence Inn because you cannot beat having 2 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, a sleeper sofa and a full kitchen. The value for the money was fantastic compared to staying on strip where we would have had to have 2-3 rooms, no free breakfast, and no ability to cook some of our meals to save money.
Make no mistake about it - the hotel is definitely off strip. Due to all the recent, and seemingly never-ending, construction in this city we found the location not at all easy to find from the airport. It is in an area not yet finished. Perhaps when it is done it will be more inviting and easier to get to but for now it was a bit of a headache (and I have been to Vegas about 50 times!). We were just here in June and cannot believe the changes since then!
The staff was very friendly and the rooms very clean but, and I apologize to Marriott, it appeared to be one of the cheapest and haphazzardly built hotels built that I have ever stayed at. I did not go in expecting a 5 star luxury suite but the furnishings (especially the kitchen cabinets) looked like they had been salvaged from an older property. I have definitely stayed in more sound proofed rooms on the strip. Luckily our neighbors above us and to the sides of us awoke around the same time as us each day and they were not excessively noisy but had I wanted to sleep late it would have been difficult. We heard every little noise.
I understand they offer free internet in the rooms but we do not like to travel with our computer. For this reason we always make use of Marriotts business centers at their hotels. This property lacked one so when we needed to get online we had to go to an internet cafe.
I know it sounds like we asolutely hated the hotel but actually we did not. It had its faults but if you are looking to stay off strip in an affordable room for a family then this IS the place. We appreciated the lack of hard partying guests. It is near a lot of "non-touristy" stores which we prefer to shop at and had easy access to the freeway which we utilized daily for trips to Death Valley, Hoover Dam, Lake Mead and Red Rock Canyon. We would stay here again if our needs called for this type of hotel.</p><br>Nice but far from the strip<p>We stayed here for a vegas getaway with my family. We had a senior and a child traveling with us and wanted to be somewhere without a casino and tons of smoke.
This is a great property. We had a 2 bedroom suite on the 3rd floor 340 I believe was the number. It was very spacious, plenty of room for 4 people. Breakfast was ok...Fruit, yogurt, milk, juice, eggs, sausage, make your own waffles. They also had a nacho/salad buffett on Thursday evening. The staff was very nice and helpful with directions and area advice. The pool are was nice and quiet. The room was a blah neutral decor but VERY clean.
There was only one drawback at the property.....you are in the flight path for McCarren airport and there is a lot of plane traffic day and night. If you are a light sleeper this may be a problem. I was so exhausted when we hit the room I could have fallen asleep next to a freight train.
This is a great place if you do not mind being away from the strip and the hustle and bustle of the casinos. Would we stay here again? Most likely no, but not because of ANYthing to do with the property or staff...they were the best. But it was to far from the strip for us. So if you do not mind being a little way away this is the place for you.</p><br>great hotel - wonderful front desk help<p>Great location right off the interstate with quick easy access to the strip hotels. I'm handicapped and arrived alone.
The help at the front desk were simply wonderful and helped me into my room with the wheelchair and luggage. They couldn't have been nicer. Two bedroom was very nice (I do wish Residence Inns would have one bdrm with two beds when you book a 2 bedrm as sharing a queen is not always comfortable but this is all Residence Inns and nothing against this property).</p><br></body></html>
