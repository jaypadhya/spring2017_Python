<html><head><h3>Residence Inn Las Vegas South Hotel Reviews Page 21</h3></head><body><br>Left After First Night<p>We were scheduled to stay at this Residence Inn for two nights. We checked out early in the morning after our first night and moved to the Residence Inn Green Valley, which was a huge improvement.

When we checked into our room at Residence Inn South, we found a note on the counter from the housekeeping service, to a prior guest, stating the room was not made up due to the "privacy" sign on the door. Obviously someone had made up the room, because the bed was made etc., but they had not cleaned well (as evidence by the housekeeping note still being on the counter) and the carpet had not been thoroughly vaccumed.

When we went into the bathroom, their was hair on the tub and the floor. Yikes. I hate a dirty bathroom! It turns my stomach to check into a room with an unclean bathroom.

We called the front desk and the staff person apologized and immediately moved us to another and larger room, which was appreciated. However, we still found the room in general to look worn and give an appearance of not being very clean (due to the worn nature of the carpet , tile around the tub etc.)

I was then waiting iniside the building door where our room was located, for my daughter to come from her car into the building. A group of four people (two couples) who were guests, entered the door with their key, looked at me and called me a "dumb [--]." I had not spoken to them and was simply standing in the entry way. I reported the incident and requested security take some extra strolls through our building. The staff person whom I spoke with told me he would inform the manager but we never had a responsive call from the manager.

We shortly realized that this hotel was located in an area where we could not walk around to restaurants or shops. The nearest grocery store, per the front desk, was an 8 minute drive. There were no restaurants or shops around. The hotel is located on what was previously known as "Industrial Drive" and it definitely is in a more industrial location, even though you can see the strip from the hotel.

The breakfast area is very small, about half the size of the normal Residence Inn. It made it very "tight" seating in the morning.

We also inquired of the front desk if they had a cork screw to open a bottle of wine we had purchased. The staff person was very polite and informed us there was not one anywhere in the hotel but he could call the Court Yard hotel next door and have one brought over but it would take 20 minutes. After 30 minutes we called again and were told the Court Yard hadn't yet responded. We gave up.

We found this just wasn't the right place for what we were looking for. We moved over to the Residence Inn Green Valley and loved it.

The staff at Residence Inn South were all polite and friendly, but the location and housekeeping in the hotel were poor.</p><br>Don't leave anything behind<p>While the stay here was okay, be sure you don't leave anything behind because you'll probably never see it again. I left a jacket and sweater in the front closet of the room and notified the property as soon as I returned home. The items could not be located. How can a jacket and sweater disappear?? I won't be going back!</p><br>Good but over-ranked on tripadvisor<p>I stay at a lot of Marriott properties all over the world (platinum rewards member). I like Marriott because there is always a minimum level of comfort I've come to expect no matter where I stay. This location was decent but overall I don't think it deserves the "top 20" ranking it has in Las Vegas.

PROS: The property is very new, and the grounds are well kept. The location is not on the Strip, but is convenient to get there by car or the hotel shuttle. The room I had was a standard Residence Inn studio king, in fact it was an exact replica of the layout I've seen at other Residence Inns and it was nice. The front desk staff were nice and the hotel breakfast was above average for a Residence Inn (eggs, potatoes, do-it-yourself breakfast burritos, and the usual fruit and breads). The area was quiet at night, and there is no casino on site so the hotel really does "sleep" late at night.

CONS: The room I had was not as clean as it should have been. Hairs scattered around the bathroom floor and tub, and the toilet seat was...not shiny. The bed was much firmer than I expected, I didn't sleep well.

Overall I would recommend it for a family with multi-bedroom needs or someone on an extended stay in Las Vegas. For the money though there are other Marriott properties (Renaissance Las Vegas maybe) that I would try first.</p><br>Top Marks<p>I was amazed to read the review posted a couple of days ago. I am in Las Vegas on vacation with my husband staying at the Residence South for the first time. We stay around 100 nights a year in everything from log cabins to smart hotels and I can say that my impression of this hotel, from the upgrade at reception to the excellent appearance of the place as we went to our suite to the amazing cleanliness of our rooms was one of the best I have had.

Everything, everywhere seems spotless. Even my kitchen sink shone! Bathrooms gleamed. The kitchen and everything in it was pristine.

One wonders where the reviewer stayed before and what she brought to Vegas in their luggage.

Me, I'll definitely stay here again.</p><br>BITTEN BY BED BUGS!<p>I have stayed at many Residence Inns over the years. But this was the stay from HELL!
I was driving my 91 year old mother from Boise, ID to San Diego to visit family for Christmas.
We had a two room suite. At about 10 pm I got into bed. A few minutes later I saw a small black bug on my pillow. Thinking it might be a spider I just flicked it away. A few minutes later I felt a bite on my shoulder and brushed by hand across the spot. A larger black bug hit the sheet next to be, burst open and left a spatter of my blood on the sheet. As I was jumping out of bed a second bite happened and I did the same thing with the same result, another bug and a blood spot on the sheet.. Once I was out of bed I was able to see many of these vile creatures on the white sheets.
Because of their size I thought they were ticks and only learned that they were not when I had them inspected by a lab in Boise on my return. They confirmed that they were in fact bed bugs and that they did exist in that size.
The only good news was that I was not exposed to any disease.
That night, I called the office and told them to find me another suite. I had to wake my sleeping mother and move all of our stuff to another room and even after taking a shower still felt itchy. I inspected the sheets in the new room and found nothing but I remained itchy for several days, in spite of showering twice a day.
I find it amazing that a hotel of this supposed quality would have bed bugs! I have never experienced this before, anywhere!
It was a really gross experience and needless to say, I would not stay at this hotel again.
I was told by the inspecting lab here in Boise that the only way to get rid of them was to do a massive extermination, and I don't know if this was done after I left. My massive, they meant the entire hotel, not just the room. I was also told to check my luggage, and bedding at home, very carefully, because I may have brought them home with me. Fortunately thid did not happen, but I could have been exposed to these bugs and worse, my mother may have brought them back to her retirement home and infected that whole place.
This is inexcusable. I will never get into bed in a hotel without first checking the bedding VERY, VERY carefully.
It ruined the entire trip.</p><br>Great Experience. Would definitely stay here again!!!<p>Went to LV over Memorial Day Weekend. We stayed one night at the Residence Inn. I booked a 2 Bedroom/2Bath. Went with another couple AND our 2 very clean small Dogs!! I stress clean because you would be surprised how grossed out non pet owners are when they find out that a hotel actually accepts pets. At any rate, this particular Residence Inn is fairly new and very modern and clean. The 2 Bedroom is like an apartment with a big kitchen and T.V's in both bedrooms along with the livingroom. The free buffet breakfast was great. I highly recommend this place to anyone. It was quiet and clean. I do have to agree with a previous reviewer regarding the shuttle. The shuttle does drop you off at Mandalay Bay and I believe the MGM. However, it stops at 11:00PM, but you can always take a taxi back to the hotel. It is a great perk but I am not a shuttle person. I am too independant and don't like to wait. If you aren't planning on drinking heavily than take your own car. ALL the major hotels on the strip have FREE parking gargages in the back of each hotel. You DON'T have to Valet and pay if you don't want.</p><br>Quiet, clean, smoke free hotel close to the LV Strip<p>I had read almost all the reviews of the top 40 hotels. Many were good and I was tempted to choose several other hotels first before coming around to the Residence Inn. I'm very glad I chose this hotel over all the others. I will expand on the other reviews I had read based on my new direct experience with the hotel. We got a suite with 2 bedrooms and central area with fridge + stove + dish washer + fireplace + microwave oven + 3 tvs. Benefits: (1) 'Building B' looked brand new and spotless, (2) totally smoke free hotel, (3) as a computer person, the free highspeed was indeed 'high speed' except around 10pm each night when it became too slow to use for an hour or so, (4) cost was the same or cheaper than the hotels on the strip or anywhere else nearby, (5) highway and 'Las Vegas Strip' car access is just excellent once you know the back-entrace method, (6) lots of ample parking, (7) good room service, (8) free breakfast with eggs + waffles & milk/juice/coffee, (9) fairly quiet except one afternoon of airplanes landing further south of the hotel and 2 car alarms going off, (10) small fitness center + basketball area, (11) pool + smaller spa pool + waterfall - only the spa pool was heated - no one was in either one all week so the pool area was quiet for all to use. If you prefer peace and quiet then this is the place to go, but it does not have the hussle and bussle of any LV strip hotel (nor the smoke!).

I had picked up a lot of good advice on this forum in reading the reviews from the other 40 hotels, so let me offer some of my own advice: (1) Being in LV before, having a car is an excellent and cost savings way to get around town and to get groceries, (2) We went to 3 buffets: Stratosphere Courtyard, Desert Rose and Sam's Town - everyone said to go to Sam's Town but it was the most disappointing in selection and price ($60 for 2 people and one child at night); Stratosphere had the best selection of the 3 and the lowest price - however, all 3 didn't come close to the average buffets I go to each week in Toronto, (3) 'Town Center' is a new-style shopping complex close to the hotel by car - go east on Russel Road, Las Vegas Blvd South and it is on your right side about 3min down the strip, close to Hwy 215/15 interchange - has Fry's Electronics, food store, etc. (4) here is some golden advice for car access to the hotel: access the hotel from 'Russel Road' - go west from Las Vegas Blvd (south of Mandalay Bay) or get off at the Russell Road I15 exit, go over the bridge (west) and immediately turn left (south) _after_ the traffic lights in a little opening in the road median, go 200' south and the Residence Inn's back door will be on your left before the end of this street. The front of the hotel sits on Dean Martin Drive which parallels I15 all the way north to the Stratosphere where it turns into Industrial Road. Don't drive on the slow Las Vegas Blvd before 11pm - use Dean Martin Drive, Frank Sinatra Drive or just get on/off I15 at Tropicana/Flamingo/Sahara exits to quickly access any part of the strip without waiting at lots of slow traffic lights, (5) my wife took the shuttle many times over to Mandalay Bay or further on to Town Center shopping mall, which runs every 30mins. You could probably walk over to Mandalay Bay via the 'back road' of the hotel + Russel Street brige in 15mins or so.

I had also made an extensive list of things to do with my family during our one week. Here's the recommended ones: (1) For sure, go to the 'Red Rock Canyon' which is at the west-most rim of the mountains near Las Vegas - at look-out point # 1 we journeyed down to the orange canyon walls where were formed by shifting sand dunes 160mil years ago, (2) Boulder Dam + Boulder City = one day tour and we did the more expensive tour right inside the dam walls, (3) one of the nicest hotels to visit since my last trip 12 years ago is Caesar's Palace, (4) The Freemont Street Experience was worth seeing (make sure you see both shows), (5) there is a downtown art show the first Friday evening of each month, (6) Friday and Saturday nights have a planetarium show at CCSN, (7) the LUXOR's entertainment floor is disappointing compared to what it was like 10-12 years ago.</p><br>perfect<p>Now this is what a room should be. Separate bedroom so I can sleep while my mate can watch Tv, computer, cook....very quiet. We stayed here twice. Once a separate bedroom then four days later a suite with two bedrooms so my sister could be with us before she went to airport the next morning. My husband slept through the night and so did I....WOW</p><br>Best place to stay with your family<p>Because we have 3 teenagers, the Residence Inns come in handy. We stayed in a 2 bedroom suite. Worth the price compared to getting 2 separate rooms. The pool was very nice and cool on hot August night. The shuttle to Mandalay Bay is awesome, used it every night. The breakfast in the morning was good, the coffee was even better. I found the hotel to be very clean and the security in the parking lot is nice. Same complex as a Holiday Inn Express and a Courtyard. Always a nice stay at the Residence Inn. Also, free Internet service in the rooms.</p><br>Fantastic Residence Inn except for Managers Reception<p>We stayed here for 3 nights in August.

My husband and I loved the quiet ambience of this hotel after having spent hours at or nearby the Strip. The 2-bedroom-suite was great, as almost always with the Residence Inns. Nice, clean, comfortable. We had asked for a quiet room not facing the I 15, which was a good decision. No noise at all. The nearby airport was no problem to us. During daytime we could see the planes starting and passing the hotel nearby, it was quite interesting to watch them. And during nighttime there was no noice at all.

Our kids - teens - of course would have preferred a hotel at the Strip. But still they also liked the comfort and beautifuness of this hotel.

Especially the gardenarea with the pool is just brilliant. It is wonderful to stay there and have a relaxing time in and around the pool. It was very very hot during our stay (around 110 degree) so it was great to find the pool being really fresh and very very clean!!!

We did use the shuttle-service to and from the MGM-hotel, also to the Mandalay. From there we used taxis several times, f.ex. to get to the Hard Rock Cafe, which really is too far away from the Strip to walk. From the strip its around 15-25 USD by taxi back to the hotel.

During our vacation we noticed that the Residence Inns do not have Mon-Thursday-Managers Receptions any more. They've cut that service to Mon/Wed/Thursday-Receptions, at some places even less, just twice a week. OK. If one knows that, no problem. But if they offer a reception, they really should offer one. That really was the only bad thing we found at this Residence Inn. For the Monday we stayed there they had announced a reception but when we got there (and would have liked to have had a glass of wine or beer before using the shuttle to the MGM) we really were surprised to find almost nothing. Nothing to eat except for some fruit salat and just a few undefinable juices? No wine, no beer??? Hey, this was Las Vegas??? The management should better abstain from a reception like that. Because that wasn't one!

Apart from this the Residence Inn Las Vegas South was the best and most beautiful Residence Inn we have ever stayed at.</p><br></body></html>
