<html><head><h3>Residence Inn Las Vegas South Hotel Reviews Page 9</h3></head><body><br>Indiana traveler<p>This place is just wonderful! Staff is so friendly and caring! Great free shuttle to Mandalay Bay and from there you can catch tram, buses, cabs. Hotel is smoke free, calm and relaxing, well cared for and very clean. Pool is so great-you have no idea you're minutes away for the strip. Rooms were great, food wonderful and entire staff went above and beyond to make sure we were happy. This was our second stay at this residence Inn-both times for a week and we're actually heading back in a few weeks. Can't wait to get back to this Residence Inn!
Room Tip: We like to stay on top floor in building 2. Rooms very quiet and clean. Looked like the furnishing...

The stay itself was great but unfortunately I had a bad experience after leaving. I left a couple of blouses in the closet. I admit it was my own fault. I realized this immediately and called from the airport and was told I had to call back. I called back about three hours later and was told I needed to call the next day. I called back 4 times the following day. One of those times I was forwarded to the managers voice mail where I left a message and asked for a return call. Each time I called I was asked for my number and was told someone would return my call. Okay- I probably was dreaming to even think my property would be returned but I certainly didn't need the run around. A simple "Sorry we didn't find it" from the beginning would have been preferred. I have always left a good tip for the house keeper. Maybe that won't happen anymore!!
Room Tip: Dont leave anything upon your departure!!
See more room tips</p><br>Much better than expected<p>Even though it had good reviews I didn't expect it to live up to the expectations, but it exceeded expectations. Was very impressed by the level of service that the staff delivered. Everyone was pleasant and cordial. Our points stay was upgraded to a 2 b-room suite, 2nd floor which was perfect for our family of 4. Didn't have a view, but who cares. Couldn't hear any h-way or airport traffic even through it was right next to us. The beds were as comfortable as can be expected (come on, theres' nothing like home, am I right?). 3 TV's and 4 people, so no complaint there. Full kitchen was nice and clean. The housekeeping even did the dishes for us and we were more than happy to leave a $5 daily tip for their hard work (common courtesy folks), especially considering it was a free stay. The shuttle bus was on time, but we decided to drive to the strip (free parking at nearly every mega hotel). Glad we did because it is a long walk between hotels. Breakfast was decent, but the staff really sold it, they all say GM and IS EVERYTHING OK? Makes a big difference. Nice choice of eggs, potatoes, breakfast meat (sausage or canadian bacon each day) and breakfast sandwiches. Even our picky 12 YO daughter found something she liked. Didn't use the pool, kind of chilly on our visit, but it looked clean and well kept. They were actually testing the water when we were there, so no doubt it is well maintained. Marriott should bottle whatever they are doing with the staff at this property and spread it to all their properties. Their guests and stockholders would be very happy. Stay here if you like to be treated well, stay on the strip if you just want to be treated like cattle in the vast corral that LV has become.</p><br>Decently priced, good breakfast, and good location(for families)<p>I wouldn't say this is the best Marriott you'll spend your money on. But, it was what you would expect from a Marriott. The service was great from the staff, the breakfast was good, and the location is nice for younger families who need a break from the strip atmosphere.
I've stayed at the Residence Inn at the Hughes Center, and this one seemed better to me on all accounts. But, both are in need of some room updates. It's interesting because you drive up to the hotel, and it looks new and nice on the outside. But, the rooms are just a little old and almost gave me that 'budget' hotel feel.
Again, the staff were great and had the room prepared how we asked before we arrived. I had no issues at all while I was there. Well, there was one issue.
One thing to consider if you're a light sleeper is the noise of airplanes taking off from Mccarran Airport. That woke me up in the morning, and basically prevented me from sleeping that well once that began. They take off every couple of minutes. So, not a good thing if you would like a good night's sleep. Maybe I was in a bad location of the hotel, but I can't imagine the sound was any better in another section of the hotel.
I can't necessarily speak for the single, vegas-goer. But, I actually like the Springhill Suites Marriott a little better. The Springhill Suites has much better breakfast options(can you tell I really like food?), better pool, and much cleaner and modern feeling rooms. This Residence Inn has much better parking though. And, you get a one-bedroom for about the same price as the Springhill Suites.
This is assuming you don't have or don't want to spend money on the 'nicer' category of Marriotts in the area like the Cosmopolitan(It is a Marriott). I've stayed at the Cosmo as well, and it's awesome. But, not worth the money if you're there with a young family.</p><br>A quiet place away from the Strip!!<p>Our stay was excellent from the moment we arrived to the moment we left. Everything was clean, the suites are amazing. The staff is friendly and helpful. The location is not so great but we wanted some quiet time off the strip so the location was something we were looking for. Then have shuttles running in every 30 min to Mandalay Bay and NYNY. so if you need to go to the strip anytime you always have a way out.

I loved the morning breakfast!!!

We can't wait to visit again. Had a great time. ..</p><br>Great staff, property needs some TLC<p>My husband and I stayed at this Residence Inn to attend the Interbike Trade show held at the Mandalay Bay Convention Center. The location for our purpose was excellent and we appreciated the prompt & courteous shuttle service to the Shark Reef entrance. It was literally a breath of fresh air to stay at a non-smoking and non-casino hotel.

The staff at this hotel is second to none. We never passed a single employee, from the front desk to housekeeping, without encountering a greeting. Brian has an exceptional team of employees.

The property itself could use a bit of attention. When I checked in, we were "upgraded" to a one bedroom unit from a studio suite. Unfortunately, the one bedrooms do not have a king size bed, and the walls make the space quite cramped, so it wasn't a plus. Upon getting to the assigned one bedroom, it smelled damp and moldy. The carpet in the corner of the bedroom by the a/c closet was literally white (the carpet color was dark green if I recall.) I went back to the desk and they promptly assigned me a 4th floor studio with a king, the room I had a reservation for (and supposed guaranteed bed type as an Elite.) It was much better than the one bedroom.

The property itself is showing quite a bit of wear & tear. Carpets in the hallways were ripped and literally threadbare in places. Sheets on our bed had several holes. Our iron didn't work although one call and a new one was promptly delivered. The keycard entry to our building was quite touchy and often it took several (as in 5+) swipes to gain entry to the building.

Breakfast was wonderful and the hotel made use of an adjoining meeting room to set up the waffle station, eliminating some of the congestion at the breakfast buffet. All of the breakfast staff was pleasant and helpful.

Upon checkout, my final bill was incorrect. Apparently when I was "upgraded" at check-in, my nightly rate went up by $10. Whoops. If I didn't know my quoted rate and draw the clerks attention to the error, I would have been overcharged. To his credit, Brian (the G.M.) assisted the clerk to take off the additional charge and correct the taxes. He stated that he looked at my reservation and saw in the history the accidental rate adjustment due to the "upgrade" (that I didn't want in the first place.) I'm going with the hope this was an honest mistake, but it left a bad taste for me.

So to sum it up: pleasant staff, non-smoking, non-gaming, convenient to Mandalay Bay option with spacious accommodations and includes parking, internet & breakfast.</p><br>Great place to stay in Vegas<p>We had a very nice stay. Getting a free breakfast was a definite plus for us as we tend to sleep late and we didn't have to go far for breakfast. The staff was so helpful and friendly they made us feel welcome. Taking a shuttle to the beautiful Vegas hotels was such a great perk. Like all hotels there are a few problems, buy hey, no one and nothing is perfect. If you go with the attitude that you'll enjoy yourself and overlook minor details, you'll have a great time.</p><br>Perfect place to stay if you want to have a nice relaxing time and enjoy the hustle and bustle of the vegas strip!<p>I stayed here with my dad from sept 8-12 as my dad was attending a convention in vegas. All the staff was friendly and courteous. The free breakfast was amazing! But i would have to say the best part of it would be the shuttle service they run to mandalay bay n new york new york. Shuttle was always on time, drivers were super friendly. All in all i had a great stay n will def stay here the next time im visiting vegas!!</p><br>Best staff of any hotel<p>We gave this Residence Inn an "excellent" across the board because the staff made it so incredibly pleasant we can overlook the areas that need improvement. Big thank you's to Omar and Eloisa at the front desk, Tuy in the breakfast room and Frank the shuttle driver to New York New York casino. The property is lovely, right off the highway and just down from Mandalay Bay. The room is like an apartment with a full kitchen. The bed was very comfortable. The free breakfast was outstanding with lots of choices including a fresh crock of oatmeal and waffles with strawberries and whipped cream. Really good coffee. On Tues, Wed and Thurs nights they have a delicious reception with beautiful salads and appetizers that we turned into dinner. This is an old Residence Inn and is in desperate need of new carpet in the hallways, new door locks on the exterior doors (sometimes we had to swipe our card 15 times before it opened), and the jacuzzi needs cleaning, but the people who work at this hotel were so friendly and helpful and nice that we would stay here again in a heartbeat.</p><br>Wonderful Service<p>Stayed at The Marriott Residence Inn South for a week and we were very impressed with the service. The staff from front desk to housekeeping were very friendly and always eager to please. We had a 2 bedroom suite and it was very clean and spacious . The pool was nice and clean. The hot breakfast buffet was good and for me the location off the strip was perfect to relax after spending the day at the casinos. Overall a great experience, good value for the money and I would definitely stay here again!</p><br></body></html>
