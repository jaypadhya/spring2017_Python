<html><head><h3>Residence Inn Las Vegas South Hotel Reviews Page 3</h3></head><body><br>Not the best Marriott experience.<p>I want a few things in a hotel room including that it be clean, quiet, and maintained. As such, Marriott often meets these requirements, which is why I am a returning customer. This time my experience fell short. I was locked out of my room several times, including at late night, as my entry cards stopped working. After several times of back and forth, it was determined that the wrong expiration date was entered at my registration. The receptionist really tried to be helpful even bringing a new card to my room after letting me in directly. Unfortunately, this occurred again. More annoying was the bed that appeared to be broken down and would tilt. This wasn't something I wanted to spend time dealing with at late night. It occurred to me that every employee that made the bed would have seen this issue, but nobody cared enough to proactively resolve. I told the receptionist when I checked out early so the next person wouldn't have to tolerate this and got the standard robotic sorry response. It is unlikely I'll stay here again...</p><br>Near Airport<p>I normally love staying at the Residence Inns. Their breakfasts are always nice. I knew that we were in the part of town near the airport but didn't expect the airport noise to go on until 2:00 am. Our room faced the airport and I heard the planes taking off over our building. The Billboard Awards had taken place that night in Vegas. I think that there might have been more private planes leaving Vegas that night than usual. The air conditioner was also noisy. My friends were staying in another part of the hotel and did not experience either of these issues. My recommendation is to not stay in a room facing the airport.</p><br>Great Stay! Fantastic People<p>My wife, elderly father in law, and I stayed four nights, Sunday night thru and including Wednesday night. The room met the high standards of Marriott, as did the breakfast buffet. One of the two front desk staff that we saw during our stay was particularly good because he attempted to assist with my question about getting discounts on shows, and followed up with me the next two days. Loved the free shuttle that went to Mandalay Bay (twice and hour) and the one that went to Arias (once an hour.) The hotel is located just off strip from Mandalay Bay, close enough to the strip so we knew we were in Las Vegas, but far enough away to avoid the congestion, and avoid the outrageous cost of the strip hotels. And even though it is in the flight path of the airport, I don't recall hearing any of the planes unless I stood right next to the window. I would definitely stay here again.
Room Tip: We chose a suite that had two separate bedrooms. It had a nice living room, and of course being a R...

Room Tip: Ask for a quiet room, since it is close to the airport.

And each year I'm blown away by their top notch service. Just off the strip yet seems like a world away from the smoke and hubbub of the strip. This hotel runs free shuttles every 30 mins to the strip. Beds so comfy. Great free breakfast and a staff that smiles all the time and do everything they can to make your stay awesome. Love this place!
Room Tip: Highly recommend 2 berm with 2 baths. So wonderfully roomy. Ask for quiet room on back side which is...
See more room tips</p><br>A great place to stay in Vegas<p>I returned after staying here last year. The accommodations and staff are top notch. The property is very nice but it is the customer service that brings me back. I was happy to see Gerry still here as he is the model of customer service, who was the primary reason I returned for a month. The kitchen staff Ruby and Lilly are wonderful and a special thanks to Moises Ambriz, the GM who helped me out. This hotel is just across the freeway from the strip but far enough away to avoid the nightly craziness. It is only 10-15 minutes from the airport. Perfect location with quick access to all the attractions Las Vegas has to offer and if your working here you couldn't ask for a better hotel. Again thank you to the staff.</p><br>Oustanding accommodations off the strip!<p>Loved all of the amenities that this hotel offered! The free breakfast saved time and money. A free shuttle to the strip with connections to the tram kept us from driving in Vegas traffic. Monday through Wednesday happy hour provided wonderful food and ability to interact with staff. The staff went above and beyond to be helpful! Night manager Jerry was great and Brenda, a trainee from Vacaville, CA, was superb!
Room Tip: Two bedroom suites near the pool were amazingly quiet and easily accessible! Reasonably priced and...
See more room tips</p><br>It's a great motel<p>For low budget stays in Las Vegas there are nice things about this hotel. Free shuttle to some of the casinos every 30 minutes, beautiful pool and deck area, friendly staff (except the breakfast cook who always wore that "I dare you - just say a word!" look) and clean rooms. It's not the newest hotel room, but it is clean, not run down and tired, adequate furnishings, lighting, wifi, fridge, cooktop and microwave oven, dishwasher, coffee percolator, nice windows for natural light and air, air conditioning.

This is not a luxury hotel. They are pet friendly also so if you're traveling with a canine friend that's awesome too. Even though the rooms were quite nice they were currently renovating and painting and installing updated stainless steel appliances during my stay. Plenty of amenities - check their web site for that.

Free WiFi is always welcome. About the only negative for this hotel would be its "food" offerings. Breakfast was nice but had a limited selection. There's no restaurant in this hotel and none within walking distance, so eat out before retiring to the hotel for the night.

If you're not expecting a luxury hotel, this is nice and quiet but still close to The Strip. You'll need transportation of some sort because its not walking distance from anything.

Still, I enjoyed my stay., even though I'm used to staying in the fancy hotels on the Strip. However, I'd not bring my spouse here because I value here more than that and would want to show that. :-)
Room Tip: Eat your meals elsewhere.
See more room tips</p><br>Great if you want kitchen<p>I'd stayed here since a month and my experience has been good. Got two bed room and its good. Breakfast is good, but for Indians, nothing great, except for bread type foods.

No taxi's available in front of hotel. This is important to remember.

Kitchen is good with all utensils.

Place is calm.
Room Tip: No taxi available in front. Plan accordingly.
See more room tips</p><br>Super cool, like Dean Martin himself<p>All the places on The Strip wanted to valet park our car, which we did not want since we were on two-month vacation with lots of stuff we needed to retrieve from time to time without some stuffy process of tipping some valet to bring your car so you could grab those corn chips or champagne flutes or whatever you left in the trunk....

Beyond finding this really cool place just off The Strip (on Dean Martin Dr), where we could actually interact with our vehicle during our weeklong stay, we discovered Residence Inn by Marriott. Never before have we had the luxury of not only a suite, but also a full size stove WITH OVEN, along with full size fridge and full size dishwasher. All in a really nice posh building and guest rooms.

On top of that, the front desk crew of this just off the strip (but has free shuttle bus) hotel was top notch. Crystal was outgoing and welcoming, and every other person we saw behind the front desk was super friendly and caring. Even the older lady who was helping with the Mon to Weds free early evening appetizers was a first rate hospitality professional.

We are impressed with this location and crew. You took a good trip to Vegas and made it a great trip. Thanks! Very reasonable rate as well!
Room Tip: top floor corner suite if possible
