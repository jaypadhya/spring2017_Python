<html><head><h3>Residence Inn Las Vegas South Hotel Reviews Page 11</h3></head><body><br>Great<p>If you are staying in Vegas for an extended amount of time and do NOT want to stay on the strip but close then I would highly recommend this hotel. Rooms are very clean and kept that way. You have everything you need (full kitchen) plus plenty of room. The breakfast is always great and the staff is always helpful. If you want to go to the strip there is a shuttle that comes every hour and drops you off/picks you up.

The only downside is it's close to the airport and sometimes the noise from planes taking off and landing is a bit much.</p><br>room was clean<p>good breakfast and room was nice. Los of kids at the pool so I didn't utilize it. breakfast was very nice. I wish three room could have been cooler.hard to figure out the tv channels but overall it was nice. the advertisement for pizza delivery was outdated</p><br>great stay, great staff<p>this hotel is a must stay with families in Las Vegas. it's very close to the strip, but far enough away that the children are in a good location. The hotel rooms are typical high Marriott quality with breakfast served daily and dinner served several nights a week. The pool has a rock waterfall that the children can jump from. There are plenty of lounge chairs in plenty of shade for those hot days. The hotel staff was fabulous and went the extra mile to be helpful.</p><br>Typical excellent Residence Inn with a couple of minor exceptions<p>We stayed for a week in a 2-bedroom suite in Bldg B on the top floor facing the courtyard; a quiet location with a north face, thus reducing sunlight in the morning and holding down heat during the day. Very attentive staff, starting with manager Bryan Zeitlin and everyone we encountered. Good breakfast; the scrambled eggs tasted like somebody just made them from scratch. Very good 7/24 coffee. Everything is clean and bright. The housekeeping staff was good and left us little notes each time.

Now to the minor exceptions .. the mattresses were OK but may be nearing the end of their useful life and intermittent air conditioner noise both from the room's unit as well as exterior to the room might be a concern for light sleepers - Bryan is aware of this and says it is being rectified.

Also of note is the lack of a king bed in either bedroom, but we knew that before we made the reservation.

We have stayed at many of the hotels in town and found this to be a delightful alternative with a full kitchen, free breakfast, room to move around, and no resort fees. Highly recommended and we will stay at this Residence Inn the next time we are in Las Vegas.
Room Tip: see review
See more room tips</p><br>Friendly staff but rooms need updating<p>The hotel is in a couple of different buildings near I â€“ 15. Try to get a room in building B which is further from the freeway. There was some airplane noise too in the morning. The rooms are typical for a residence Inn but the furnishings need updating. Our mattress felt like a sponge and the air conditioning made more noise than a submarine. Also, the curtains let in a lot of light during the morning. The staff was very helpful though, and they had lots of shuttles around the Las Vegas area.</p><br>Excellent Service<p>Right from the get go, Asst. General Mgr. Richard Abraham Aguila has been exceptional in his service and assistance.
We visited Las Vegas as a couple for the first time for the Memorial Weekend. The road trip was great and upon reaching the hotel it was even better.
Spacious rooms and pleasant decor was very pleasant.
As always the service is what we are most concerned and we left Las Vegas very happy.
Thanks Richard</p><br>Not my favorite<p>Marriott properties are usually held to great standards, but this hotel was just meh. The room was ok, clean, and a good size. But the furniture and decor was SO outdated! Breakfast again was ok, not great, but the kitchen staff was pleasant. The evening housekeeping was TERRIBLE, took hours to get more towels and other toiletries. The only positive worth mentioning was the front desk girl Stephanie. She was always smiling, polite, and took care of anything I needed. Especially when housekeeping didn't get it done. Thank you, Stephanie.</p><br>Nice to be away from casinos and ridiculous "resort fees"<p>Marriott properties are usually consistent and quite nice. This is no exception with all that you would expect from a Residence Inn...makes business travels to Vegas SO easy.
Large 2b/r suite with great a/c and ample living area. 3 flat screens give everyone a choice. Living room furniture a little on the cheap side, but adequate.
Bathrooms were very good with large spaces and clean throughout. Great lighting and good water pressure helped here.
Great beds and pillows knocked me out after crazy business days.
Breakfast was average Marriott chain fare and met expectations.
My only complaint would be the multiple stains on the bed skirts (ick) and the dated styling...I prefer a more up-to-date contemporary feel.
Well worth spending a bit extra to be away from crowds, casinos, smoke, crazy parking, and long treks to your room.</p><br>Hotel<p>Everything about this hotel was VERY CLEAN. The manager Bryan and his assistant Rich were very helpful in everything I asked of them.Also the women at the front desk were very helpful.when I needed help with the internet with shows and airline confirmations. But I saved the best for last. Christina, the woman who sets up all the food in the morning always greeted me with a BIG SMILE and sometimes even a hug.She started my day with a ray of sunshine. Always had a nice word and smile. If I could, I'd give her a BIG RAISE.She earns it every day. I will come back here and tell all my friends about this place. 5 STARS PS: the shuttle driver was great. Give him a good tip.</p><br>A Great Stay Off the Strip.<p>This was a very pleasant surprise. The hotel was just minutes from the trip with shuttles running regularly into the early morning hours. We used them 4 times and they were on time. The staff was quite pleasant and very helpful. The rooms were clean and roomy. We had a 2 bedroom suite. The breakfast was one of the best I've had with a wide variety to choose from. There's a pool and a jacuzzi, a 24 hour convenience store and a fitness center. What more can you ask for?

I would stay there again.</p><br></body></html>
