<html><head><h3>Residence Inn Las Vegas South Hotel Reviews Page 24</h3></head><body><br>Worst Marriott Service Ever!!!<p>We stayed for 2 nights and you name it and it went wrong. Tried to check in late on Dec. 23rd and had to wait more than 30mins. for a Holiday Inn express employee to come over and check me in. The employee had no idea how to take my credit card and insisted that I leave it in the card the room was held with. After about 15mins the employee figured out that I wasnt about to use the card the room was held with and called someone to figure out how to use a credit card.
I had shipped 2 boxes from my home to the hotel for Christamas Eve and the hotel couldnt find them the next morning. After DHL gave all of the details one of the boxes was located with the assurance that the other box would be found. FYI - Today is May 20th and I've yet to hear from the hotel that the box was located!

Breeakfast was worse than bad! They ran out of food due to a holiday. What holiday falls from December 15th to December 23rd. Wouldnt common sense tell you to order food if there was a holiday coming up, even more so if the holiday has been on the same date for 2000+ years? I'd think that Christmas wasnt a surprise but for some people everything is a surprise.

December 25th was a real surprise. Woke up and went to see if anyone had sense enough to head to the store and buy some food......nope! Hey, it was the season of miracles!
We headed to Lake Havasu, AZ for dinner with family and upon our return we found a note under the door saying that it was Christmas and the rooms would not be serviced! It was Christmas when we left for Lake Havasu at 11:30am so I guess my above comment about Christmas being a surprise for some was accurate after all!

I tried to get towels but at 10:30pm it was apparently very confusing for the desk so I made a trip to the desk and as always nobody was anywhere to be found. I finally just walked towards the office areas and went into the laundry behind the front desk and got my own towels.
I should note that while housekeeping was not provided and they were out of food somehow a pizza delivery service was able to slip their menus under my door in my very secure locked building? Hmmmm..
I would not recommend this hotel to anyone who is used to Marriott service, or any service in general. Oh, and one more thing...Don't even try to get anything that masquerades as a manager to help you at a holiday period, the one I go was the same one who forgot to order the food.

All in all the Renaissance Suites or Courtyard Convention Center are far better places to give your hard earned money to.</p><br>Clean, Newer, Non-casino Place<p>I stayed here 02/06. I chose this place because I know that it is fairly new. The place is nice. No casino but also no smoke either. I checked in at 9 A.M. and they actually had our rooms ready. I think it was a slower time of the year for Vegas. The included breakfast is better than average. All the rooms are studios with a kitchen which is nice if you want to buy water and snacks.
The downsides: This place is OFF THE STRIP(only a few minutes by car). So you either need a car or pay taxi to get on the strip. The elevators are noisy for a place that only had two floors! Sound likes an airplane taking off from our room! Our friends said the same thing about their room. Housekeeping has to be signed up for. They leave you a card in your room to be filled out and return to the front desk for housekeeping requests. Since we only stayed two nites, I didn't filled out one of those cards. I had to call for more towels the second nites.</p><br>well worth checking out<p>family of five stayed here for 3 days beginning 4th july. thought it was really good value less than $130 per night. the room was spacious and very clea, kitchenette good and staff most helpful. only took breakfast one morning and it was fine and didn't do the socials so cant comment. shuttle bus to the strip ran every half hour but we had a car and just drove over to the strip and parked in one of the casinos and took the trolley bus. don't know if i would rush back to las vegas but if i did go back would definitely stay here again.</p><br>Nice place with 1 major problem<p>We stayed for 3 nights in July. The weather was 125 during the day and 117 at night. The room stayed nice and cool though. A few people used the pool area but it was too hot to even do that. It looked like a nice small pool with a waterfall and BBQ area right outside the gate. The hotel also has an outdoor basketball/tennis court which looks new. The rooms were very nice with a full kitchen. They also have free internet service. The hotel is located next door to a Courtyard & Fairfield Inn. We used the happy hour service at the Courtyard every night. The front desk was very helpful. The computer in the public area was being used so the desk clerk went to his computer to issue our boarding passes for our flight home. The shuttle service to the airport was very important and right on time. We also used the shuttle to the Mandalay Bay and it was right on time also. The location is right next to the freeway and was a little noisy at night. I would ask for a room in the other building. The major problem we had was with the morning breakfast. They do not have enough help to keep the food replenished. It was almost a joke. The food was very good and the assortment was great. BUT getting any of it was a major chore. When they finally would come out with food it was a major mob fight to get any before it was all gone again. People were getting very frustrated and the help was very uncaring. I would stay there again but not count on getting breakfast.</p><br>Great value!<p>Newer hotel worth the money...breakfasts were okay..our only complaint was the slow shuttle service to the strip..the room was nice and very clean..we would definitely stay here again.</p><br>Loved this hotel!<p>My husband and I stayed at this hotel Sept. 18, 2004. It was our last night in Las Vegas and when I booked this room on line, I was relieved because I wasn't finding any vacancies for that Saturday night (there was a boxing match in town, I knew nothing about). This hotel has only been open since April 2004, and it's not on any of the Las Vegas maps yet. It's a well kept secret! We were so impressed with our room. It was a queen suite. A seperate bedroom with a t.v., and a room with a sofa, chair, coffee table, large desk, t.v., kitchenette, with table, 2 chairs, microwave, cooktop, fridge, coffee maker, silverware, utensils, etc. Somebody could truly live there. It was like a small efficiency apartment! And the bed and pillows were so comfortable! Felt like feather pillows, though I'm sure they weren't. Of course, everything there is still relatively new, so it's all nice. Had a nice pool area, with gas grills, so you could even cook out if you wanted too. They also had a really nice complimentary breakfast. Usually, those aren't too good. But this one was great. They had pastries, cereal, yogurt, waffles, toast, bagels, scrambled eggs, and sausage, and juice, milk, tea, coffee. It was very good. The desk clerks were great. Very helpful, especially when we had some trouble with our reservation we booked on line. We would most definitely stay there again. There is no casino on this property, but gambling wasn't the purpose of our trip. I guess if there was any downside to this hotel, it would be that the air conditioner units are a bit noisy, and it's very close to the airport, so, you have that noise as well, but it didn't bother us at all. I highly recommend this hotel. Clean, comfortable, reasonably priced, and super nice, helpful clerks. What more could you ask for?</p><br>Great room-terrible breakfasts and socials!<p>We stayed here mid June and had a lovely time in Vegas. We had a 2 bed suite and everything was brand new. Front desk staff were helpful. However, the 'free' breakfast and 'social' foods are a joke. The queues were massive with very little left even first thing in a morning or early evening and there were not enough
tables to seat people(total 10). If you want quiet off the strip, this is for you but i would advise against if you do not have a car. The hotel operate a shuttle hourly to the Bellagio and Mandalay Bay. However, this runs only until 11pm which is not great for '24 hour' Las Vegas and although the hotel looks close to the strip, you have to walk over the freeway to get there. Hence, if you do not use the shuttle, you will need to get a cab.</p><br>La habitación cumple con los altos estándares de Marriott<p>El hotel está situado cerca del paseo de Mandalay Bay, lo suficientemente cerca de la avenida principal. La habitación cumple con los altos estándares de Marriott, al igual que el bufét de desayuno. Me encantó el servicio de transporte gratuito a Mandalay Bay. Mi recomendación es no estar en una habitación que de al aeropuerto ya que son muy ruidosas.</p><br>Muy bien ubicado. La habitación limpia, espaciosa y agradable.<p>El hotel esta muy bien ubicado, a un par de millas de The Strip. La habitación limpia, espaciosa y agradable. El personal es excelente. Nos dieron una gran suite que estaba muy bien!! Los desayunos son un poco limitados en variedad pero suficientes.</p><br>Le meilleur hôtel de notre voyage !<p>C'est un excellent hôtel !!
Les chambres sont plus que spacieuses, très très calmes. La piscine et le spa sont très agréables.
La chambre contient une cuisine, un frigo, une réserve de nourriture (enfin, du pop corn etc...) que les services de chambre remplissent chaque jour.
Le personnel est très très sympathique et très aimable.
L'hôtel est à 5 minutes du strip en voiture. Une navette est mise à votre disposition si vous souhaitez vous rendre sur le strip ou à l'aéroport.
Le parking est gratuit mais vers 23 heures, il est complet ! Vous pouvez néanmoins vous garer sur le parking des autres hôtels Mariott.
Room Tip: Allez à la piscine le matin et l'après-midi et le soir, offrez-vous une balade sur le strip.
