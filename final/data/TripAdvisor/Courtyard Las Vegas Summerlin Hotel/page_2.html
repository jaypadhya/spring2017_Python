<html><head><h3>Courtyard Las Vegas Summerlin Hotel Reviews Page 2</h3></head><body><br>good stay good location<p>Recently spent four nights at this property. Had a king bed, couch, desk, flat screen TV, coffee table, bath. Room 309 on 3rd floor. Employees were cordial, property well kept. My bed was a tad hard but it came with five pillows of various softness. TV channel selection wasn't that great, but who comes to LV to watch tv? Didn't use the pool or exercise room. Mini Starbucks in the lobby, and there was a bistro too. This means that in the morning you have to pay for even a cup of coffee...no continental breakfast here. Mini store in the lobby, had bottled water, soda, aspirin, stuff like that. Laundry room onsite- this I DID use they had HE washers and dryers. Security was good, you need a room key to get in the building or even the pool or laundry room. Good location many restaurants nearby..including McDs and gas stations too. Easy access to freeway (US-95) which takes you north to mountains and Death Valley, or south to city or Lake Mead/Hoover Dam. Room A/C worked well and reasonably quiet. Room well maintained by maids.
Room Tip: get room lose to elevator or stairwell I used stairwell a lot it was closest to where my car was par...

Green Features: They use all the latest EF practices, which doesn&amp;#39;t matter to me.</p><br>Standard Courtyard in a less than optimal location<p>Staff and room were normal. We enjoy walking in the morning but locale does not accommodate any truly safe long jaunts. Several homeless sleeping nearby, one across the street on the sidewalk; he was there everyday but one of our 4-day stay.</p><br>Love staying at Courtyard Marriott<p>I have stayed here twice and liked it a lot both times. The staff is very helpful and friendly. Its worth the price because its so nice. They have a bar, store and Starbucks. Its also located close to restaurants and Summerlin on the northwest end of town where we stay.</p><br>Great Hotel And Front Desk Staff!!!!<p>Stayed here September 2014. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Carren noticed I looked thirsty I was given a bottle of water at check in. Hotel and rooms were very clean and up to date as well as exterior. Did not use fitness center or pool so I cannot comment. Hotel had a Bistro did not dine there either so cannot comment. Would stay again and recommend to others.</p><br>Out of the way<p>This Hotel had very friendly staff and for its age was well kept. The rooms were plain and had the basics. Price was a bit high. We were booked in here due to no room in the sister hotel where the conference was at same rate. A bus came first thing in the morning to bring us to the other hotel but could not bring you back until nine thirty at night. Getting a taxi in this area of town was difficult and frustrating even with pre ordering. The public transit system goes by the front and one transfer gets you to the strip or freemont. One and a half hour trip. Good restaurants nearby.</p><br>Good hotel with pool but no free breakfast <p>This hotel is better than the La Quinta that we stay at a lot in Summerlin. But there is not a standard free breakfast and it is a bit pricey for the food here given the category of hotel. But they did put us in a room with two queen beds and a pullout couch so that was very convenient to sleep the family.

The outdoor pool and hot tub are great for the kids. There is usually someone down there until it closes at 10 pm and since many of the rooms (ours this time was 340) open to the back to the pool you can hear it. But it was not bad and since we were on a family trip it did not bother us at all. And my kids will probably be in the pool as soon as it opens in the morning. Our room also has a small deck that overlooks the pool with seating and that was a nice place to sit in the mornings and just read and eat some breakfast. The one thing here is the elevator is quite slow. We were only going up to the third floor but had to wait every time going to the room. Minor issue overall.

We booked through Orbitz. Other family used Marriott Rewards to book this same hotel on this trip and got a better rate (about twenty per cent less) and breakfast here so that is probably an option worth looking into generally, as it can save a lot of money.</p><br>Couldn't be any better!<p>We stayed for one night (wish we had stayed longer). The staff were all lovely. The room was fantastic, really big, clean, nicely decorated. The facilities were great, lovely breakfast, reasonably priced. Ample parking. Restaurants nearby. And most importantly super comfortable bed and a/c what more could you want.</p><br>Great place to stay<p>Booked a 2 queen room for one night. Upon check in was given one of their 2 queen rooms with a sleeper sofa. We had our 2 kids with us and she thought we could use the extra space. Terrific room and service. Very nice staff and clean rooms. Slightly older appearing rooms, but very satisfactory nonetheless. Very nice property. Would recommend for sure.</p><br>Good Solid Hotel Off Strip<p>Good, clean hotel off the strip. Rooms are adequately big, but not spacious like on the strip. Kids loved the free high speed wifi, which they said was faster than the Signature MGM. Check in was quick and friendly. They have a mini restaurant where you can get breakfast and dinner (but it is not free, but so what). They have 24 hour Starbucks available and a pantry/mini market at the front desk for chips or pop or things like that. The hotel is surrounded by strip malls - there's a Target and Walmart near by and tons of restaurants. It's about a 20 min drive to the strip.</p><br>Rooms are very small<p>Checked in for a softball tournament so we had lots of gear, 2 adults and out daughter. We could not get the cart into the room to unload it. The pull out bed (if that is what you want to call it) was small and uncomfortable. They did not offer free breakfast of any kind and what they did offer was poor and very expensive.
Room Tip: If you are traveling by yourself it is fine, with family and kids no way.
