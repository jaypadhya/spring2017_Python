<html><head><h3>Courtyard Las Vegas Summerlin Hotel Reviews Page 4</h3></head><body><br>Good location and wonderful service<p>We stayed here so we would be close to my father who lives in Summerlin. Great location, easy parking NO SMOKING clean rooms, good water pressure and a great breakfast was included. We will definately stay here again.</p><br>Good value <p>We booked a room for a Saturday when the strip was outrageously priced. The room was clean and bed comfortable. The lobby has a food area from 5 to 10 serving soups and sandwiches. In the morning, they have coffee and breakfast for purchase too.</p><br>Just, perfect!<p>I work at a Courtyard in Arizona. So, staying at other Courtyards I know what to look for and expect. Everyone was super friendly and cordial. Having been in the area due to a family emergency, I'm not a huge, huge fan of Las Vegas. But this hotel was exceptionally clean. I did see a couple cockroaches in the hallway in the evening, but we live in an imperfect world, I didn't think it was anything to mention to the front desk, it happens. The beds were suuuuper comfy, and the blackout curtains were just like the ones I have at home, if not better. I woke up not realizing it was 10am! he staff was super friendly, especially to my younger nephews. My family and I had two rooms, and they managed to get us fairly close to one another. I love working for this company, and being treated like a guest, not just an employee. If I'm ever in the area, I will definitely consider staying again!</p><br>Wonderful option away from the strip but not too far away<p>We stayed here as my dad lives in Summerlin and we wanted to be close. Superb service by the front desk personnel, the room was spacious and clean, very comfy bed, good water pressure. The room had a fridge and a microwave. The black out curtains made the room very dark....very nice and NO NOISE and NO SMOKE. The included breakfast was also nice...we had a good selections of eggs, meats, pancakes, bagels, juices and coffee...all cooked to order. I would and will stay here again.</p><br>Nice Place, Great Staff<p>I had the occasion to visit LV for wedding and I stayed at the Courtyard by Marriott Summerlin. The staff was super friendly and accommodating. The room was clean, the bed was comfortable and the rates are good. If I come back to this part of Las Vegas, I'd stay here again.
Room Tip: Only 8 miles from Downtown. Easy freeway access with plenty of places to eat nearby.

Green Features: I prefer to stay at environmentally-friendly hotels.</p><br>Brandi at front desk makes courtyard summerlin worth coming back<p>I came to Las Vegas for a family vacation and was greeted by Brandi at the front desk. She was very attentive and professional in helping me get situated with my room. Loved my room and even stayed an extra night because of it. I felt like I was in a 5 star hotel with the way she carried herself at the front desk. Great first impression from me and I know for sure because of her I will be back.</p><br>Excellent place to stay.<p>My husband and I stayed here August 2014 and it was excellent. Cleanest hotel I've stayed at in Vegas. The staff was very friendly and they have breakfast items in their little cafe that are reasonably priced and taste good. You don't have to walk through a smoky casino to get to your room. The King bed was very comfortable and they also provide free wi-fi. I visit Vegas often and I will stay here every time from now on.</p><br>A real pain in the toe<p>We were not thrilled with staying at this hotel since they are an all-king bed hotel, but this was the only hotel in the area close to my parents home. Since they did not offer doubles or 2 queen options we had to stay in a room much smaller than what we needed. We had 2 adults and 3 children that had to share a king bed and a pullout couch...it was rough. At check in, my thank you gift for being a Marriott Rewards member was a miniature bottle of water...just one to split between 5 people...jeez thanks.
The hotel itself is very nice with a clean and modern feel to the inside. However, it runs short on amenities. No type of complementary continental or hot breakfast was offered like many other hotels nowadays offer and this hotel was more expensive. They did have a lounge that offered a breakfast meal but if I am going to pay for breakfast, I am going to go out to a better place. The Starbucks/bar that was in the hotel was ridiculously expensive for both Starbucks drinks and for alcoholic drinks...especially when there is a Starbucks just up the street and a bar across the street. The complementary internet was terrible, it was painfully slow, if you could even get it to connect at all. The internet also did not work out in the courtyard, so you couldn't use it if you were relaxing outside or at the pool.
The pool was nice but the last two days of our stay they roped off the hot tub with caution tape with no explanation as to why it was closed. One of the nights of our stay we went out to enjoy the pool and ended up not being able to enjoy it at all. As I was attempting to open the door to the pool which you have to open with a key card...the door has about an inch and a half gap at the bottom of the door. Once I managed to get the door unlocked I stepped to the right thinking that the door would clear my toes, but I was wrong. The ground was uneven and when open there is no longer a gap, so the very sharp bottom corner of the metal door pinned my big toe between it and the ground and sliced it open. I immediately had blood going everywhere. I hobbled into the pool where my husband used a pool towel to help try to stop the bleeding. I then hobbled back into the hotel to the restroom to try to clean the wound. Once I had it almost stopped, I went to the front desk to report the injury and see if they had a first aid kit since I didn't have any band aids with us. I got an unsympathetic front desk agent who didn't care at all that I injured myself on the property and offered me two band aids. Nice.
The room itself had an odd AC system. If the door to the room was opened after you entered it, the AC would shut off. I got up early to go the fitness center while the rest of my family slept in. When I returned to the room my husband reported that apparently the AC shut off when I left the room and he woke up a half hour later in a puddle of his own sweat. So we had to monitor the AC closely if the kids were coming and going otherwise the AC was always off.
One of the days the maid did not replace any of the toiletries and we ended up running out of shampoo and conditioner.
At check out I reported all the issues and got an apology but was offered nothing for our inconvenience. My email to hotel management was met with a canned response about how my experience would help them better serve other guests. Too bad that I had to experience terrible service so that others will get good service in the future. I now have a dark scar about a half inch long on the top of my left big toe.

We will definitely not return to this hotel on our future trips to Vegas.
Room Tip: Avoid the hotel restaurant, Starbucks and lounge...go outside the hotel instead it will be much chea...
See more room tips</p><br>very pleased am returning<p>Stayed at this hotel last week end and was apprehensive as i admit i am very spoiled.
I was very much surprised. It is ultra clean,has very comfortable rooms and wonderful beds. The bed linens are first class and the rooms are super comfortable.
I found it perfectly maintained, asked for double towels the first morning and was given them automatically the rest of my stay.
It is quiet and easy in and out. It was a pleasure not to fight all the crazed tourists in strip palaces, and make to car in 2 minutes.
Lar but not least the staff could not be more cordial and helpful.
Congtatulations Mariott!</p><br>Short and sweet stayed<p>Just one night but no problems. Easy to get on and off the freeway. Quiet and clean room. Great value for a quick stay. It is nothing fancy but, we weren't looking for that. The staff was very friendly.</p><br></body></html>
