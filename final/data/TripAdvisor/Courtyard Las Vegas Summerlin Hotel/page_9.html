We loved the pool! It was good sized, clean and had plenty of towels. One complaint is that there wasn't much shade, so we were kind of all clustered together by one wall. When a little boy in our party spilled all the ice, the front desk clerk not only replaced the bag, but refilled the whole bucket. The hotel honored our request for a top floor room, and we were facing the courtyard, so there was no noise from the freeway. The fridge in the room made quite a strange noise and we would have unplugged it if we'd hadn't had food we needed to keep cold. They only have one small vanity in the bathroom area. Most of the space on the countertop is taken up with a coffee maker and mugs. There was very little space to lay out other things for doing hair and getting ready. Also, there is no fan in the bathroom, making it really humid after 3 people showering. However, the property is very clean and the staff was helpful and friendly.</p><br>Cleanest hotel!<p>We stayed just for one night, as we were traveling on to other places. This hotel is NOT on the strip for those of you who want to be where the action is. It is a few miles off of it, which was ok with us for that night. It is not a high end place, but it has to be one of the cleanest hotels I have stayed in. It has a great outdoor pool, free breakfast, and nice staff. I highly recommend this hotel for those not interested in vegas action.</p><br>Very Clean<p>Not all Courtyards are the same....But this one is a great example to keep up the standards. The staff is very friendly, the rooms are exceptionally clean, great location!</p><br>Nice Pool Nice Location Away From the Smoke and Downtown<p>Nice pool, perfect in the DRY HOT weather, laundry facility was helpful as we were on the road for several days. Staff very helpful. No breakfast but price was right</p><br>Convenient to North Las Vegas<p>The room was pretty standard Marriott, comfortable beds and clean. There are plenty of restaurants within driving distance - BBQ, Thai, Fast Food, Joe's Crab Shack. The main reason for staying here is that it is convenient to North Las Vegas, and Rainbow road.
Pleasant experience, and would stay here again.
Room Tip: Ask for a quiet room in the back.

The whole property inside and out is really nice and well-kept, and the staff is great. The rates are fairly reasonable as well. This is a very good choice for those wanting to stay in the North-Northwest Section of the Las Vegas Valley.</p><br>Nice rooms, saltwater pool, good service, no free breakfast, road noise.<p>The rooms and service at this hotel were excellent. The pool, and surrounding grounds, were very nice and well maintained. There is road noise from the freeway and it's a bit disappointing, after staying at two similar hotels in this area of Vegas, to not have a complimentary breakfast.</p><br>Nice hotel - like others have said, it's "Typical Courtyard"<p>We stayed here for 3 nights in June 2010. The hotel is nice - what you would expect from this chain for this price. In particular, the staff was uniformly courteous and helpful - when the waitress in the breakfast buffet heard we were going to the Grand Canyon she gave my kids bottled water for free - she was so sweet!

The rooms are good sized, outdoor pool/spa is ok, the exercise room is a little small, there is one coin op washer/dryer. In-room Internet is wired rather than wireless. The hotel is really close to a movie complex and a ton of restaurants - we walked to a Thai place across the street from the hotel that was very good.

Although the hotel is right off the highway, traffic noise wasn't a problem at all. It was about a 15 minute drive to the south end of the Strip. Let's face it, if you're not staying on the strip you're driving there and 15 minutes isn't bad at all. Overall this is a good place to stay if you don't mind being away from the action.</p><br>Average courtyard proerty in a nice location<p>Typical of the chain. A solid business travel hotel. Great alternative to the mega-hotels on the strip. Enjoy your stay.</p><br>OK hotel, expensive breakfast<p>This hotel is a bit oldish but well kept. Room amenities are on the low side. The price is OK, the breakfast buffet is nice but quite expensive. Internet is wired, OK for PC but not for smartphones.</p><br></body></html>
