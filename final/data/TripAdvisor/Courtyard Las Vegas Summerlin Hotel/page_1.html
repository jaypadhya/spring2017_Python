<html><head><h3>Courtyard Las Vegas Summerlin Hotel Reviews Page 1</h3></head><body><br>Got the job done<p>The hotel was a great location for where my family lives. The room was great, the check-in and check-out was expected. The pool I never visited, the morning market was perfect for getting something to eat and running out. Nothing stood out or was spectacular about the hotel but it got the job done for what was needed.</p><br>Wonderful room, would have appreciated an included breakfast.<p>Great check-in experience! Two gracious ladies greeted me with smiles and even commented on my family ring (from 1890--plenty of history there). Check-out was equally excellent, and if there had been an included breakfast (I know that nothing is free) it would have been an even better experience.
Room Tip: High-floor rooms are quiet and much preferred

Green Features: Clearly evident with notice cards on bed and in shower area</p><br>Great location for Bettye Wilson soccer or Kellog Zaher complex<p>This place is a great location if you are playing soccer or lacrosse at Bettye Wilson or Kellogg Zaher. Off the 95 and Rainbow, you are within a mile of both complexes. Restaurants and shopping close by. Being a champion is in preparations and planning. Give your player the best chance to be successful by staying close to the fields!</p><br>Close to the freeway; ok hotel<p>This Courtyard was fine and relatively well located by the freeway on the northwest side of Las Vegas. It is out of the way from downtown and major attractions but I chose it deliberately because of a commitment north of town.

The standard 3 floor pattern is seen here also with a completely redesigned interior that makes it far more inviting than the old design. I stayed one night in room 307. Though there was no microwave the room did have a frig, view of nearby homes, desk, chair, 2 queen beds, new wall paper of different colors and varieties, new carpet and flooring. The TV remote did not work and the technician quickly reset it. The a/c was set on cool and raising the temperature was not an option even though I was cold.

The 2 PCs in the lobby worked well but I could not get any jobs printed.
Room Tip: Ask the front desk for a quiet room upon check in

Lobby has a Starbucks and is very modern and tasteful. Staff gave us great recommendations for restaurant,</p><br>Nothing special<p>This is a standard Courtyard in a rather icky location. The room was spacious and clean. But the TV did not work, and the hotel could not fix the issue. The refrigerator in the room made a whining sound which kept me from sleeping, so I unplugged it. Room was expensive, including breakfast ($170). The workout room and pool are okay.</p><br>Good value, clean room, comfortable bed<p>Typical Courtyard about 15 minutes from airport and strip. Surrounded by chain restaurants. Room is nice, though the bathroom could use updating. Internet speed is fine. Breakfast not included, but available. No smoking, no casino. A great place unless you insist on a strip hotel, which are mostly twice as expensive.</p><br>relaxing getaway<p>visited family for a baby shower and our stay here was very pleasant. great customer service, we were able to check in early which was great! we reserved a double bed and the room was nice and clean. the swimming pool was great especially with the hot weather. we really enjoyed our stay and would definitely recommend it!</p><br>Expected Quality<p>Great stay for one night without the hassle of the strip. Clean and comfortable. Good service at check in and a good breakfast available. I like the free no hassle wifi and the pool area was a bonus. Would certainly stay here again. Just a 15 minute ride to the airport.
Room Tip: Ask for a room that faces the back, pool area.

I would return if I needed to; otherwise, I might try a different hotel. I’ve had better rooms for about the same price as this one. If someone needed to stay in the Summerlin/North Las Vegas area and wanted to be conveniently located near the freeway, I’d recommend this hotel. But don’t pay too much, or you’ll be disappointed.</p><br></body></html>
