The room was typical Marriott and very comfortable. Small refigerator in room, no microwave. Was close to the freeway, but I wear ear plugs and it didn't bother me.</p><br>Kudos for customer service.<p>We arrived late at night and Rita at the front desk was very helpful. She warned me that my room preference put me in proximity to the freeway. I'm an earplug kind of person and usually find my hotel neighbors more bothersome than traffic noise, but I appreciated her warning and willingness to make a change if necessary. I was very happy with my room, other than the aforementioned "neighbors," which come with the business-travel territory in Las Vegas and most everywhere else and is not a reflection on the Summerlin Courtyard. Rita was especially helpful and patient with my co-worker, who is extremely picky about his room and has sometimes contradictory requirements that can rarely be met. It takes him an extraordinary amount of time to check in to a hotel room, and Rita didn't bat an eye during the whole process. She deserves a raise for that act alone, and all of us in the customer service industry could learn many valuable lessons from her.
This Courtyard is very modern and clean. The food in their bistro is great and very reasonably priced. In addition, a wide variety of restaurants and, of course, casinos, are located very nearby.
Thanks for a great North Las Vegas experience.
Room Tip: Noise sensitive sleepers should probably avoid the freeway side of the hotel. But it's Vegas, ba...

Having just come from another Courtyard Marriott in the LA area, obviously the differences were more obvious. No fridge or microwave (they did put a fridge in my room upon request), and just coffee and no tea (I could get tee bags at the reception) and no liquid cream. Other than that, great room, comfy bed, limited TV channels.</p><br>Amazing customer service - great amenities!<p>I was in Las Vegas with my three-year old and wanted to be far away from the the Strip. This location was perfect. The new look of the Marriott Courtyard chain is beautiful and this particular location has fantastic staff. Check-in was easy and they accomodated my request for a courtyard room with a balcony. The pool area was secluded, with nice landscaping, and clean. (Too bad it was 20 degrees in Vegas and we didn't get to us it hardly!) The room was clean, spacious and nice.

My favorite part of the hotel was the Bistro. There was affordable, delicious food available morning and night. They had spacious seating in the lounge with personal televisions and my son delighted in watching cartoons while eating breakfast. Not to mention, the staff was incredibly friendly and helpful, not only at the Bistro, but also at check-in.

The location is very convenient off of 95 and there is plenty of shopping and additional restaurants nearby. I would defintely consider staying here again. Thank you Courtyard Summerlin - your staff sets the bar for hospitality!
Room Tip: Choose a courtyard-side room to avoid the noise of the highway.
See more room tips</p><br>Noisey<p>Bed was not very comfortable. Mattress cover felt paper thin. Sink backed up. Front desk forgot to provide wake up call. right on the freeway and noisey. Clean. Friendly employees. Seems liked an older property.</p><br>bang for your buck<p>We went during the New Year weekend to witness the count down fun and to show Vegas to my niece who was visiting. We had often been to the Strip and the location of the hotel was perfect for our needs as we were also looking at several properties in the Northwest. Check in was a breeze and the room was spacious and welcoming. Everything meet my expectation for a Marriott stay. My only complaint was that the complimentary coffee in the lobby was not replenished when empty, and coffee cups and creamers were likewise missing. I had to request the front desk staff to fill up supplies. Cleaning staff was fabulous! It is great to come back to a well-made room after being out all day. Pool is heated and my son just had to take a dip despite the freezing temp. Will go back again, given the chance!</p><br>Perfect for business.<p>I stayed here while attending a conference. The location is great. 24 hour Starbucks is a plus. The staff are very friendly and helpful. The rooms are clean.

With the new design that Courtyard is using geared toward more of a business model, the lobby offers a great place to work or meet with clients.

If I need to make one suggestion, the bed were unusually hard.</p><br>simply amazing<p>This hotel is so wonderful I work in the hospitality industry and this hotel is the definition of customer service I have stayed there 4 different times with 4+ future reservations already made. the staff is simply amazing as well as rooms and the location. couldn't ask for a better place to call my home away from home.
