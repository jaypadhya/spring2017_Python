<html><head><h3>Courtyard Las Vegas Summerlin Hotel Reviews Page 8</h3></head><body><br>Freshly remodeled and incredibly helpful staff<p>We stayed here overnight while passing through town - it's way north of the Strip but we've been here many times before, so it was actually refreshing to be "outside" of town. This property just (early July 2012) finished a major remodel to the new Courtyard style. It's great - new beds, linens, soft towels, and Paul Mitchell bath amenities. Free internet and free parking, too, as always.

Staff was incredibly friendly and helpful throughout our stay. They were so proud of their "new" hotel! As for location, it's right off 95, just south of Lake Mead Rd - easy off and easy on. There are numerous chain restaurants (Outback, Famous Dave's BBQ, etc.) and stores nearby. The hotel also has its new cafe in the lobby and, while we arrived too late to try it, appearances and menu looked good.

We'll be passing back through in August and I've already made my reservation to stay here again on that trip, based on this stay.</p><br>There's better out there<p>The room could have been cleaner. The back of the bathroom door had boogers on it. So gross of somebody to do that in the first place, but the back of the door was dirty in general, so I don't think it had been wiped down in a while. Half of the bathroom tile had been re-grouted, but it made the part that hadn't seem dirty and just not up to par for a Marriott property. The linens and carpets seemed fine. It's great to be away from the strip, especially with kids, but there's better stuff out there where you'd also get get a free breakfast. I'd stay there again for the price if I didn't have time to search around on the internet, but I'd probably choose something else if I could.</p><br>Convenient location Responsve Staff<p>Close to a mall with tons of restaurants, convenient to the highway. Was on business and requested a room facing the courtyard versus the street and the staff accommodated my request. Kids were in the pool at 10 pm making noise and immediately after I called the front desk, they took care of the situation and the kids quieted down and I was able to go to sleep. I also had to leave for work 15 minutes before the breakfast area opened but the staff allowed me to grab a glass of OJ and an apple to go which was very very nice of them. Excellent customer service, clean, bed was very comfortable</p><br>Clean, Comfortable &amp; Reasonably Priced<p>Although we live in town, we stayed one night to avoid a long drive home. I wasnt expecting the JW Marriot, thats not what I was paying for. I just wanted a clean, comfortable place to sleep and thats exactly what we got. There were no stains, filthy bathtubs, or dirty walls in our room. The bed was incredibly comfortable, true to Marriot standards. The free breaksfast is pretty good, but beware of their coffee. The in room coffee is much better. Overall, totally satisified.</p><br>Avoid this hotel<p>Requested adjoining rooms for family when reservaing, when checking in, told the best that they could do would be rooms across the hall from each other. With three small kids this would mean that adults would have to split up, defeating the whole point of having separate rooms for adults and kids. Given a small room for five family members instead. Two queen beds and a pull out chair. No sheets or blankets provided for the pull out and when called, told that no more pillows were available and that we would have to make due with what we have. Blankets were dirty and did not look clean. Misearable experience, but then awoke to find that car had been broken into the next morning, with side window shattered. Hotels response was "well that has not happened in awhile." Nothing done to help with the resulting situation.
Room Tip: Do not choose a room at this hotel.

Very disappointed in Marriott.<p>This property is very run down, my room was gross to say the least...dirty carpet with stains everywhere, horrible odor in room, filthy bath tub, cardboard bath towels, dirty furniture and walls. My feet were dirty from walking around the room. And to top it all off the coffee is terrible too!</p><br>Did the job<p>We needed a place to stay on the northwest side of Las Vegas, and since my parents stayed here once and like it, we thought we would try it. PBR was in town this weekend, so lots of places were asking very high prices. Courtyard did not.
The check in process was slow, but expected as only one person was on the desk, and there were five of us in line. The room was fine, what you would expect, and clean as well. The maid service was great, and overall, the experience was fine. I would recommend it to anyone for a business trip.

Breakfast was okay, but we went out after one meal there.</p><br>Friendly, clean, comfortable<p>Just right for the price. We didn't want to stay on the strip, although we did go to a show. It was a short and easy drive and the parking at the strip hotels is really nice--plenty of spots and easy to get in and out--and free, of course. The hotel staff are really friendly and caring. We would definitely stay there again.
Room Tip: Ask for a room not on the freeway or Rainbow Blvd sides.

Lots of restaurants close by. Free Wi Fi. Didn't do the breakfast. Cheaper and better at restaurants close to hotel. Nice quiet room on third floor. Can't beat it form the price and size.
Room Tip: Third floor facing side of hotel.
