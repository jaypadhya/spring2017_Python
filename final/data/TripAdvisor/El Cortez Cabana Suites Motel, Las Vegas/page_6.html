Great Decor!<p>We stayed here for Viva Las Vagas rockabilly weekender for 7 nights for only $370! Nice decor, very clean, quiet, feels like your at condo not a Vegas hotel room!!
Walking distance to all downtown bars and hotels!!! Parking is across street BUT very secure! AND actually convenient cause you don't have to walk through entire casino to get to car! Takes 2 min :-)! There is security at parking structure entrance, at Cabana Suites building and a receptionist inside!
Highly recommend!!!</p><br>1st Time at Cabana Suites<p>I like downtown Vegas and have stayed at El Cortez numerous times. 1st time at Cabana suites. 3 nights in Junior suite then 2 nights in the Super Suite. Both both good stays. Junior suite much smaller than the Super Suite. Refrigerators we nice to have. Lobby was nice. They usually have fruit and candy there for the guests. Was able to stay there extra after checking out and use the Internet until I caught the complimentary shuttle to the Airport.

View from the window was a bit disappointing. I think the only choice for beds are single queens or king. No rooms with two beds unfortuately.

Contrary to a previous review they DO have resort fees. However if you are a Club Cortez member and booked it under one of the offers you receive, mention it on checkout and they may remove the resort charges.

Liked it. Would stay again.
Room Tip: May want to be on a floor other than main.

We decided to pay extra to upgrade to the Cabana Suites this year because they looked so nice. At check in there was only one room available. We were given keys that didn't work. Thankfully there was actually someone at the front desk at the Cabana Suites (there isn't always someone there). She made us new keys and we walked into one of the worst rooms I've ever seen. There was stuff all over the carpet (hadn't been vacuumed), the top sheet on the bed was dirty and had a grainy feel to it. When I pulled back the top sheet, the sheets under it had holes in them - like holes where something had chewed through them. The room was also really dark and even with the windows open the room was dark and dingy. I called the front desk and asked to be switched to a different room. They said to come back over. The front desk supervisor admitted that we had been checked into a room that was dirty. We stayed in the tower last year so I asked if they could just put us in the tower because the "suite" had been so disgusting and dark. Nothing was done to compensate us, only a weak apology offered by the front desk supervisor. (The lady who had checked us into the dirty room was very apologetic and mortified. The front desk supervisor scolded her while I was standing there - not very professional.) So we ended up paying a lot more for a cabana suite and not given any compensation for taking a cheaper room instead. Our first night continued to get worse with our experience at the Caf√© Cortez. If their special is sweet and sour chicken, do NOT order it. It's frozen store-bought chicken nuggets soaked in sweet and sour sauce. I couldn't eat it. Our waitress didn't even bother to ask why I hadn't touched my food, just said "you want a box?" Cashier was too involved with her phone call to ask how our dinner was.

Our 2nd day here we didn't encounter any issues but due to how our check-in experience was handled I will not book at El Cortez again. I'd pay more for a better hotel next time.
Room Tip: Stay in a tower room or stay somewhere else.

Have to park in El Cortez main garage so a distance to unpack. Rooms are in building across street from main hotel and have to check in at main hotel. Have to use plastic key to get in building and room. Sometimes it worked on first try or 4-5 tries. Like having the security guard at building. Some are friendly and helpful; some not. Receptionist in lobby was always cheerful and they have workout place, free fruit, lounge area, etc. My room was on an end of 2nd floor and I found out elevator stops for 30 seconds on each floor so I quickly learned to take stairs like most did. Have to give door a strong push to open and can hear doors up and down hallway closing. The room was big. Color was a bit wild; neon green. Wish they'd had a desk and more comfortable chair. Reminded me of cruise ship because they have treats on counter that are pricey if you choose to indulge. The 2 small bottles of water free and replenished daily. Maid service was good, but she must've kept eye on soap because she didn't give me another one until one I had was almost gone. If I return to Vegas I would definitely stay here again.
Room Tip: If they haven't fixed the elevator take the stairs like everyone else. El Cortez has 2 parking...

The rooms are retro in decor with a big flat screen TV and in room fridge which are very nice to have. The beds are comfy and the bathrooms are fun with B/W tile floors and lots of glass on the shower. Love the lobby area that has lots of seating if friends stop by, and also features bright retro decor and a large flat screen TV. There is always fruit available if you feel the need to munch. Security is on duty 24/7 so I feel very safe walking across the street to the casino no matter the hour. There is a work-out area with several machines right off the lobby. This is an older building that has been refurbished so don't expect ultra- modern Strip accommodations, but if you are looking for a nice place with the downtown Vegas vibe, this is the place.
Room Tip: Rooms on the north side are larger and quieter. The south facing rooms sometimes have noise from th...
See more room tips</p><br>Great choice for Vegas on the cheap.<p>We paid $60 per night to stay here, so for the price paid, I thought we did very well.

The rooms are retro and funky, but appear to have been redone a while ago and are getting worn. Touch ups could be done to bring it back to it's original glory.

The room we had only had one window, so it was dim even during the day. So it goes. There are plenty of lamps provided for a reason evidently.

The bed was really comfortable, but the pillows were flat like pancakes and needed replacing. Sheets were clean and crisp.

The bathroom was large and very well lit. It needed a good and thorough cleaning however - there was heavy calcium build up around the outside of the glass shower stall, rust on around the drain, and good layer of dust on the tile edging and corners.

The second night we were there, the tap broke and water kept flowing with no means to turn it off. Maintenance promptly repaired it, so I was impressed.

Staff were good for the most part. Friendly and helpful. First night the on duty clerk warned us about the world's slowest elevator with a smile. She was right. We used the stairs when we came and went.

There is fruit and candy in the lobby, so if you are like me and need a sugar boost in the a.m., it's there for the taking.

Rooms had coffee makers and a small fridge, which was appreciated. A big added bonus was the free internet, which many places charge for. Also, ample free parking is available next to the hotel in their two parkades.

Security was always good, and I felt safe going from the Suites over to the El Cortez at any time of day or night. Although you have to go to the main hotel to check in, you can check out at the Cabana Suites, which is convenient.

As this is a hotel right on a downtown street in Vegas, expect some street noise. It tended to be a fairly quiet area, but we had the bad luck of being there on one of the nights that the City was doing street cleaning, so I didn't sleep particularly well that night (but by no fault of the hotel itself).
You are not sheltered in a mega complex with this hotel, so if that is your preference, this is probably not the place for you. If however you are budget minded, but still want quality and a cool little place in Vegas, I would recommend the El Cortez Cabana Suites.
Room Tip: Chose a room on the backside of the building to avoid street noise.
See more room tips</p><br>Overall great stay in fremont area<p>I had debated staying at a couple of similiar priced hotels in the Fremont area, but decided to stay here as the Cabana Suites had free wifi and no resort fees. Sadly this is no longer true as the hotel now has a facilities fee, which includes wifi. (They automaticly waived the extra charges since my reservation was made before the announce date.)

The Cabana Suites are located directly opposite the El Cortez. A security officer was always nearby to supervise the area and there was a receptionist inside the hotel.

While the suites are not huge, there is more than ample space for 1 or 2 persons. Room was well appointed with a single queen size bed, large flat screen tv, mini fridge, phone, room safe, a love seat, a chair, a settee, desk area with ottoman chair, and several tables. The spacious bath area had dual sinks, toilet, and large marble and glass walled shower. The room was very clean and everything functioned well. (The elevator is very slow.)

Staff was very friendly, although they appeared to have somewhat limited knowledge of some area attractions, etc.

Overall, a good value for the buck.</p><br>Looks Great!<p>Just got back from spending 3 nights at Cabana Suites. When we arrived we were happy with the modern decor in the lobby and our room looked ok as well. The bathroom looked great, especially the shower and the bed was comfortable. The lighting in the room is pretty dim, just a couple of lamps. The central air unit in the room worked well and kept the room at the right temperature without a lot of noise, There was a lot of noise out in the hall late on our 2nd night with some people partying in the hallway for like an hour!. The next moring while in the bathroom a roach was crawling on the wall and that was enough for me to look forward to checking out.</p><br>Great place to relax and party<p>I stayed here a few weeks ago to have a stay cation and also go out and drink and not have to worry about driving home. The stay went smoothly. When I walked in the lobby completely blew me away. We stayed in the middle suite. The room was big and exceptionally clean. Colorful and modern. I was really happy with the size and comfort of it. The rooms are in a separate building, which was weird at first, how ever, it made the rooms more quite and not many people were running around being loud. Along with that, you need a room key to get into the building and then the room, so not many people go in and out a lot.

The only things I don't like about this place was the process. When I got their valet was full, so I had to park at the "free parking" diagonally, then walk with my luggage across the street into the El Cortez, then check in, get the key, and walk again across the street to the other building and then get to the room. I only had a small duffle bag so it didn't bother me too much, but then again I was only staying for the night.

After all of this, I was very happy with my stay, quiet stay, clean and comfy room, and A LATE CHECK OUT. I will defiantly stay again. I would stay more often if there was a way to park and check in the same building. But other than that, it was still an affordable hip hotel.</p><br>Great Stay Here<p>I have stayed in the Tower Rooms previously, and they are great, but I got an offer for the Cabana Suites, and decided to give it as try. I got a Jr. Suite, which was smaller than a tower room. I was a little disappointed by this, but the other amenities made up for this. The rooms now include free wifi, which is nice. They also have a small refrigerator, a safe, and a flat screen TV. There was only 1 chair and a rolling "stool" served as a seat at the desk. The room was clean and comfortable. The tower rooms often have a smokey smell, but this Cabana Suite room did not. The sleep quality was better than most rooms I've stayed in in Vegas. The staff at the desk was always super nice, and when I checked out, they even reviewed my bill to ensure I'd been charged the correct smount. As it turns out, I was overcharged by $2, which they promptly refunded. I didn't even ask them for this, but it impressed me. I would recommend this place, and will stay here again.</p><br></body></html>
