<html><head><h3>El Cortez Cabana Suites Motel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 8</h3></head><body><br>Cabana Suites a hiden GEM downtown.<p>Heard a lot of good things about the Cabana Suites. Heading to Vegas over the 4th of July I was not finding the airfare to my liking until I checked Southwest Vacations, I got a great deal!!!

Stayed in a Junior Suite, non-smoking property which was great, free Wi-Fi, Just a great room.3 minor things I found with the room. 1 NO dresser, only shelves. 2 the wood frame that supports the comfy mattress "bit me twice". 3 NO swimming pool. These 3 thing are me being very picky. would I stay here again? Answer YES!!!!!!! Would I tell my friends to stay here? Answer YES!!!
Love the security at the Cabana Suites. Key card to get in the hotel plus a live security person 24/7.</p><br>Nice stay in downtown...<p>We visit Vegas about 2-3 times a year for shows, concerts, or shopping. We were on a tight budget this trip so we thought we would take a different approach an try downtown. El Cort was well rated on TA so I checked it out. The Cabana Suites looked pretty cool and it was a no smoking property so we booked it. Under $200 for 3 nights=score! Found parking lot easily with a security guard checking for El Cort players club member or hotel visitors. Tight parking lot, but lots of parking if you go higher. You have to check in at the main El Cort hotel, but the Cabana Suites is across Ogden. The Cabana Suites is a smaller hotel, brightly lit with art deco details in green, black, and white. We were upgraded from a junior suite to a suite on our first stay. The room was just bigger and included a sofa, refrigerator, table, and chair. The double basin bathroom had tons of space for our stuff, lots of towels, and a huge shower. The bed was nice and comfy. I slept on the sofa and it was perfect sized for an average size female. All of the staff was very friendly, you get a coupon book with a free drink, $5 in play, and $5 off a meal. We used all three of our coupons for a 2am "breakfast" which brought the grand total to $7. There were about 4 more coupons that we did not use.
One of the cold water handles on the faucet stopped working, and it was fixed in a few hours when we were gone. The only problem was that the lighting (eco friendly) was very dim. The windows are frosted and do not open so that again limits the amount of light coming into the room. 2 AC units in the Suites that worked very well.
There was a security guard outside the hotel in which you had to use your room key to get into the Cabana Suites, and the front desk is staffed 24 hours a day.</p><br>Awesome place<p>Got cancelled flight and needed 2 nights hotel. Having just stayed 4 nights on the strip I decided to check out old Vegas. Having only checked out the Fremont experience on a tour was interested in what it was like. Price was $198 total for 2 rooms for 2 nights. You check in at the El Cortez accross the street which is like a 1 min walk from the casino. The cabana suites reminded me of a south beach hotel. Retro style, lovely furniture and friendly staff. Loved the area, 1 block to Fremont st, cheap drinks and buffets, vibrant area at night which was awesome, live bands on Fremont st were cool.</p><br>Super nice rooms...<p>I stayed in an El Cortez Cabana Super Suite while in Vegas recently. I was shocked how nice the rooms were, very spacious and nicely decked out. When I first checked in at the main hotel and was told I had to walk across the street to get to my room in another building I was a little ticked at first, but it was actually nice. You're away from the casino, it was very quite and go a great nights sleep. And the whole time the casino was only 3-5 minute walk from my room. Now as for the casino in the main building, not that great. Very small, lots of smoke and ate at the diner while there and the food was so so at best. I spent most of my time when not in the room at The Golden Nugget and hanging at other hotels on Fremont street, which was only 5-6 minute walk from hotel. I booked the room on their web site and got an OUTSTANDING rate, with taxes (and no resort fees!) it was less than $50. The bed was really firm, but still slept really well. It's not to big, two people could sleep in it, but wouldn't have much room. Bathroom was really really nice, it has a large sink counter top with two sinks. Bathroom has a very large standup shower (no tub) that can easily fit two people. There is a sitting area with seating for at least 3-4 people. The room has a large desk area, a fridge and large (46" +) HD TV. If you want to stay in a really nice room and don't mind walking a little bit down Fremont to each a little better and for your entertainment these Cabana rooms were really nice. Be warned, there is no pool at the El Cortez.</p><br>Hidden Gem in Old Vegas<p>My husband and I stayed one night in a Junior Suite. We had one day in Vegas before we drove out to the Grand Canyon and he wanted to stay near Fremont Street. As we drove into the area, I was a bit skeptical as it was my first time in Las Vegas. The area around the El Cortez is in the process of being revitalized. The Cabana Suites are wonderful! The room was beautiful and bathroom was huge! I almost wish we had another night to truly appreciate everything. It is a safe and easy walk to Fremont Street and the lobby of the Cabana Suites has it own staff on hand and security was always visible.</p><br>Keeps getting better<p>Have become a semi-regular visitor to Cabana Suites, and will continue to do so. Stayed for four nights in room 6306. Now offers free wi-fi to guests, along with fresh fruit and candy in the lobby. Room was super clean and comfortable, staff always pleasant, got a fun book for reserving room directly throught their website, which gave me a prime rib dinner for $2.95 plus tax. Also free slot play. Must check in at the main building, but they are working on making it possible to check in directly at Cabanas. Love the fitness facility and used it every day.
Room Tip: Ask for rooms on 2nd floor or higher (not street level) and the side away from the street to avoid o...
See more room tips</p><br>first time in Vegas, great little place<p>This was my husband's and my first time in Las Vegas. We didn't want to stay on the Strip for our first visit--too many stories about the noise and not getting the bang for your buck. The El Cortez Cabana Suites were the ticket and mostly perfect for us. It's a short walk to Fremont Street, which is where most of the action is downtown.

As others have said, you check in at the El Cortez Hotel & Casino. Do NOT confuse this with the Cabana Suites--the hotel is a completely different building. The casino building is old, but seems to be clean, at least in the casino area. After you check in, walk across the way to the Cabana Suites. You'll need your key to get in. The receptionist at the desk is very friendly, so are the security guards (24 hour--they won't let you past without your key). The room was great--funky, psychedelic look, lime green walls and a HUGE bathroom for a hotel room. We didn't hear much--just a bit of the music from Fremont Experience, but not loud enough to keep us awake. The air conditioning was a little tricky to adjust. Really nice workout room--small, but the machinery seemed to work better than in most hotels I've been in.

Our one complaint--Internet and wifi access. Incredibly expensive for Internet use (the lobby has a public computer for short access). $11.99 per day for wifi, though I logged in without being asked for payment or some sort of identification like my room number. So I got a free day--but I'm not sure if that's typical. Big cities tend to gouge visitors with the wifi access, so I wasn't surprised.

I'd definitely stay there again, though I think I'd like to try one of the more high class hotels on the Strip too--just once!
Room Tip: If you are highly allergic to smoke, don't go here. The Cabana Suites are non-smoking, but the c...
See more room tips</p><br>If you are a strip person this isn't for you<p>First, we stayed Friday and Saturday night. Checked in about 4:30 and immediately were told we were being downgraded. We had reserved the junior suite but were randomly selected for the downgrade to the Deluxe room. Nothiing deluxe about it. My guess is because I found a rate for $42. We were told they would drop our rate but when she saw what we paid and the nightly rate she said she couldn't do anything. So she gave us $25 meal credit. Gee thanks. Was told if someone checked out they would move us. Never heard from management. If I book a certain room that's what I expect to stay in. We should have been notified ahead of time to inform us that we were getting a room the size of a dog house. Then other arrangements could have been made. Or how about comping my stay if you are putting me in a room that isn't comparable to what I booked.

Got to the room and it is the size of a cracker box. We are on the first floor. As I type this at 1 a.m. I am currently hearing the rap music from a local club on Fremont. The room has a funky smell. Kind of a mix between smoke and metal. Also, the AC sucks and the room is muggy. As for cleanliness, it's ok. I did see a drop of blood near the drain in the sink. Pretty gross.

The lobby is nice. That's the pictures you see of the couple on the website. Maybe they should show the upset couple that has been looking forward to their trip for three months crammed in a tiny room to give everyone an idea how how non-fun this place can be.

Fremont is a short walk. I like to drink as much as any Vegas traveler, and I do it well. But downtown is full of low lifes, stumbling drunks, and a bunch of people looking to make a quick buck off tourists. It's ok for a night but gets old after that. It is definitely cheaper than the strip.

The casino smells like old woman perfume. Very noticeable. Also, if you like to play BJ stay away from this place. It is a training ground for dealers. They are ridiculously slow. On average you probably play 2 hands every 5 minutes. You will also play with a bunch of people that have zero knowledge of basic strategy.

I'm 33 and this is my 8th time in Vegas, first time downtown. I won't ever stay downtown again. If you are traveling, don't skimp on the accommodations. You don't have to stay top of the line on the strip, but everywhere there is better than this place.
Room Tip: I saw the big rooms and they are nicer than mine. But again, it's 1:00 in the morning and I hear...
See more room tips</p><br>Cool Classic Vegas<p>Here for 3 nights recently, cabana suites are new and funky, formerly Ogden House Apts. Kind of old vegas meets miami south beach decor. Awesome room, clean and comfortable. good spot to recharge while experiencing vegas and fremont street 1 min walk away. 24hrs security outside, helpful friendly staff. Rooms much better than the tower across the street, M&M bowl in the lobby was a good touch. Ice on main floor only. Great value great room</p><br>Love this hotel<p>Great boutique hotel and you can find excellent deals online. Some may consider the rooms a bit small but the art deco look is fab, plus our bathroom layout was great and way huge. Front desk staff and security are extremely pleasant & helpful and the rest of the El Cortez staff at your disposal as well. Internet is not included but there's no resort fee and internet fee is cheaper than most Vegas properties' resort fees are. No big deal - take your tablet/laptop over a block to Beat coffeehouse and get some great java (or a beer!) and use their wifi.
Room Tip: Junior Suites are great but if you want to splurge try one of their Design-a-Suites: chic, cool, kit...
