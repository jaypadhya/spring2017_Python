<html><head><h3>El Cortez Cabana Suites Motel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 3</h3></head><body><br>Junior Suites are very nice<p>We just returned from our recent stay at the El Cortez Cabana Suites. We had the junior suites (H and I get separate rooms whenever possible -- it's how we stay married because our sleeping styles are so different). The rooms are nice, but I think it's weird that they don't have dressers. Like, conventional dressers with drawers. There are shelves in the credenza thing with a sliding door, but still a little odd.

My one complaint about the room was the air conditioner. I'm kind of a light sleeper, and the AC cycles on and off every eight minutes. You turn it on, and after about five minutes the compressor turns off. Then about three minutes later the fan turns off. Then about five minutes later the whole cycle starts again. After the first night of no sleep, I had maintenance come look at it and they said that's just the way it was. He suggested I get the room as cold as I want it and then just turn the fan on, which was fine since it cooled off at night (50s), but if it pulled this on/off crap all night in August when the low is in the 70s/60s, I'd be furious. This is something to keep in mind if you're a light sleeper.

The wi-fi was spotty, and the room comes with a single cup coffeemaker/coffee supplies, and two small bottles of water. The elevator is small, and twice when the door was closing, it would open again, like somebody was getting on but there was no one there. We decided it was the ghost of Bugsy Siegel.</p><br>Oasis in Fremont<p>If you look for a really nice place to stay in Downtown Vegas, this is IT! Away from the noisy Fremont Street, this hotel is just across the street from the BACKDOOR of El Cortez Hotel. It is a completely renewed property, new rooms, new lobby, new furniture and you can find really really good deals for it.
My wife and I got a Cabana Junior Suite and it was a big room. The bathroom was super clean and the staff very friendly.
They have free parking across the street from this property.
But beware, this hotel is very different from El Cortez. Don't expect the same when you cross the street.
Room Tip: Higher floors are better

The on-site receptionist was very helpful too. The Cabana Suites are located just across the road from the main El Cortez building but it's no hassle being in a seperate building. The only small complaint is that our room was not cleaned one day so we had to request new towels ourselves but otherwise everything was perfect. Resort fee is only $9 per day - very good for Las Vegas! If you're looking for a place downtown where you can actually get some sleep then you can't go wrong here!</p><br>Great option if you're staying off the strip.<p>If you're wanting a nice little spot in downtown Las Vegas, this hotel is worth a try. Located just behind the El Cortez casino and hotel tower, the building is safe with a security guard always stationed at the entrance. Even though it's tucked away, we found it quite noisy. We had a junior suite on the second floor and could really hear the street noise. We were also located near the elevator which added to the noise issue. The room was fairly clean. It wasn't pristine but it wasn't a sty. The staff were all very friendly and overall the hotel had a fun vibe. Probably wouldn't choose this hotel on our next trip, but wouldn't rule it out for a future Vegas vacation. You do get the best bang for your buck.
Room Tip: Ask for a room on one of the top floors and stay away from the elevator.

It was 2 blocks from freemont street and featured a very updated chic boutique style. Security guards manned the entrance 24/7 which was great. The room was exactly as it was pictured online. The staff was very helpful. A front desk attendant named Britt was extremely sweet and helpful. I asked if the hotel had shower caps, but sadly they did not. But she sent extra ice bucket bags to my room to use an alternative with a hand written note apologizing again. I really appreciated that! Although the hotel did not have what i wanted, her personal touch and great customer service to try to fix the problem left a lasting impression. Later on the trip she also offered to print out my boarding pass for my departure flight. GIVE HER A RAISE! My only complaint with the hotel was that it was somewhat inconvenient to check in at the main hotel building rather than at the cabana suites. I also couldnt check my bags at the "cs" after checkout but was told i would have to check them at the main hotel. Other than that, i highly recommend staying at the cabana suites. I was even given a $15 meal credit upon checkin which i wasn't expecting. A very cute hotel for the price!</p><br>Diamond in the Rough<p>Don't let location fool you-this hotel is a diamond in the rough! Modern color and style bring a fresh look to this Downtown Las Vegas, NV hotel. Everything in this room is appealing to the eye, even the furniture. Make sure you check out their beautiful spacious bathroom with his and her sinks and a shower big enough for two! Situated within walking distance to Freemont St., the El Cortez Cabana Suites is a bargain. Take advantage of all your extra money by playing the machines or tables at El Cortez, where you don't have to spend a lot of money to gamble. Gorgeous suites, hope to visit again soon!</p><br>Stunning bargain and fantastic accomodations!<p>Purchased with flight via Southwest Air package deal and was a bit skeptical after viewing reviews by other travelers. On arrival I found it to be an absolutely great deal with a very nice comfortable "Boutique" room. (I wouldn't have picked the color scheme but then I just needed a bed, TV, and shower!) Security posted at front door, must have electronic key to get in building, security in the lobby and then up the elevators toy your room. Nice comfy king bed, large screen TV, Fridge, and nice bathroom. Loved the rain forest shower head in a very nice large shower stall, no cramping here. In room coffee maker as well. Will definitely stay here on my next trip to Vegas! Only downer was that even though you pay a low "resort" fee daily for WiFi I was never able to log my laptop running Windows 7 on it. Did get my smart phone to connect to it. Lady at the reservation desk was willing to attempt log in for me but I never brought the laptop down. Was very restful as I was there for 6 nights, but on nights 5 and 6 my neighbors decided to leave their TV on all night and of course it was on the wall behind my headrest!!</p><br>Great room for price and location<p>The Cabana Jr. Suites are very comfortable and relaxing!! My wife and I enjoyed a few nights here and was amazed at how the staff were all helpful and friendly! We will be staying here again on our next visit to Vegas!!!</p><br>Wow! Who would have expected all this<p>Came to LV for a quick trip. Didn't want the hassles of the Strip

The El Cortez appealed due to location and rich history.

Reviews suggested booking the Cabana Suites and boy were they right!

Separate newer facility. While you do have to check in across the street, once you cross to the CS, it's an oasis. Small, clean, smoke free. Friendly guard outside, friendlier "concierge" inside.

Art Deco like mad. Beautiful. I booked a room on Hotels.com for $30 and upgraded my friends room for $10. While mine was smallish and his was larger, they were both immaculate and exactly what we wanted and far more than expected.

Small gym on premises. Free fruit is a nice touch.

The best part is that you're in the new epicenter of old vegas -- great restaurant and bar scene. Go to Carson Kitchen and Velveteen Rabbit for some hipster fun with zero attitude.</p><br>Worth it<p>Clean, updated look with friendly helpful staff, away from the noise and cigarette smoke of the main hotel and casino, but still within an easy walk to Freemont and The Beat Coffeehouse.
At the time they were charging $11 per device per day to access the in-room wifi which is why I've deducted 1 star; I understand that charging so little for the room they have to make money somewhere, but c'mon. Luckily, with The Beat just a block away you can get your email and plan your day for the price of a decent cup of joe.
I'd stay again.</p><br></body></html>
