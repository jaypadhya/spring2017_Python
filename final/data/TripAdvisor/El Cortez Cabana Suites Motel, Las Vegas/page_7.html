<html><head><h3>El Cortez Cabana Suites Motel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 7</h3></head><body><br>My Place In LV "no resort fees"<p>I dislike the strip and enjoy Downtown so I tried El Cortez. What really gets me is the Hotels charging a mandatory "Resort Fee", this is dishonest and typical bait and switch. El Cortez doesn't, they're honest and don't have those dishonest resort fees so I thought I'd book my stay here. The rooms are clean, cozy and comfy. Free Wifi, fruit and snacks in the lobby and right next to the covered Fremont Street experience and also only a couple blocks away from the Atomic. It's also close to the Container Park, basically great location. It also has a decent gym, nice flat screen TV and the bathrooms are very nice.

Yep, I'm staying here every time I go to LV now.</p><br>the cabanas are still one of the best stays in vegas<p>before I get into the hotel..... if you have never been to vegas it might be good to do a little research on this area as it is fairly far from the strip., i personally prefer fremont to the strip but some may not feel the same as i know allot of people who come here and i get mixed reviews, you can catch the deuce or the strip and downtown express bus to get around,,passes are $5 for 2 hours or $8 for 24 hours,, the deuce gets quite crowded you should know. If you gamble, their are allot more inexpensive options on fremont and their are allot more food choices in a smaller area.
We stayed again at the cabanas over a weekend in september and it was again one of the best times i have had at a hotel in vegas. (I come here often)
I have stayed in several vegas hotels on and off the strip, also half the ones on fremont and i can't say I have stayed in a nicer, better kept room. we had a junior suite which was a very good size and have been nicely remodeled ....all of the rooms are no smoking so the hotel is very clean
They offer fresh fruit in the mornings, had a great little gym,, . The staff was extremely helpful ,and the hotel was very secure ..... so if you are looking to get away from the big strip resorts with long lines and crowded with tourists this could be a great option for you

The hotel is located at the end of fremont st. which has allot going on, it is a bar and tavern district so it can get interesting on weekend nights, their have been a lot of police out in the area lately as the crowds were getting quite big and have been stopping for people drinking on the street which is very unlike vegas, they actually had the street fenced off for the first Fridays lately and were having people pour out drinks, they were only trying to curb a rash of underage drinkers from the first night festivities,,, if you want my opinion do not stay on fremont on the first Friday of the month, as it is the winter their is less going on now though

i definitely have to thank the daytime receptionist "Jo" at the cabanas for her excellent service as allways
when choosing a hotel in vegas I highly recommend combing all reviews on here for various hotels, not just so you know how it is but how the area is , where it is and what is going on around it as many casinos are very far away from where you want to be or think you will be. I love when people stay at the hard rock and are mad it is not "just off strip" like it says as it is very far away

Also with the non smokers (I am one as well) every hotel in vegas is smokey, the casinos and restaurants, most of the rooms and hallways.. your cloths will be drenched in smoke by the time you get back to your room so if you come here hoping for a real non smoking room I wish you the best of luck, if you stay at an older casino all the rooms were likely smoking for 30 years and with the casino below I have no idea what you were thinking. I just see so many complaints on here about this subject that I had to put this out their, if you have never been here before ,,all the smoking is bad and if this bothers you stay away as you will not escape it.

and do not forget to grab a vegas magazine like 24/7 or vegas weekly as they always have coupons to do things.</p><br>Right up there with worst experience...one nightmare after another<p>We arrived at the hotel only to find Valet parking backed up. We were finally able to get our $60,000 truck off of the road. The guy doing valet was not polite...........we finally got our bags out of the truck, only to discover no bellman in sight. I went inside, while leaving my husband outside with our bags, to get us registered. I told the gal that registered us that we needed a bellman. She went out with me after registering only to discover the bellman helping someone else that had arrived after us. FYI....only one bellman on duty. We picked up our own bags because we are freezing (it's 38 degrees) and head for our room only to discover our key cards do not work in the elevator. I return to the desk, get another set of cards, only to discover they don't work either. By then I am so aggravated moving our bags in and out of the elevator....I return back to the desk. The gal then tells me we are in the wrong elevator and we have to go outside and cross the street to get to another building (are you kidding me!!!!) She goes and gets the bellman's cart, and we take our luggage across the street and announces she can't take our bags up to our room because she has to get the bellman's cart back to him.......
We had a junior suite. It should be illegal to attach the name "suite" to it. It is a small regular hotel room with a refrigerator.
As far as the casino goes........"SCARY" Homeless people everywhere!. We were even approached by a guy trying to sell use drugs.
We ate at the café twice.......it was very apparent by the taste that they did not clean their grill or pans, whatever they use to cook eggs. We met some friends at the café a couple of days after we were their for dinner. I had a drink (and so did my friend) that we carried in. As we were waiting on our meal, the gal seating people came over and pretty much announced to the entire restaurant that they don't allow outside drinks...to me. She then picked up my drink (which was a plane soda) and said you can pick it up on your way out.....leaving my friends drink, which was an alcoholic drink. The day we arrived, I had white athletic socks on. After removing my shoes and walking to the bathroom twice that evening, my socks were, to say the least, dirty.
Don't go their. You will regret it
Room Tip: don't do it at all.....
See more room tips</p><br>Nice like being sent back in time! :)<p>We booked these during a major trade show in Vegas when other rooms like Excalibur were over $200 a night. We thought this might be a seedy scary place but were pleasantly surprised. It is a building across the street from the casino but safe to get to. Security guard 24 hours a day and you have to use your room key to even access the lobby. The color were stunning and awesome. The lobby was done in black and white with vintage furniture. The room was a bright green with black and white and also vintage new old furniture. We loved it!!! The bathroom was roomy and the shower was a corner shower. Only one problem was the shower water knob stuck out a bit to far and we each bumped it more than once each shower and that was a little painful. But nothing major at all! Highly recommend!! We will be staying there again. The room was under 100 a night.</p><br>Las Vegas on a budget<p>There are many things I really liked about the El Cortez Cabana Suites, and I would certainly stay in them again. We had a junior suite, which was big, although probably the same size as a normal hotel room but the bathroom was quite a bit larger than a normal hotel room. The staff at the customer service desk both in the main hotel and the suites were very helpful and friendly. The property was clean and seemed well maintained. And the best part for us was that it's completely non-smoking! That being said there were a few nitpicky things: the neon from the lights on the side of the hotel could be seen in our room and I found it distracting to try and fall asleep. There are no curtains on the windows, just plastic white shutters so it certainly let's a lot of light in when the sun comes up and the neon lights can be seen all night. The doors are heavy and they do slam loudly - perhaps the hotel should consider posting signs about closing them slowly or helping them close - it does make a difference. There is 24 hour security, which is nice, but if you are having trouble getting into the main door of the suites (which happened often to us) they will not help you get in. The biggest issue I had was the lack of housekeeping for our room. The first day was fine, the second day they came and only did the bathroom, the third day no one came at all. This was frustrating as we had a lot of garbage that didn't get emptied and had run out of kleenex and came close to having no toilet paper. And, we could not figure out how to work the air conditioner. It seemed really easy but the fan would only run as per the air cycle so the room tended to heat up quickly. If you just wanted the fan to run all the time you had to turn off the air. It would be nice if the two could be combined. But, again, that's nitpicky.

The room is BRIGHT green and it feels a little like being in Wonderland. The bathroom is nice and modern, although the vanity doesn't reach to the wall and I often dropped things down the side and had to get my husband to come and reach them out.

The beds are on the harder side and the pillows on the flimsy side, but the sleep was fairly decent (once we figured out how to block some of the light from entering the room). The best part is that, aside from the doors, it is SO quiet. We really didn't know others were staying there unless we saw them in the lobby or elevator.

I enjoyed my stay here. The area is totally safe to walk in - we never had any trouble, even at 3 a.m. There are some perks to staying at the hotel with free play, coupons for the restaurants, match play, etc. We would definitely not hesitate in staying here again.

Note: there is no pool. But, there is a free shuttle that will take you upon checkout to the airport!
Room Tip: See if you can get a room on the side of the hotel without the neon lights.
See more room tips</p><br>back in time<p>We saw a special on this hotel on TV and thought we'd try it for a little old Las Vegas experience. The Cabana suites are recently remodeled. Security was excellent and staff helpful and friendly. Our only complaint was A/C. The unit is under the window as most hotels, but the bed is too close. The circulatioh pattern didn't allow the unit to cycle on and off. As a result, It got really cold on one side of the bed. The casino was pretty smokey, but whatever they tried to combat it made it even worse. The location is convenient to Freemont Street and the older established part of Las Vegas; the part we went to experience this trip.
Room Tip: we opted for Jr. Suite which was same or smaller than average chain hotel room.
See more room tips</p><br>Enjoyed the experience<p>I enjoyed staying in the Cabana suite , I think it was a jnr. Suite, but my husband thought it was too small and not as good value as Main Street Station where we had stayed earlier. The bathroom is nearly as big as the main room, it is very modern and lovely to use. The room was quite dim and we only had one window so couldn't make it any lighter. I probably wouldn't,t stay again but was glad that I had as I wanted to see what they were like. it was a lot quicker getting out of your room in comparison to other larger hotels. It also felt very safe and has a security person outside the building 24 hours.</p><br>Cabana Suites<p>We stayed in the cabana suites just this last weekend. The decor is adorable! All the staff were wonderful, very nice, very friendly.

The rooms are a little dark, a little on the small side, but the beds are comfortable and the rooms were clean.

The cortez cafe had a FABULOUS breakfast, cheaper than Denny's and the staff was great! The casino does have a musty smell to it though.

The parking garage is kind of a tight fit for bigger vehicles. I would stay here again!!</p><br>Old Vegas at it's best<p>I was concerned about staying at the El Cortez because I thought that the very reasonable prices might mean we would be in a lean and mean place. NOT SO! I would echo the previous reviewers and say the Cabana suites hotel was a good place to stay if you want to be near Freemont St.. I was surprised at how quiet it was and how easily I slept. I felt sorry for the security guys standing out there in the sun for 8 hours at a time, but yes, security was excellent. Soft corners on the bed frames would be a smart addition. Some of my family were staying in the Tower where the rooms were large and comfortable. The service all round was friendly and very helpful. This is a hotel I would gladly recommend. (The Triple George Grill a couple of blocks away was an added plus!)</p><br>Great Deal!<p>My husband and I stayed here from Sept. 20-22, '13. We originally were planning to stay at the Golden Nugget but the price didn't suit our budget. We booked on Hotwire and got the El Cortez for $44/night.
I was a little nervous after reading the reviews about the area and proximity of the hotel to Fremont St. It's a very short walk which can be done through the El Cortez Casino, and a few blocks up and you are where the action is, if that's what you are looking for. On the walk you will find a bunch of cool restaurants and bars in an area called Fremont East. As for safety, there is a security guard at the Cabana Suites door most if not all of the time. The door is card entry and there is an attendant at the desk of the building. I felt safe coming back to the hotel from 11-1am.
As for the hotel, it's old Vegas. Lots of folks who have been coming to Vegas for 40 years or so and just want to gamble, drink, and eat without spending a lot of money. Check-in was quick, we upgraded for $20 extra/night to the Cabana Suites. We received a "Fun Book" which gives you coupons to use in the casino. We ate at the cafe twice and used a $5 coupon each time. The food is decent and the service is friendly.
The room we stayed in was good. Free wi-fi, comfy bed, kohler fixtures in the bathroom. I was taken aback by the lime green walls, but you get used to it after a few hours.
The only downside was that the property doesn't have a pool, but for $20 bucks a day you can get a chair at the Golden Nugget.
I would stay here again if the price is right. Nice stay all around.</p><br></body></html>
