<html><head><h3>Meridian Luxury Suites Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 5</h3></head><body><br>Beautiful Accommodations!<p>We spent 2 nights at this beautiful non-gaming hotel that has been converted from condo units into suites. We had booked a studio suite special of $99.

We arrived earlier than expected and our room was not ready and we were told to come back to the desk in a half hour, but in the meantime we were welcome to visit the pool area. I returned in the time allotted and we were assigned a quiet lower level room per my request. What a surprise when we entered - we were upgraded to a one-bedroom for the same $99! Marble floors, awesome kitchen (even though we did not cook), king size bed, washer/dryer - which enabled us to do all our laundry at the end of a 11 day vacation.

This hotel is very secure with gated entry & gated parking garage; beautiful pool area with flowers, palm trees, & plenty of shaded seating if that is your desire.

An easy walk to the craziness of Vegas - which we have visited many times, but Vegas itself turned us off this time and I don't expect we will ever return. Very high restaurant prices and you could not walk down the strip without being harassed by timeshare hawkers who would not leave you alone. We are not gamblers, but did notice that the casinos were quiet and news reporting some layoffs. Vegas has certainly changed, and not for the better.

We did find reasonable prices in the cafe located directly across the street at the Tuscany Suites & Casino, but stay away from meals on the strip! We bought a hot dog with fries & a drink at Ceasars,sharing it at lunch and it came to over $12.50 and wasn't all that good!

Also, if you are looking for a fun dining experience check out the Bahama Breeze located a short walk from the Meridian going east on Flamingo. There are a number of restaurants, but this one took our eye. Great food & fun, try the fruit flavored mojitos!</p><br>fantastic meridian room 7-231<p>the dogs nuts for $99 per night 11th - 15th of april for an studio apartment can not moan the apartment had everything cable for the english footy, dish washer, microwave,washing machine and dryer and every piece of cutlery and kitchen utensil you can think of.clean pool and the front desk was fantastic with everything i asked for early checkin 10am no sweat could'nt do enought a 15 minute walk to strip and ellis island across the street for food $3.99 breakfast special 10* sirlon with 2 eggs,sauteed potatoes and 2 toast just one off the great deals they do.will be back soon</p><br>Great room... not much else<p>I was coming to Vegas to attend NAB for a few days, then my wife and 11 month old daughter were to join me for a little mini vacation. I picked the Meridian because a.) the price I found on Travelzoo, b.) the reviews I had read online, and c.) the fact that it had a kitchen, which was important to me because of my daughter.

Overall, I thought the Meridian was nice, although I encountered some significant issues with the hotel that would most likely keep me from staying there again.

The Pluses: The rooms are very nice. It's obvious they had been remodeled recently. The marble floors, the granite counters, the stainless steel appliances, the 2 lcd TV's were great. The 1 bedroom suite that I got was clean, tidy, and spacious.

The room had a nice leather sofa and chair, the kitchen was stocked with plates, glasses, silverware, cooking utensils, and a coffee maker. The washer/dryer was a fantastic convenience, as I was able to to laundry whenever I needed.

The Minuses: My first complaint is the location. It's not so much where it is, but the fact that it's hard to get anywhere from the hotel. While attending NAB, I walked to the Flamingo each morning to take the monorail to the convention center. This walk is not trivial, as you have to pass under the monorail, go into the Flamingo, then walk BACK on the walkway to the station. From hotel room to monorail platform is a minimum of 12 minutes. Now, you do this twice a day, walk all around a convention center, and you have sore feet by the end of day 3.

Also, there is NO grocery store within walking distance. One day I stopped at one of the gas stations/quickie marts on the way and could only find a handful of provisions that I would eat. Further down on Flamingo there is an Albertson's, but you would have to drive to get there. My wife and I took a cab one night to the CVS next door to get a prescription and it cost $20....

Speaking of cabs, it seems difficult to get one at the Meridian. Sunday morning my wife and I had a 7:10am flight out of McCarran. We called the front desk at 5am to get a cab. They said it would take 5 to 10 minutes. By the time we walked to the front gate 10 mins later.... no cab. I went to the front desk to check, and they said they would call again. 10 mins later... no cab. Needless to say, I was getting perturbed. At 5:35am I finally went to the street and hailed one driving by. Ridiculous.......

If the hotel is reading this, I would strongly suggest having a shuttle that runs at the very least to the strip every half hour or so. That would make life SO much easier for guests. Also, work out the cab issue. Any other hotel on the strip has a queue of taxi's waiting at a moment's notice......

Another thing I wasn't crazy about was the housekeeping service. 2 days in row we had no service. One of the days we called the front desk and they did come to clean our room while we were at dinner.... the next night we came back from a long day out and nothing had been touched. It was frustrating to come back to a dirty room with a pile of dirty towels and sheets..... that reminds me..... I'm not sure they change the bedsheets. One day my daughter spilled something on the sheets.... after housekeeping came, we noticed they had just made the bed back up, stains and all.

My next issue is internet service. Although they have cable modems in each room, I could NOT get it to work. I have worked in IT for 12 years now, so I think I can troubleshoot something as simple as a network connection. For reference, my father, who stayed down the hall from us, could not get his to work either. The only internet available was in the business center (you have to pay to use the computer) or WiFi by the pool. So, I basically had to walk down the pool every morning to check my email. Ok, I know it's not torture or anything, but it sure would have been nice to be able to do that from my room.....

Speaking of the pool, I will say that it is pretty nice. The pool is in good condition, lots of chairs and tables... even grills that you could use for a poolside cookout. My complaint is that many/most of the chair cushions are badly stained, have cigarette burns in them, or both.

I have stayed at several places in Vegas.... the Palms, the Venetian, the Bellagio, the Hyatt at Lake Las Vegas (Now Loew's) and the Ritz Carlton. That being said, I think the room at the Meridian ranked right in the mix with quality of those other hotels, with the added perks of the kitchen and washer/dryer. What the hotel is really lacking is the service those other hotels provide. If you want to get people to come to your hotel, you MUST focus on that....

In conclusion.... while I got a great rate on my room, I go to Vegas for the experience. I will pay more in the future for a better location and better customer service. For me it's worth it to add a few hundred dollars to my vacation to have someone say, "Welcome back, Mr. Martin" when I walk back into my hotel. For that reason, I will most likely not stay at the Meridian again.</p><br>what a pleasant surprise!!!<p>i must say that this hotel was alot better than i thought it would be. i received a promotion rate email from hotwire.com about the meridan. i was going to las vegas, on business and it was a last minute trip.(by the way, this hotel always have some kind or promotional discount rate. just call them directly and they will hook up you up).

it is an all suite hotel and gated. the thing is they have a few actual residents that live in a few of the suites. there vision is for half the resort to be occupied by residents and the other half the hotel. they offer studio, 1, and 2 bedroom suites. they also have a 2bdrm w/den, but i didnt look at that one. the rooms are beautifully decorated w/leather furniture, california king-sized beds, full kitchens w/stainless steel appl, and every room has a balcony. they offer free wi-fi and the cable provider is cox communications. this hotel has 2 swimming pools, full fitness center(24hr), raquetball court, bball court, and a dry sauna. the pics of the website look exact like the rooms. you know how you look at pics of the rooms and it looks like they take pics of every angle of their suites, then make it seem like all the rooms look like those pics? not the case here.

the only knocks i have on the hotel are as follows: at the time that i arrived, there wasnt a bellmen on staff. so i had to carry all of my bags myself and there was alot of walking and stairs. the hotel is separated by building(1-7). once you get inside the gate of your building, its fine because you can take an elevator to get to you room. also, you cant order movies. this isnt your typical hotel where you can press a button and order a movie. lastly(i dont see this as a knock, but others might), the hotel is located a couple blocks off the strip. there is a walk involved. the good thing is when you get to the corner of flamingo and las vegas blvd, you bump right into casears palace and ballys.

overall, this place this freakin great. i would certainly recommend this apartment style living hotel to anyone. i hope this helps. again, dont forget to call about promotional discount rates. regular price, the hotel can be on the expensive side. the discount rates are well worth it.</p><br>Nice facility - Unimpressive service<p>I recently had a very unimpressive and disappointing stay at the Meridian Las Vegas.

First of all, I booked my room several weeks in advance on the hotel website, presumably maintained by Warwick International Hotels. On the booking engine, I was able to mark a box notifying the hotel that I needed a baby "crib" for the room. I marked the box for the crib and booked the room without a problem. No other information in that regard was requested.

When I checked in, however, not only was I informed that my crib request had not been noted by the staff (even though the clerk acknowledged it was on the computer reservation system), but also that there was a service charge of $35 for the first day and $25 for each additional day because an outside contractor had to come in and "build it" in the room.

I was not so much bothered by the price (because I got a good room rate when I booked the room) but by the fact that I was not notified of the additional charge prior to my stay. I have stayed in many hotels and, in my experience, there is never an extra charge for a baby crib. Never once has a hotel charged me for a crib.

What really bothered me was that I was treated extremely rudely by the "concierge", a middle-aged lady stationed next to the check-in counter. The clerk who checked me in was very apologetic and polite, but the concierge was flat inconsiderate and even hostile.

When I indicated my surprise at the extra charge, the concierge, who was obviously overwhelmed at the time with performing work for other guests, said, "Did you not see the pricing chart for the crib?" I said, "No, it was not on the website. I just checked the box for the crib." She then grilled me on the website I used, informed me that "every hotel" charges extra for a crib, and proceeded to hand me a two-page, legal contract with some outside vendor that I had to read and sign to acquire a crib for my child. When I said most hotels do not charge for a crib, she asked me "Which hotels? Where have you stayed where they don't charge for a crib?" I responded, "Marriott, Hampton Inn, MGM Signature, Green Valley Ranch, and every other hotel I have stayed in with a child."

I was just flabbergasted that a hotel employee would debate a guest in front of a crowd of other guests checking in on such a simple mix-up. The appropriate response would have been to apologize and compensate me for at least half or part the crib charge (which is apparently going to be billed to me by an outside source). I would have accepted a reasonable explanation and response but the concierge's belligerence is unacceptable. Mercifully, the crib was "built" in our room by approximately 9:00 that night. I never heard from the concierge again.

Following this debacle, I will note that our one bedroom suite was lovely for the most part. The accommodations are nice. However, during our stay, our kitchen sink collapsed the day before we checked out. We had filled our sink with water to clean out some of our baby's bottles and to give our infant child a bath and, all of a sudden, the whole sink collapsed into the cabinet and onto the base of the cabinet. (I propped the sink up with a roll of paper towels for the remainder of the stay.) Thankfully, no one was injured. (Had our baby been seated in the sink, taking a bath, for instance, when the sink collapsed, who knows what would have happened.) The sink apparently became unglued.

We called maintenance, who arrived promptly. Two gentlemen arrived and one said, "Oh man, not again!" He indicated that the same thing occurred in another unit within a couple of days prior. All kidding aside, let me assure you that this could have been a plaintiffs' attorney's dream case. The maintenance staff offered to move us to another room, but, by that time, it was more of an inconvenience to move than endure a lack of a kitchen sink since we were checking out the next morning.

Finally, I stood in line holding onto my child for at least twenty minutes the following morning trying to check out of my room. The line went out the door of the lobby. Not only did the hotel clerk upon check out fail to apologize for the delay but he also even failed to ask how my stay at the hotel was. Yet another staffing snafu.

On the whole, the facility has potential. The suites are nicely furnished and spacious. The staffing issues are not to par, however. I have stayed at many hotels, and it is this humble traveler's opinion that this hotel would have difficulty achieving even a AAA three diamond certification. Sorry, but it is not even close.</p><br>Luxurious and Hidden<p>This property is a luxury resort with the convenience of condo living. This does not feel like a hotel at all. More like an upscale condo resort with gated manned security, underground parking, fully furnished suites (with everything you could ask for), and an absolutely lovely tropical pool/spa area. The security guard at the gate was wearing a tux and white gloves when we arrived. The check-in area is a small office and very personal service is given ( not the lines like in the big casinos). The suites are very large with tall ceilings. We stayed in the two bedroom unit which had a washer and dryer in it. Stainless steel appliances, leather sofas, upscale bedroom furnishings, granite, private entrance, private deck, two bathrooms, elegant chandelier, large plasma TV, and more. I have stayed at almost every large Casino on the Strip and although this property is one block off, it is the ONLY place I will stay in future.</p><br>Beware!<p>First suite was trashed. There was a tar-like sticky substance in quite a few spots on the kitchen floor. The window blinds were broken; one set was open on a long narrow window next to the front door, and I had to close them manually for safety purposes. The window curtains as well as the shower curtain were pulled off the hooks. The living room area rug was filthy--many patches of ground-in dirt. The living room leather furniture had something sticky dried on it. And the one that I found most unacceptable: One of the bathroom toilet seats was cracked in half. They moved me to a place that was intact. The first night was no charge, but I had to make the suggestion myself. The buildings are set up like catacombs with many nooks and crannies and walls; therefore, it's not a place for anyone traveling alone. I was extremely uncomfortable going back to my room at night.</p><br>Loved the Meridian, a must stay!<p>We stayed at the Meridian for three nights in a one bedroom suite at a great price of $129/nt. from a Hotwire Travel Zoo offer that booked directly with the hotel. I thought I should write this review as I am extremely picky about accommodations. This is a large complex so request rooms close to what you want entrances ,pools etc. and you will enjoy your stay more.
You really can't beat the price for Vegas for what you get. We had considered the larger strip hotels but where so thankful we chose the Meridian instead. The larger hotels were extremely crowded, and noisy and it takes forever to get to their pools ,or your room, or through the casinos, due to their size.
We took a limo from the airport because the taxi lines are so long, The concierge Debbie did a great job. You can send her a customized grocery list prior to your arrival for a minimal fee., $10.00 and your kitchen will be stocked prior to your arrival. Check out their online concierge service , it was well worth it .
The hotel provides coffee, laundry and bath amenities.
Our condo location was perfect, right next to the pool. with balcony overlooking it . The room was very clean ( not immaculate). Furnishings were top of the line -kitchen appliances sub zero fridge, viking/wolf gas stove ,bedding high quality linen, bath travertine and granite and toilet self flushing and heated, plasma TV's in both rooms, nice leather furniture and teak dining table. Walk in closet. Washer and dryer. Nice carpet and paint. No problem with the drapes/sunlight. Daily maid service. Our room must had been recently updated. Please note the plumbing was just the reverse of normal hot for cold and cold for hot in both the kitchen sink and the tub.
The Meridian has 2 pools -the one near the club house is the nicer.
Perfect location! It is only a 7-8 min walk to the monorail stations at either Ballys or the Flamingo and just a few more minutes to the strip to Caesars and Bellagio.. A cab is not needed; Liquor store on the same street as you walk towards the strip. Ellis Island within one block- $6.99 steak special. . Other restaurants Lawrys and Bahama Breeze within 2 blocks or 10 min walk. We would recommend eating at Marrekech if you like Morrocan and belly dancing-but take a cab.
No concern about safety as the community is gated with security guards and entrance cards required. If you have guests arriving just notify the front desk. Nice grounds and very quiet.. We took a cab back to the airport. the front desk can get you one. It arrived within 3 min and we were at the airport in 10 min -$12.50. We would definitely stay at the Meridian again. Nice for couples and families, but not students on spring break.</p><br>We were delighted.<p>I found the Meridian via Travelzoo and booked a one bedroom for five nights for my husband and myself at $129/night. Having stayed on the strip on previous trips to Las Vegas, I had a few concerns with being off the beaten path but upon our arrival we were thrilled with our decision. Because of an early morning flight into Las Vegas, we arrived at the Meridan at 11am thinking we would have to wait to check in but were informed that our "room" was ready and that we were upgraded to a 2br unit. Although we never used the second bedroom, we were delighted to have so much room. The second bathroom certainly came in handy. The gal who brought us to our unit infomed us that the complex had been built 12 years ago as residential condos and within the past 2 years had gone through updating of each unit to convert them to rental units. Our unit looked pretty much like the photos on line, what you see is what you get.

Other reviews mentioned issues with cleanliness and I cannot say it was a problem for us. Keep in mind these units were built 12 years ago so not all is brand new and the furnishings are not top of the line quality and there were a few chips in the paint where suitcases most likely were the culprit. If your the type that wants nothing less than 5 star you may not be totally satisfied but overall I think it might be one of the best values in town. We had very little interaction with the front desk, only at check in and check out. The work out facility was above average. The pool area was a relaxing retreat from the business of the city. We sort of felt like this was two vacations in one.

I was hoping to make better use of the kitchen but there is no supermarket in the area. Just several small gas station/mini markets in the area where we picked up a few items. If you have room in your luggage, pack a few food items, you'll be glad you did.

The walk to the strip was not a big issue, stop at Bill's when you get to the strip for a 98cent margarita!

I will say it again, overall we were delighted with our stay at the Meridian. At $129 per night it was great. We'll definitely be back. Hope you enjoy your stay as much as we did.</p><br>Great Value and great place for families. . .with minor issues<p>We found a special for this place via travelzoo. The price was great for a 2 bed/2 bath. And the condo was even nicer. Very well equiped and furnished. Fully equiped kitchen. TV in each room.

The only issue is the floors are a bit dirty. It's as if they didn't mop for a few weeks. This is the only thing that kept me from giving it a 5 star rating.

If you want a place on the strip. . .this would not be the place, but if want a great place that is only about a 10min walk from the strip, this would be it.</p><br></body></html>
