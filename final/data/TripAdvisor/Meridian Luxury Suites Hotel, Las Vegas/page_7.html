<html><head><h3>Meridian Luxury Suites Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 7</h3></head><body><br>Fifth time in Vegas, best time in Vegas thanks to the Meridian<p>Not sure what types of hotels the people who gave this place a bad review usually stay in, but as a frequent traveller all over the world, I would have to say this was one of the best hotel experiences I have ever had. We got an incredible rate thanks to the weekly Travelzoo Top 20 email earlier in the month, which beat anything the strip could have offered us for the same time period. Let's see...daily service, which isn't always the case in similar apartment hotel chains, FREE in-room internet (I challenge any hotel on the strip to match that), flat-screen tv, secure parking and grounds, fully equipped kitchen that helped us save on over-priced bad breakfasts, even a washer and dryer. Only beef was getting a Queen-sized bed instead of a King. We went with the studio suite, which was more than enough room for 2 people, and at $99/night...come on, what can you possibly find to complain about? Some reviewers have said this is the best kept secret in Vegas, and it's only a matter of time before word gets out. Maybe that's the reason for the poor reviews, to try to deter people from finding out about it? I hope when we go back in another year or two we can still get this same sort of deal, but I have a feeling we'll be out of luck.</p><br>discusting filthy place<p>We spent New Year's at the Meridian, paying almost 600.00 a night for 2 nights in a Valancia suite. We booked in August so this was not a last minute booking. We were given a lesser accomodation, unbeknownst to us until we got to our room after lugging all our luggage through the confusing maise of hallways. When we returned to the front desk to get the room we paid for, they were very sceptical and said I had not booked the Valencia suite. I had to show them all my confirmation emails from them, they relented and apologised, but the suite was dirty and had to be cleaned.We waited over an hour for the bellman to help us relocate our luggage, he didn't show so we moved it ourselves from one building to another.The Valentia suite, while nicely decorated was very dirty. The tile floors had smeared stuff all over them from the previous guests, even in the toilet area. It was really gross. Don't take your shoes off in that place. The pull out chesterfield had the previous guests sheets still on them and there was still garbage in the containers. The shower enclosures were ancient, unlike the rest of the place, it was wierd.There was a smell of mold and carpet deodoriser coming from the carpet in the master bedroom, it made me sick that night, and a week later I'm still sick. My daughter had an allergic reaction and is still sick. Since it was the day before New Year's eve we couldn't find another accommodation. There is something not quite right about this place, the window dressing is there, but there is no service. We said it was like a Super 8 Resort . Don't bother staying here unless you bring copious amounts of your own cleaning supplies and don't stay here if you have allergies.</p><br>WHAT A HOTEL-never stay in a regular LV hotel again<p>Great Decor- 2 bedroom- 2 bath- master closet- kitchen with all major appliances and necessities- living room -dining room balconry. It was like Pier one or Restoration Hardware exploded- flat screens in bedrooms and living room. 2 pools-nice because there wasnt a million people- very private- nice for us 40 somethings! It is 2 long city blocks down from the Flamingo. It was great because what we spent on the room we saved huge relaxing with friends for wine and food- that we had in the large living room-we saved so much snacking and drinking at our 2nd home! We still went out but it was great having EVERYTHING we needed right there! Very nice</p><br>Wow!<p>WOW! My girlfriend and I just returned from a week in Las Vegas. We reserved a two bedroom suite at The Meridian Luxury Suites and the place was so large we invited our friends from LA to drive up and spend the week with us. We each had private bedrooms with their own baths! The staffed did our grocery shopping for us so we always had snacks and beverages when hanging out together in the living room, kitchen or balcony. Too bad I dont cook- the kitchen was amazing!
All this and a 4 minute walk to the strip! I cant wait to return.</p><br>Pleasantly surprised!<p>My family of 5 recently stayed for 2 nights in a 2 bedroom suite. I had my doubts after reading some of the reviews, but everything was wonderful! Check in was quick and they even met us in the parking garage and helped us find the unit. The place is large and a little confusing to find our way around, but they were very helpful.

The unit was goreous and had everything we could have needed except the food. It was professionally decorated and we had beautiful blackout curtains. The beds were amazingly comfortable. 3 tvs, fully stocked kitchen, washer/dryer.

The pool and workout areas were fabulous! The weather was warm and we spent our mornings lounging in the comfortable chairs and playing basketball and swimming in the 80 degree pools/hot tubs. It is like a caribbean resort with the palm trees.

This place suited us well. It gave us the space we needed, it was clean, everyone was friendly, and it was secure. We were there for a family vacation with the kids so a casino environment was not what we were after. Plus, it was close enough to walk and you end up at the center at the Bellagio. You are also near the monorail.

So if you are into a relaxing, upscale, spacious place to stay without the gaming, and are up to a short walk- this is your place.</p><br>Undiscovered Gem!<p>I cannot believe this hidden treasure that is just a short stroll away from the strip! Before arriving I was extremely hesitant as I knew nothing about this new resort. I saw the pictures online, but as we all know this is no guarantee that is what you get upon arriving. Let me tell you, it was better than advertised! The rooms are spacious, the finishes are exquisite and the furnishings are first class. The front desk was helpful, the security is friendly and the atmosphere was very laid back. I honestly wondered rather or not I should do such a positive review as I want to keep this place a secret only to myself! The only drawback I would say is there is no food on site. They do have an "in room" dining menu which is delivered to your door, but not quite the same as room service. I was told by the front desk that this feature is coming in the near future.

Needless to say I will be coming back again and again to this undiscovered gem in the heart of Las Vegas!</p><br>The Meridian has potential, but is not quite there yet<p>We stayed at the Meridian Luxury Suites for four days in November. We paid 132$/night through Expedia. For that price, we were overall pleased with the accommodations. However, had we paid the hotel’s advertised rates of up to $300/night, we would have been very disappointed. Here is my (very long) review:
Check-in: We arrived on a Thursday evening at 11:30pm. The front desk was closed (open 7am-11pm) so the security guard at the gate took care of check-in. He gave us the keys to our room, and the gates surrounding the resort. This only took about 5 minutes. The grounds are big and can be a bit confusing but the map that they gave us was helpful.
Room: Here’s where our troubles began. We had booked a one-bedroom suite (#2-319). At first sight, we were impressed: the suite is large and very nicely appointed. But upon closer inspection, we were not so impressed. For one, the bathtub was pretty much disgusting- totally grimy. It looked like it hadn’t been cleaned in a while. Both TVs (in the living room and the bedroom) did not work. The lights in the bedroom didn’t work either (there must have been a blown fuse or something). Since it was late, we decided we’d take care of it in the morning and just went to bed. We had difficulty sleeping because apparently, the air conditioning was not working either and it was about 83F in the room. Outside traffic noise was also a problem but luckily I had brought earplugs. The next morning, prior to calling the front desk about out room problems, I hopped in the shower. After about 5 minutes, the water turned ice cold. No more hot water! We called the front desk and they told us they would send someone to fix everything. When we asked when this person would come by, they said they had no idea. I might add, they didn’t seem at all surprised by the number of problems we had encountered with our room (nor were they apologetic). Finally, they offered to change our room. So a bellboy came to our suite and helped us bring our luggage to a 2-bedroom suite (#2-225). The upgrade was a nice touch. This room was better: air conditioning worked, TVs worked, etc. The suite was also quieter (less street noise). Unfortunately, the bathtubs were still grimy (the maid did not wash the tub once during our stay). Over the next couple of days, we experienced a few problems. The bathtub and sink in the en-suite did not drain properly, the curtains in the bedroom are not really blackout drapes (so if you like a really dark room, give this hotel a pass), one of the toilets kept clogging for no apparent reason, etc. The kitchen was very nice and mostly well equipped (pots and pans are of very low quality, but the rest of the plates/cutlery are fine). Since we spent most of our time outside of the room we decided that we could live with these inconveniences.
Location: The strip is a 10-minute walk away. I liked the location. In a previous stay in Las Vegas, we had stayed at the NYNY Hotel and Casino. Although that hotel is this right on the strip, it was still a good 15-20 minute walk from Centre strip (Bellagio, Caesars Palace, etc.) The Meridian is literally 10 minutes from these hotels. We rented a car, which we thought was very practical. There’s a grocery store about 2 miles east from the hotel on Flamingo called Albertson’s. It is open late and we stocked up on breakfast food. We felt relatively safe walking to the hotel late at night, although there were a few suspect characters on Flamingo, so if such things bother you, you might want to stay on the Strip. We weren’t too concerned about this- there’s always a lot of traffic on Flamingo and a fair number of people walking around. The Meridian itself is extremely safe (gated, lots of security).
Pool and grounds: This was a highlight of our stay. The pool area is very nice and was only busy during the afternoon (but still not that busy). We went a couple of times in the evening and had the whole area to ourselves. Spa and pool appeared to be very clean. We didn’t use the gym but it looked great (very large). The hotel also has a business centre where you can use the computer and printer.
Construction work: As other reviewers mentioned, there’s a lot of construction work going on. We weren’t too bothered by it except for our last morning. We awoke at 8am to the sound of hammers, heavy stomping and drills- seems they were working in the apartment above us. Excessive noise is not my idea of fun after I’ve been out late on the strip. We just wanted to sleep in but that clearly wasn’t going to happen.
Summary: Would I stay here again? Maybe, if I could get a good rate. This hotel is especially practical for families or groups of friends who want a quiet place to hang out away from the strip. We did enjoy taking a break now and then from the casinos and relax in our living room or by the pool. Some kinks really need to be worked out though before I can give this hotel a five star.
PS: In case you haven’t noticed, there are two different listings for this hotel on Tripadvisor. The hotel is listed as both The Meridian Luxury Suites and as The Meridian at Hughes Centre. Check them both out.</p><br>Best Hotel Ever Stayed In<p>The Meridian Luxury Suites is an excellent way to escape the Strip without being to far away. The suites were very large and accommodating to a weeks stay. We spent a majority of the time at the pool relaxing and enjoying the peaceful scenery. We also enjoyed the exercise facility and tennis courts. This hotel will be on our list to return in the Spring.</p><br>Best kept secret!<p>Needed two rooms or a suite for Vegas and happened upon the Meridian Luxury Suites. Loved the price for the two bedroom/two bath unit. Should be renamed Meridian luxury condos!! Great location. Walk about ten minutes to the center of the strip (Bellagio). Loved that we missed all the noise from the strip and not smokey like the casinos. Our unit was beautiful. Flat screen tvs, vcr/dvd combo, cable, full kitchen with new stainless steel appliances and coffee maker with coffee provided, laundry facilities in our unit with soap provided!! The pool was 24 hours and heated and we had it all to ourselves. There was a great business center where you can print out your boarding passes! Plus there's tennis courts, sauna, and a great gym!

Check in was a little rough. Like the other reviews, we had a little mix up with our room. Booked a two bedroom, but were sent to a one bedroom. However, one phone call and someone brought us up new keys and walked us over to our proper unit. Also the elevator was down on our side so we had to walk all the way over to the other elevator with no signs to guide us.

Over all, the experience was great and I will be staying there from now on!</p><br>Bad customer service<p>I stayed there a week ago and let me just say their customer service was horroible. The check in took about an hour to do which to me is ridiculous. The room I stayed in had light bulbs that didn't work, some of the sheets had stains on them. The last day I was there the cable went out for several hours and nobody notified me. I would not recommend this place to anyone.</p><br></body></html>
