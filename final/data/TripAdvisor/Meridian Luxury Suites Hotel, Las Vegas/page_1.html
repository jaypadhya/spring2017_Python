<html><head><h3>Meridian Luxury Suites Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 1</h3></head><body><br>Great Las Vegas Home away from Home<p>My wife and I stay for 6 months each year in 2 x 3 months stays we always stay at the Meridian Las Vegas this place is a gem.

All the negative stuff you hear must be bad luck stories as I have not seen any of this from the 24 hour secuirty to the 2 very clean pools, gym and rec room all just great.

The Meridian is only a 8 min walk to the strip great gardens Home away from Home (which is Australia)</p><br>Great for a long stay, awesome location, horrible realty agency<p>I've been here for two months while in town for work. Great apartments just two blocks off the strip, easy walk into the strip if it's not too hot. I have a one-bedroom place which is perfect for one person but slightly on the small side for two. The two bedroom places have a LOT of space. Great kitchens, really nice pool & BBQ area with clubhouse overlooking and tennis courts. 24hr gym with modern equipment. Fully furnished, modern apartments. Just do NOT go via Jennifer Martin Realty. They have been a nightmare trying to get things organized, it took three weeks and countless follow ups to have my Internet and TV connected and to just get access to the pool/gym area.</p><br>The Meridian is a total paradise resort<p>First of all whatever negativity you hear about this resort is all "bull." This is truely a gem hidden off the strip of LV blvd. If you like to relax after being on the strip and like to enjoy a romantic evening by the pool or just sit back on the balcany looking onto the lushes landscaping...well this is the place for you! Wow just one block of the strip and with tons of top notch restuarants just steps away it seems like you are in the carribeans somewhere. The resort is so quiet and peaceful with two gorgeous pools it really does seem like you are in the tropical world. Very well maintained property and I will be going back next month...this time with my entire family!</p><br>home sweet home:)<p>it was amazing... vegas was amazing.. meridian means luxury.. meridian means your home at vegas.. i really loved it we stay 3 days at Meridian and İ sware ı could cry while leaving...ıt was may vegas home and ı really want to stay there again,again,again :)</p><br>Very Noisy<p>Loud Wedding Music and DJ on Saturdays in the middle of the property. Tell them to turn the announcer mike down.. and music... and anyway who is profiting from the weddings. shouldn't us owners share the fees the mgmt is collecting?

Every 5 minutes night and day Low Roaring Jets taking off and landing right over the property...

Fire station down the street blaring sirens all night long.

Pool is not heated.. Very cold even in the daytime.
Only one hot tube is working.

Air and Heater noise constantly going on day and night even when you have completely turned yours off.</p><br>Well and truly let down by the Meridian!!<p>We were due to stay at the Meridian Luxury Suites for our Honeymoon (7th to 22nd September 2008). A day and a half before we were due to travel we discovered (via a review on this website) that the hotel had been closed down!!!
The Meridian did not have the decency to contact the travel agent to advise they were closed, and we can only assume that had we not checked ourselves, we would have arrived to find the Meridian closed. What a great start to our Honeymoon this would have been!!
We feel incredibly let down and suprised by this appaling lack of communication. We chose the Meridian following excellent reviews on this website, and its location only 2 blocks from the strip.
Fortunately, our travel agent were able to find alternative accomodation for us at the Hilton Grand Vacations Club (HGVC) nextdoor to the Hilton. This was after spending 1 1/2 hours on the phone the night before the wedding - I resent the Meridian for ruining what was supposed to be a special time for me and my bridesmaid.
On a positive note, the HGVC more than made up for the Meridians shortfall. Their customer service is first class!
If you are due to stay at the Meridian, we would urge you to double check your booking. Don't speak to the night time staff - they said 'don't worry, we are still open' !!! What????
Apologies for all the !!!! marks folks, we are still feeling pretty raw about our mistreatment by the Meridian.</p><br>Fabulous!<p>Fantastic Resort!!
I stayed July 1st through July 7th for my Fourth of July Wedding Celebration. I booked a total of 10 rooms for me and my 40 guests. All I can say is Luxury!!! When we arrived we were greated by security, who then smiled and opened the gates to the resort. We then checked into our room. Wow!! The rooms are exactly like the pictures and then some. We each had stainless steel kitchens with viking gas ranges, and sub zero refridgerators. The suites have unmentioned high end options such as push button comode with a built in badae... the commode even has a dryer to dry your tushie when your done...The maid service came, while we watched TV, and washed our DISHES, and then refused a tip. We had to basically force her to take the tip, which she split with the other worker.... Nice... My brother’s room had pillars, inlayed tile overlay, on marble flooring, and a full sized washer and dryer... Out of the 10 rooms I booked many were at least 1200 square feet. The largest being 1500 square feet. Over and over agian, each of our guests made comments like- "This suite is like MTV cribs" and "I feel like life styles of the rich and famous". One guest enjoyed her suite so much, she teared up, explaining this is the best resort she’s ever seen. Hands down, our friends and family were extremely impressed. The resort is the best part of our Vegas stay!! First Class all the way...

Traveler's tip on getting the most out of your stay
Make absolutely sure you are in a "Platinum" designer suite. The Platinum suites are the only ones that come with high end furnishings and finishes.. 2 bdr 2 bath w/den, can be pretty plain, unless you specify Platinum designer suite!! Also, make sure to get the gate codes to the pool. Trust me this property is high security.</p><br>Glad to hear it is closed<p>I am not surprised that the Meridian closed down. It was the most poorly run hotel I have ever stayed in. We had 6 rooms for a family reunion and all of them had problems ranging from no air conditioning to no hot water to no electricity whatsoever. They kept moving us around to different rooms that were not any better saying they "could not fix the problems". The staff was friendly, but not helpful, check-in took forever, housekeeping service was all but extinct, none of the 3 gate keys we had to use ever worked, etc. Kudos to the city of Vegas for closing them down!!</p><br>Meridian closed<p>I also received a messasge on my phone the night before I was flying from Anchorage to Vegas that the Meridian was closed due to a code problem or something. I was also offered the same rate at the Westin for one room. I had booked a two bedroom suite for 5 people so one room would not work. I called the Meridian but it was late and no one answered. The next morning I received a call from Meridian and they were very sorry but said the county made them close and they would not be reopening for a while. I was told I would receive a refund for the night I had paid for. Have not checked the credit card to see if it's there yet. Last minute booked two rooms at Planet Hollywood. Drove by Meridian while I was in Vegas and it was dark. Was very disappointed but still had a great time in Vegas.</p><br>Careful booking right now - not accepting short term reservations<p>Just a quick FYI that we were booked into the Meridian for July 22-26 and received a call on the 13th to advise that they no longer have their 'hotel' license...and are not able to accomodate anyone who has booked in with them for anything shorter than 30 days. They had transferred our reservation to the Platinum (another condo hotel) across the street - and had told us our rate and nights would be honoured. We were told that they are hoping to be up and running within 90 days after they fix whatever small details were required to get their license back.

We booked based on the many phenomenal reviews here at TripAdvisor, and to be honest, if and when they get their license we'd likely try it! We were pretty disappointed, and pretty panicked, as well. They did try and accommodate as best they could. The new booking at the Platinum, however, did not go terribly smoothly and while that hotel can now accomodate us for the dates we need (couldn't at first) we have made arrangements elsewhere.
Just a note if you are planning to travel there anytime soon!</p><br></body></html>
