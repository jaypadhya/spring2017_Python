<html><head><h3>Meridian Luxury Suites Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 4</h3></head><body><br>Possibly Best Hotel EVER!<p>We arrived at the Meridian on May 8, 2008 and we were pleasantly surprised to see that it is more like a luxury condo complex. A gate and guard to enter the complex made us feel very safe and like we were at a really exclusive place. We checked in around 11am which is early since most hotels are 2-3pm and they didn't bat an eye...got us right into a top floor room.

So, we walk in and are stunned to see this posh place decked out in leather, marble and granite looking like Ethan Allen came in and furnished the whole place! There was a full kitchen with stainless steel appliances (water/ice maker in fridge door!), really cool square dishes and a full spice rack among other things. Dining room, living room with an awesome flat panel TV and free wireless internet access! Bathroom had tons of space and the bedroom (also had flat panel TV) was beautiful and had a huge closet the length of one whole wall and the doors were all mirrors. There's a coat closet and another closet holding a washer and dryer with detergent already there!

The only issue we encountered was that the bathroom faucet was missing the screen so water splashed everywhere...well I briefly mentioned it to the concierge on our way out and we come home a few hours later...voila! Screen on bathroom faucet!

There are two gorgeous pools and beautiful lounge chairs that are like big couches...very chic! There are other great amenities that we didn't even get to...like tennis courts, sauna, and more stuff that I can't even remember.

The concierge was very helpful with all of our questions, making plans and she recommended some great towns to see and restaurants to eat at. I also found out that this place will stock your fridge before your arrival with anything you want! I think they have a grocery list that they email you.

The last day I was concerned because we flew Southwest, we had to check in exactly 24 hours before to get a decent place in "line", so I stopped at the front desk to ask if the kiosk they had there would print out my boarding pass and the she said it would but insisted on doing it for me! They were so helpful!

Housekeeping did an excellent job every day. It was very quiet...we barely ran into anyone. I really liked that you could go to the Strip for all the action and come back to a nice quiet relaxing place to sleep off all the partying ;)

I can not say enough good things about this place. The Meridian is just off of the Strip on E. Flamingo. You could walk to the Strip, but in summer heat I'd rather drive...especially since there's free parking at every casino!! For the location, accomodations and price, this place is UNBEATABLE!</p><br>Not very clean<p>I just returned from a weekend stay at the Meridian. I was wary about staying off the strip at this development as one of the reviews stated in was "filthy". The funny thing is that I just read a review of another person disputing this.

Well, here is my take. The location is very good and the rooms are very well appointed. However, outside of the rooms, yes the place is not very clean. The spacious pool area is amazing. However, the pool cushions are really dirty. (You must lay towels down on the cushions to avoid sitting on dirt) The pool decking is really dirty and did not want to walk barefoot on it. The bbq's at the pool are just plain disgusting and would never in a million years cook on them.

The other thing that was real disturbing was that I stayed on the 4th floor and the flooring is just unsightly. All the paint is peeling and coming up and it looks like the floor has not been swept in years. Just plain unacceptable. (The same garbage was on the floor for the 3 days I was there and was never picked up)

Another comment prior said it perfectly......If they can straighten out the cleanliness issues on the property, this place would really be a hidden treasure as no other property near the strip can duplicate the spacious feel of the property.</p><br>It's like having an apartment in Vegas<p>We booked a two-bedroom, two-bath suite at the Meridian through a deal found on Hotwire (Promotional code PROM1 on Meridian's reservations page).

After checking in, driving to our end of the complex, and lugging our bags upstairs from the garage, we discovered that our keys did not work. We called the front desk and were told they would send a bellman over with new keys. Thirty minutes later we called again and were told that it would be faster to walk over and grab new keys ourselves.

Service at the Meridian is next to non-existent. Housekeeping didn't clean our suite while we were out. You're basically renting an apartment with full-amenities and then you're on your own. Don't expect to be treated like you would at a casino/resort.

Staying off-Strip has its advantages (it's quiet) and disadvantages (no cabs!). On Saturday, we called the front desk and asked for help calling two cabs. We waited for 30 minutes and never saw one. We ended up trying to hail a cab from the Koval gate of the complex and were able to hail just one. The Strip is walking distance but if you must take a cab, you're better off walking over to the Westin Casuarina's taxi stand across the street.

The suites were fully equipped with a washer/dryer and all kitchen utensils and appliances (including a blender!). Beware, however, of dishes in the cabinet. We pulled out a couple of dishes with food still stuck to them!

The Meridian website claims that the 2 bed/2 bath suite has "private baths for each bedroom" but we found that only the master bath is private. The second bathroom is a guest bath located just outside the second bedroom. Floorplans and layout vary from suite to suite.

The decor is nice, the beds are comfy, the towels are plush, and showers are the BIG, rain-type. Lighting, however, is a problem. The suites are dark and have little artificial lighting. Our 2 bed/2 bath did not have a desk.

The pool was not heated. And by the way, the continental breakfast is not free. It's $1 per item. You're better off driving to the Albertson's down the street.</p><br>An Amazing Bargain!<p>This is an excellent place to stay if you don't want the craziness of the strip but want to be close to the strip. I just stayed here at the beginning of May (2008) for 3 nights. We had booked a studio apartment for $109/night (a special I found on the internet) and they upgraded us to a 1 bedroom apartment. Wow!!! What a deal. Compared to the standard hotel room, this place is definetly luxurious with a cute little dining/living area, fully equipped and very attractive kitchen, plush furnishings (the bed was sooo comfortable!), flat screen TVs, ipod docking station, AND a balcony (we ate breakfast there every morning). Where else can you get a deal like this close to the strip??!

A recent reviewer called it dirty!!?? I am dumbfounded by this accusation. This is something I always pay close attention to anywhere I go. Admittedly the pool lounges could use some updated cushions but other than that the pool area was a nice little haven. I sat in the jacuzzi and did not feel like it was dirty at all. The pool was heated and well maintained. There was beautiful landscaping around the pool. As far as the hallways and common areas, they were also very well-maintained (NOT dirty!). I am into being CLEAN and staying in a CLEAN and well-maintained facility. Our apartment was thoroughly cleaned every day and any employee I saw was always working hard to keep the place looking great.

I would rate this complex as Above Average (I would have given it Excellent ratings if the pool lounge cushions were updated and better maintained). But ya know, for the price, this place really can't be beat and I don't know how anybody could complain!

Underground/covered parking is a wonderful plus! Easy access to main roads and we felt very secrue as its a gated complex.

Location was good for us but we never walked to the strip. Honestly, I was a little bit surprised at the distance...its definately in walking distance but keep in mind its 2-3 gigantic blocks from the strip with several alleys and side roads in between the complex and the Blvd. Depending on where your accomodations are, it might take several minutes to just get to the main road outside the complex. I would say closer to a 15 minute walk to the strip. We always drove up to Imperial Palace (our friends were staying there) and used the valet. You already end up doing so much walking when you are on the strip and valet parking is free (just tip $1-2 when your car is returned), it just seemed more convenient.</p><br>Top Notch and Great Value<p>My wife and I just returned from Las Vegas after staying at the Meridian Luxury Suites. What a wonderful place. It's quiet and well kept. The rooms are absolutely fabulous! The room has a modern kitchen with all of the amenities. In also had designer furniture, flat screen TV's in the living and bedroom. Marble countertops and tile floors. Even coordinated couch pillows!
They truly give you the 'luxury' in Luxury Suites. The pool area was very nice. They have a couple of tennis courts. The whole 'community' is security gated. Just a 5 to 10 minute walk from the Strip. Underground parking. I can't say enough about the venue. The staff was extremely nice and helpful. Once again, it's quiet!! No gambling machines, etc.. on the premises. If you want to pay high prices and be part of the herd on the strip .. then don't stay here. If you want to relax and then go out to the tourist spots when you have the urge .. definitely stay here! Will stay here again and again! Thank you Meridian!</p><br>Meridian Top Hotel<p>I stayed at the Meridian in Las Vegas with my wife and kids and we loved it. The amenities were top notch, the kids loved the pool, I enjoyed the workout room. Our unit looked newly decorated and furnished and it was very clean. It's so close to the strip and the Meridian suites are perfect for families. The service was excellent as well. We would love to go back and stay there again next year.</p><br>Fantastic<p>I stayed at the Meridian while attending the NAB in April 2008. I was traveling with 2 colleagues, and all of us are non-smokers, and non-gamblers so the Meridian was perfect for us.

Perhaps we are more "low-maintenance" guests than some of the other writers, but we didn't have to have our rooms cleaned every day (although they were). The bathroom cabinet is stocked with at least half a dozen towels, so that's all we really needed.

We were more impressed with the spaciousness and attractiveness of the rooms, and the secure parking, than having someone at our every beck and call. After spending an entire day bumping into thousands of people at the NAB, the beauty and quietness of the Meridian was a nice change.

Since we had a rental car, transportation was not a problem and we were able to find a grocery store just a few blocks away.

One of my colleagues stated that he did not have hot water on one of the nights. He went to the front desk the next morning, and by the time we returned to our rooms that evening, the problem had been fixed. Also, the first night, the remote control for our garage didn't work. We stopped by the front desk and they fixed it instantly.

I honestly don't think the Meridian is for everyone. If you are looking for a hotel that will wait on you hand and foot, this is not that place, and honestly, you should probably be prepared to spend hundreds of dollars more to stay at a place like that. However, if your expectation is to stay at an upscale, gated hotel for an outrageously low price, and you're prepared to deal with maybe one or two inconveniences, then this is the place for you.</p><br>Great Room<p>We stayed four nights in this place in early February. We got a $99 per night promotion rate for a studio apartment from Travelzoo. Upon check in, we were upgraded to a one-bedroom suite for free. The suite we stayed was newly renovated, very modern and beautiful. I think that it is prettier and bigger than the same category room at Marriott Grand Chateau Las Vegas. However, the latter has perfect location, great views from the rooms. Jessie who led us to our room and helped with the luggage is very nice and helpful. Right after we checked in, we discovered that the window curtains in the living room was not installed and the cable didn’t get connected to the TVs in both rooms. We called the front desk and they told us that they would send someone to fix them. But it didn’t happen during our entire stay. Anyhow, it didn’t bother us much since we didn’t spend much time in our room. By the way, they claim that the place is only two blocks from the Strip, however, it is a long, boring walk. I don’t recommend walking to/from the Strip especially after dark. Since we had a rental car, it was very convenient for us to get on the Strip.</p><br>Wonderful rooms and staff!<p>From check-in to check-out our stay here was fabulous! I did not have any of the issues that others have listed. Housekeeping was timely and thorough, staff was courteous and helpful. We had a little trouble with the internet but a front desk person came up immediately and got it working and it worked fine for our entire stay.

I called the property directly and got an amazing rate for the 2 bedroom with den. The unit itself is absolutely gorgeous. The floors are marble and the kitchen is granite, marble and all stainless steel appliances. Gas range was a Wolf and refrigerator was a Sub Zero! I have never seen this in a suite. It was well stocked and we were very happy.

The living room and den all had leather furnishings and the dining room is very upscale. The living room even had a wet bar with wine cooler. The bedrooms are beautiful with excellent beds - better than my own - and flat screen TV's. The master bedroom has a walk-in closet to die for with rich wood built-ins, mirrors, cabinets, plush carpet - it is truly beautiful.

The grounds are beautiful and they welcome dogs. We brought our two and they have great places to walk them complete with mutt mits. We enjoyed both pools and hot tubs. One thing I look for in any hotel is the pool furniture. Even some nicer properties have strap lounges. These are all cushioned and there are umbrellas and gas BBQ's all around with great patio tables and chairs.

The location is like an oasis. It is only a little over a block to Bellagio and Paris and the best part of the strip and yet when you get back to property it is like a quiet haven.

The only thing I would like to see here would be the addition of a small convenience store. The one that is there is more of a convenience "closet" and there really isn't much to purchase.

We will definitely stay here again.</p><br>Nice, Quiet, and Peaceful<p>My husband and I stayed at Meridian this past weekend (April 19th - 22nd). We really enjoyed the place, it was very quiet and peaceful. I was a little bit hesistant about staying there after reading the mixed reviews, but I thought at the price it wouldn't hurt to give it a try. This was our first time going to Las Vegas, so I thought this would be a good place to stay at the price to find out how we really liked Vegas. When our taxi dropped us off, there was no one to there to get our bags so my husband had to get the cart himself and load our things. However, once we were in the office for check in someone came to take them to our room. We arrived early and was able to check in without any problems. Once we arrived at our room we were very pleased with the setup and decor. It was just like being at home. Everytime we went somewhere we would ask the front desk or the guard to call us a taxi and in no time one would arrive. However, after taking about 20 cabs during our stay, I do think that maybe the hotel should offer a shuttle service. I liked that there was a guard at the gate at all times and would check everyone before they came in. The only problems I found with the Meridian is that our refrigerator would never get cold. Since it kept the food and drinks at an okay temperature, I didn't bother to call and complain plus I wasn't sure how long it would take to fix or if we would have to move rooms. The stopper in the bathtub didn't work, so if I even wanted to take a hot bath, that wasn't happening. When the maid service came to clean our rooms they took all the dirty towels but didn't leave any small face towels. When we called the front desk they said they were out and didn't know when they would have any. My thought was if she knew she couldn't replace them she should have left them and I could've washed them in the machine. So for the duration of our trip we never received anymore face towels. I also noticed after the 2nd night when the room was cleaned, the dish towels were gone and not replaced. I'm not sure what this was all about. Don't take the towels if you aren't going to replace them, thats what they have a washing machine for. There were times when we would go to the front desk and they moved rather slow in getting with you. If they were on the phone or doing something else in the computer, they never acknowledged you. Overall, I liked the place for the price and I probably would stay here again. During the day we would go on the busy strip and at night we would come back to our quiet and peaceful room.</p><br></body></html>
