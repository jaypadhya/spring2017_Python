<html><head><h3>Meridian Luxury Suites Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 6</h3></head><body><br>Good Value<p>The Meridian was an excellent value. We got a great rate through a radio advertisement. The suite was well appointed. The full kitchen was outstanding and made eating meals much easier then going to a hotel resturant. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom was big enough for my wife and me. Don't expect all of the luxuries that a big resort on the strip is going to have. There is no spa, or, on site dining. That being said, it is quiet, a little off the beaten path and really close to the strip (anybody that says it is too far to walk needs to mix in a salad or two). A few small complaints.

- The phone system is set up the system in a condo so if you are trying to reach the front desk, it can be challenging.
- There were a few small housekeeping issues. Being a maid in this hotel must be much tougher then most other hotels because of the full kitchen. One of our glasses had a lipstick smear on it and the door to washer and dryer was broken.
- The curtains in the bedroom were too thin and the sunlight was pretty annoying in the morning.

Overall, it was still a very nice stay.</p><br>Everything we wanted, very pleasant stay<p>Stayed 6 nights in March 08 at The Meridian. We wanted an affordable place on or near the strip with a kitchen so we could provide some of our own meals. This hotel, which I stumbled upon on Travelzoo.com, was one of the nicest I've had in Vegas, and I've stayed at many LV hotels. We had a few smallish issues, but I consider these minor "nits," noted here only to help your decision.

LOCATION / LAYOUT: On Flamingo, about 10-12 minutes from the room to Bally's, The Meridian is truly walkable to the strip. There is no dining on site, but it is adjacent to Lawry's, and within 2-3 minutes of several restaurants on Flamingo. It's directly across from a small local casino (I forget the name). Overall, this is a very convenient location, and close to the airport.

There are 7 (?) condo complexes, each 4 stories plus underground garage. You get assigned parking - a HUGE plus if you have a car - and secure entrance (gated entry to complex and garage). If you are having visitors, make sure the gate security is aware, otherwise they may not get in (just ask my mom :-)

POOL / GROUNDS: Well maintained grounds. The pool was very nice, but modest in comparison to the gi-normous pools of hotels like Mirage or Bellagio. Lots of comfortable seating and a very large (15' diameter) hot tub.

The complex was relatively quiet, a kind of oasis close to the Strip.

-- NIT - they advertise the pool as heated to 79 degrees. It felt cooler than that, perhaps closer to 70, so it was a bit cool for my taste.

ROOM - A 1BR condo (they also have 2 BR and studios), this well appointed, clean, up to date room was very comfortable. The bedroom had a comfortable king bed, very large closet space and bureau. The living room / dining area had leather sofas, and both the LR and BR had cable flat screens. The deck was standard apartment size, enough for a small table and 2 chairs, which worked well. We had a view of a few of the hotels on the strip.

-- NIT: One of the sofas was in front of the deck entrance, making entry and exit to the deck a nuisance. The shades in the BR were not well fit, and thus let in a good amount of light; I prefer darker window treatments. The clock radio in the MBR was a pain. I understand all manner of electronics, and could not figure out how to turn the radio off.

KITCHEN - exactly what we needed, this kitchen, smallish but functional, had a full size refrigerator/freezer, gas stove / oven, d/w and enough dishware, glassware, storage and such for our purposes. We had breakfast and lunch here most days and, as a result, saved a lot of money. The hotel had a grocery service, very convenient and relatively reasonably priced.

-- NIT: I'd add a few more plates and perhaps a quality frying pan .

OTHER ROOM THINGS: It was very convenient having a washer/dryer in the room - great plus! Housekeeping provided laundry detergent upon request. The TV had problems, but a call to the front desk had it repaired within the hour. I loved hanging out on the deck. The bathroom had a rainshower (large) showerhead; this was OK but underwhelming. The rooms were all well kept, clean, modern and very comfortable.

SERVICE - generally attentive. I had the sense that the front desk staff was not particularly experienced (they were a bit hesitant on a few things), but they were certainly pleasant and focused on customer satisfaction.

-- NIT - The desk told us they could not tell which rooms had sofabeds and which did not. As someone with a hotel background, I found this odd. We compensated by bringing a $30 air mattress, but would've preferred to confirm a sofa bed. Also, be sure to ask for the entrance code to the secure gates throughout the complex; the desk only gives the pool code upon check-in.

OVERALL - The Meridian met or exceeded all the expectations of my family and I (wife and daughter shared the room). It's a great place if you want more space for rates at or below the major hotels. That said, the major hotels generally have more activity, casinos, on-site entertainment and dining, and in some cases more of a WOW-factor for their pools. I highly recommend The Meridian if you want to be close to, but not actually on top of, the strip and it's activities.</p><br>Very Nice!<p>Spent a Friday night with the boys at the Meridian. There were 6 of us and we piled into a 2 bedroom suite that was spacious, luxurious, and very modern. The decor was exceptional and the furnishings were extremely comfortable. Semi-Walking distance to the strip, you can be at Bally's/Bills/O'Sheas/Ceasars within 15min or so. Security is great, with a guarded gate and multiple card required entry points. The only negative of the Meridian is the amenities concerning vending and ice. Since this was a guys trip, we planned on making beverages in the room, and to our dismay, the ice maker in the refrigerator was not stocked and the metal bar was in the up position indicating "Off". No ice machine to be found in our building (Although a quick call to the desk would have probably solved the problem, ice should be available in close proximity to the units) Overall, this is a great place for extended stays, children, or groups.</p><br>nice stay<p>Best place to stay!! 10 min walk to the strip. quite and relaxing.
great service!t hats all I can say.</p><br>Ehhhh, just okay<p>Accomodations at Meridian are sufficiently satisfying. As other reviews state, the fully stocked kitchens, flat screen TVs, large couches and spacious beds make for a luxurious stay. The pool area is has ambience, and the outdoor grills are a cool touch, even if there rarely was anyone by the pool.

Unfortunately, our room had no hot water, which wasn't discovered until the next morning The front desk didn't seem suprised by this when contacted about it. They simply moved us next door. We asked for a late check-out the next in return for the inconvenience, but were told no rooms were available. They moved us to an empty room next door on a Friday night, but were going to be too booked to allow a 4 p.m. check-out the next night?

After my return from the stay, I discovered that Meridian had over charged me. Upon booking they charged 50% as a deposit. Upon checkout they charged the entire cost to my credit. So I was charged 150% what I should have been, and was relieved I caught the mistake, because Meridian certainly wouldn't have. I contacted them via e-mail, and recieved a "we're sorry" and my card was credited back the overcharge.</p><br>Luxury for Less<p>Travelzoo.com was advertising a special rate of $149.00 (one bedroom suite) for the Meridian Suites Las Vegas. I went online to the hotel website, then contacted the property directly to book. The location is great, next to the Hughes Center on Flamingo Rd., only a couple of blocks off of the strip. It is also in walking distance of several restaurants (Bahama Breeze and McCormick and Schmick are my personal favorites).

The Meridian is a controlled access property that is very similar in appearance to a condomimium complex. The units are currently being updated with neutral warm tones, plasma tvs, and stainless steel appliances in the kitchen. All of this does make it look and feel luxurious. I think that most of the suites also have a balcony and a fireplace. We found it to be very quiet and our balcony afforded fairly good views of the surrounding areas. There is a nice clubhouse with indoor raquetball and basketball courts, and exercise equipment; the outside ammenities include a heated pool and jacuzzi and outdoor grills for cooking. Free internet access is provided in the rooms and in certain common areas, you can also get wireless internet access. In addition, the room rate includes free parking in a secured covered garage and there were no extra fees for using any of the ammenities.

The management and staff were very friendly and helpful. Although they accidentally assigned us to a one bedroom suite that had not been cleaned, they redeemed themselves by upgrading us to a two bedroom suite on the top floor. I personally prefer this property to any other hotel I have stayed in while in Las Vegas. We come to Vegas three times a year on business, and I would recommend this property to anyone who is staying more than 2 nights.</p><br>Loved the Meridian<p>The Meridian is a very nice hotel. It has all the latest updates, affordable, spacious and down right gorgeous. This hotel is within walking distance to strip. I would book at the Meridian again. Pictures on website exactly like hotel. Celebrated my birthday weekend there. Outstanding landscaping as well. You will enjoy.</p><br>Great place...so quiet!<p>I've just come back from a wonderful week at the Meridian. I must say that some of the reviews made me worry a little but none of those negatives really affected my stay in any way.

I arrived at 11:30 PM with a rental vehicle. My reservation was ready to go at the front desk (which has service 24hrs a day). They gave me a list of grocery items they could aquire for me (with a fee of course).

After parking my vehicle in the covered and locked parking lot under the building I was assigned to, we arrived in our hotel room (which to be honest is more of a condo than anything else). The kitchen was great with full size appliances and everything needed to create meals. The bedrooms we're a very nice size. The master has it's own washroom and a large walk-in. The secondary room has a washroom attached but not within the same room.

Pros...
Gorgeous room.
Wired internet (wireless available at pool only).
Very quiet and safe neighbourhood.
Staff that go out of their way to help you.

Cons...
Walls are very thin. (I must say this only affected me twice during my stay...the first night...some partiers got back late and let everyone know...the last night...work being done in the unit above us at 7 AM)
Didn't get much info about Las Vegas from concierge. Most info we got was from going to other hotels and getting their concierge to provide the info needed or getting info online.

I enjoyed my stay. I will most likely return to this location should I return to Las Vegas. Don't let some of the negative reviews scare you. You are renting a condo for the duration of your stay with all the luxuries expected.</p><br>RE: good for families<p>We (2 parents and 2 kids) stayed in a 2 bdrm 2 bath 1 parking (for our rental car) at the Meridian (rm 7333) from 2/14/08 to 2/18/08 while attending a family wedding. We booked the unit through Travel Link, which manages more than one unit on the property.

The good: 1) it was spacious; 2) it was clean (no smoke smell); 3) the maintenance people were nice (when we arrived the toilet in the master bath didn't work and there was a queen bed instead of 2 twin beds in the second bdrm). The maintenance man fixed the toilet and brought up a rollaway (and charged for it); 4) its within walking distance of the strip; 5) its quiet; 6) its secure; 7) it has a washer/dryer stack in the unit; 8) There is a HD tv in the living room and in each bedroom; 9) Travel Link was very easy to work with: 1/2 deposit (which includes a cleaning fee) on booking and the other 1/2 a month before your stay.

The bad: 1) there are no long distance calls from the room; 2) there is no printer in the business center; 3) there are no black out curtains and so the light comes in from the street; 4) the business center closes at 6 pm and so if you are out and about during the day, you can't pick up email when you return; 5) there are no restaurants/room service on the property and there is no grocery store nearby (we drove to albertsons and then used the refrigerator and microwave a lot); 6) maid service came only once during our 5 day stay; 7) the bathtub in the second bathroom had a drip that was irritating (but that could happen at any hotel).

Summary: The cost is reasonable and its good for families but not if you have any business to conduct during your stay.</p><br>Luxury, Great Rates Near The Strip<p>Wow! I was pleased with this condo complex turned hotel. It felt like we had the whole place to ourselves. This hotel was completely remodeled in 2007 and the results are great! The decor is modern, hip and comfortable. Having a full kitchen, dining, and separate living room is great. Also has a washer/dryer in the room.

We got our room for 4 days on a special we found on the internet and booked it on the Meridian website. The hotel is only 2 blocks off the strip and is completely secured with full time attendants at each entrance. The fitness center, pool, business facilities are great. They also offer DVD rentals. Free wifi in the rooms - which is hard to find on the strip - usually there is a daily fee.

The only 2 things I didn't like was that 1) the front desk is only open until 11pm...not that we needed the front desk after 11pm...there is an answering service on call from 11pm to 7am. 2). The window coverings in the kitchen and bedroom were a type of bamboo shade - completely see through. They looked great but I ended up covering the one in the bedroom at night to give a little more privacy and to block some of the light outside.

Other than those 2 minor things, our stay was perfect. We will definitely recommend this hotel to others...and stay there ourselves.</p><br></body></html>
