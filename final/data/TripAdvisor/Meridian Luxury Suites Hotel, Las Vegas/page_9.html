<html><head><h3>Meridian Luxury Suites Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 9</h3></head><body><br>Great Stay, Great Location!<p>I recently stayed at the Meridian after finding a great rate online and was suprised on how nice this place is. I booked a one bedroom suite and found it to be very very nice! It is great to wake up and sit on your balcony in the morning overlooking the pool and gardens, no stinky casino here. My wife and I walked one block up and watched the water show at the fountains of Belagio and had dinner at Laundry's Steakhouse right next door to the Meridian. The properties grounds,pools and suites made us feel like we were at a Scottsdale resort right smack in the heart of Vegas.</p><br>Luxury at a Great Price<p>My son and I went to Vegas for a week to take part in the AAU National Basketball Tournament. We stayed at an apartment complex about 2 blocks from The Bellagio called The Meridian (250 Flamingo Ave) which is in the process of being transformed into a hotel. The unit we had was luxurious and spacious - 2 bed, 2 bath, balcony, walk-in closet, leather wrap-around couch with a flat screen TV, full kitchen, washer/dryer, undergroung parking with gated entry, 2 pools, fitness center with locker room, raquet ball court, club room for functions, 2 tennis courts... compared to the night we spent at the MGM Grand this was a pleasure and a bargain.

Because it is still in the process of being transformed into a hotel there are some basic hotel functions that aren't in place at this point such as 24 hour front desk but there are 24 hour guards on duty and some extremely dedicated employees that are willing to do all they can to make your stay enjoyable. They are also in the planning stages to include a restaurant. There are some great places to eat within walking distance and the Strip is about a 1/4 mile walk. We had a car during our stay because we were traveling around the Las Vegas area.

I am writing this because I love to find luxury at a bargain and also because these people were working so hard to get this project off to a great start that I was impressed with their ambition and drive. They were doing all they could to insure our stay was great. I am hoping they succeed in case I have to visit Vegas again for next year's tournament.</p><br>Awsome Place to stay.<p>We stayed at the Meridian for 2 nites,

The stay did not start off well when we tried to check in, The staff on the front gate sent us to the reception centre to check in but they new nothing about short term rental as they only do long term?. Well that did not impress me, How ever they let me use there phone to call my internet hotel provider and was told i was in the right place but not sure where to go from there, I was asked to leave the office building as they could not help me and did not want me waiting there for a return call on my cell phone.
I waited in the car park for an hour for the call to let me no where to go to check in, I was told to go back to the main gate and the guards there have all the info for me. When i arrived back at the gate they told me they did"nt no that they had the package for me to pick up as they had not done anything like this before, (a realy great idea that was)

Anyway after 2 hours of delay and a headache from the drama i went thru, We headed to our room.

We had a map to find the room but we got lost trying to find it as it was a maze like a rabbit warren.

We finally got to our room as were very impressed of what we were given, It was like new in the apartment, It was a really nice place with great location just a few blocks from the strip, It had every thing you would expect from an apartment sytle rental, I recomend that you have a car to stay here as it is a little far away from the action to walk every where,

The 2 bedrooms were large but the living area was a little small i thought, Oh well hard to get it all i spose, A great place to stay with a larger family or 2 couples as it would sleep way more than 4 if you had some bedding with you.........................................</p><br>best place to stay<p>The condos are out of this world. Decorators taste is fabulous. You must rent the 2 bedroom platinum condo. It has everything you need except wireless internet access. In a gated community, safe and clean!! Loved it. I have stayed in the 1 bedroom and also the 2 bedroom condos. Try it ! you won't regret the stay and you are still close to the strip!</p><br>Dirty<p>Unit 223, was upon opening the door greeting you with a filty carpet, blinds in bedroom window and patio door were missing letting in light making it inpossible to sleep. unit faced street and noise from cars and emergency vehicles was constant through out the night, for sleeping forget it. On the plus side the building other units were very quiet and close to the strip. I would not recommended using this company</p><br>The best home in town<p>I have lived at The Meridian for 6 months now and LOOOOOVE IT! I have met all kinds of people, lived in luxury, partied at the strip, shopped, and sooooo much more. The best thing about the place is the management. They are always on top of things and truely care for the residents here. I would live here for the rest of my life if I could.
My maintenece request always get done as soon as possible too!!!! Every thing in their fitness center works! I think everyone who wants to move to Vegas should live here. Missy</p><br>Home Away From Home<p>My husband and I stayed here 9/26-10/3/03. It was nice. However, its apartment living. All requests had to be called in. There is no 24 hour front desk. The concierge was good for calling a cab or renting tapes.
However, for maintenance problems or other situations, you had to call between 9am-5:30pm. Check in is 5 pm,so if there was a situation, it was taken care of the next day and who wants to sit around on vacation waiting for help to come? The lighting on the outside could improve, but the Westin is opening up which will be better because it's a little deserted on the block. Overall, not a bad place to stay if you like total privacy and require very little assistance. You may need a car because 3 blocks in the sun or after a long day could be quite a distance after a few days. The staff on the phone and on the premises were very nice. You won't be disappointed.</p><br>Great and Relaxing<p>My wife and I stayed here and were very impressed with the facilities. The rooms were huge and had everything you needed. Only 3 blocks from the Strip, which is an easy walk. I will definitely stay here again in the future.</p><br>staying near The Strip in quiet and safe temporary apartment<p>For our trip to the Consumer Electronics (CES) trade show, my wife and I stayed in a wonderful corporate housing apartment at Oakwood's Meridian Apartments location on Tropicana Blvd.

We loved the quiet and convenience. A walk of about three standard city blocks took us to The Strip. In the mornings, we walked about two blocks through the serene Hughes Center complex to a Starbucks. And to get to CES, we walked the one-quarter mile distance, saving ourselves the hassles of dealing with the traffic.

Our furnished apartment had everything we needed. It was almost surreal having so much peace and quiet just a few blocks from The Strip, being able to avoid taxi/auto travel, elevator waits, etc.</p><br>Meridian Luxury Suites, Las Vegas<p>Die Suites im Meridian sind für mich schöner, als z. B. die im Caesars oder MGM. Die Einrichtung ist absolut schön und teuer. Wir hatten eine Suite mit 2 Schlafzimmern und waren restlos begeistert. Die Küche ist komplett eingerichtet, das Wohnzimmer mit riesen Plasma Bildschirm und gemütlicher Couch sowie Essecke und ein Balkon runden das ganze ab. Besser als in jedem Hotel ! Leider kann man im Meridian nicht mehr Tageweise buchen, sondern nur noch ab 2 Wochen. Die Preise sind allerdings erschwinglich und wer länger in Vegas bleiben möchte, ist hier absolut richtig. Der Pool ist einer der wenigen in Vegas, der 24 Stunden am Tag geöffnet hat.</p><br></body></html>
