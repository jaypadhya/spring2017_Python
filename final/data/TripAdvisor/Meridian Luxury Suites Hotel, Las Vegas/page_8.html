<html><head><h3>Meridian Luxury Suites Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 8</h3></head><body><br>Not a resort hotel but a rental unit<p>This is not a resort hotel but a complex of rental units about 15 years old currently being renovated. We tried to check in at the front desk and were handed back to security who had a package from one of 4 companies managing the units. There is no room service, no restaurants, no housekeeping, etc. If you like to ride elevators with construction workers, this is the place. If you like getting telemarketing calls in your unit 6-7 times a day, this is the place. If you like washing your own towels, this is the place. If you like noise and firetrucks going regularily by this is the place. The internet did not work and it took two days to get someone out to fix it.
Yes the furniture was nice, the pool nice, etc. but I did not expect this when I booked with orbitz. $300/night for a rental unit 15 minutes off the strip is not good value.</p><br>Please...just a little "piece" of quiet! Otherwise, great location.<p>This is a property with a catch and for me that catch is critical because I'm not very good if I can't sleep.

The room is gorgeous. Flat screen TV, Cable Internet, DVD/VCR, top quality furniture, tasteful design. Excellent bedding, lighting and fully equipped kitchen;washer and dryer in a separate closet.

What's missing are curtains that stop light. Las Vegas isn't known for
clouds, so you can expect full light to rouse you at the crack of dawn
because the curtains are translucent.

If the light doesn't do the job then, maybe the neighbor's plumbing will. Any time the water is turned on, a very loud rushing water sound
comes right through the wall next to the bed's headboard.

Then there are the row of air conditioning fans just outside your window. There's eight of them and they go on and off all night long.

But wait! There's more. The loading and unloading of trucks with their
lyrical bleating backup tones joined in harmony by the backup beeps from tractors working nearby. It's a symphony of insommnia!

Front desk staff: impeccable. Property security: Ditto. Location: Excellent.

The key to this property is getting a room that's both quiet and has curtains unless you're not light sensitive. If you have quiet then this place is pretty suite.</p><br>Great Customer Service<p>I booked a great rate at the Meridian on Orbitz. Surprisingly, the units were exactly as it looked online. We originally booked the one bedroom which was comfortable, but the people above us were stomping around upstairs all hours of the night. We thought we would nap during the day, but workers were renovating the room next door. After 2 nights of no sleep, I went to the front desk and they upgraded us to a 2 bedroom on the top floor. The 2 bedroom was much nicer than the 1 bedroom and we were very happy that no one was above us.

The entire property is gated which made us feel very safe. The pool is beautiful and very relaxing. I'm really glad we stayed at a non-gaming resort. We were looking for a relaxing vacation and we got it at the Meridian.

The only thing I would suggest as an improvement would be to add a restaurant or some kind of food service on site. There were places within walking distance, but it took us a day or two to get our bearings and to stock the kitchen with snacks. it would've been nice to have some place on site. They did have a menu for a delivery place in the suite, and we did use them the first night, but they never showed with our food. In addition, the prices were outrageous ($15 for cheesesteak, $6 for 2 liter soda)Instead, we feel asleep waiting for them. Minor point, but worth noting.

I would highly recommend this resort to anyone staying more than 5 days in LV and looking for some rest and relaxation.</p><br>Excellent<p>Stayed in a 2 bed condo. Everything brand new, excellent "classic modern" design of browns, great appliances. Excellent location right off the mid-strip near the Flamingo.</p><br>Great Deal<p>Had a beautiful 2 bedroom condo with our son and his family. This was over Labor Day Weekend and it was peaceful there away from the crowds on the strip. It's a good 20 minute walk to the strip. The pool was lovely.

They are renovating the whole place so it's a little confusing to the new staff. But all in all, the condo was great...with a very expensive kitchen appliances, although we didn't do any cooking.</p><br>Superior Experience<p>We just returned from a wonderful stay at the Meridian Luxury Suites in Las Vegas. Superior value!! The hotel room (actualy they were fully furnished upscale apartments) was just as advertised. Total luxury (we were upgraded to a 2 bedroom suite) with about 900 sq. ft. of living space. Full kitchen complete with everything you could possibily need along with a washer/dryer (nice surprise). The hotel was non-gaming facility. Just across the main entrance was a hotel/restaurant/casino and the main strip was just a half mile away. Since this was a gated community, there wasn't a taxi stand (across the street if your in a hurry) but the hotel would happily call for one to meet you at the main entrance. The main pool area was terrific and never crowded. The hotel staff and employees were very helpful and friendly. We will definetly recommend this beautiful location to all we know, and stay here again on our next trip to Las Vegas!</p><br>Lovely apartment<p>This was by far the most luxurious and the cheapest accomodation we had stayed in throughout our holiday/vacation. We booked a 2 bed Platinum Suite for 3 adults and it was swish!! Leather sofas, plasma TVs, mirrored walls in lounge, huge fridge/freezer and cooker. You could easily cater for yourself here on the odd night. I made use off the washer and dryer as we were halfway though our vacation. They even left us small packets of soap powder. However, it was dusty and our balcony furniture was particularly dusty but we wiped it over ourselves even though reception offered to send someone.
For me I hate elevators and high rise, so this was PERFECT! It was a good 20 minute walk to the Strip but I liked the fact we were off strip and it was a secure, gated community.
I used the pool - not crowded at all, plenty of loungers. The Staff were happy to phone for taxis and when we were stood up by a taxi driver on the one night we had show tickets, the Manager even offered to drop us off to the Mirage himself. When I offered a tip to the desk guys - they refused!
They certainly have plans for this place and I would definately go back without hesitation.</p><br>Nice condo, but too much construction<p>We recently stayed 4 nights in condo #7113. When we arrived, the regerstration desk had no info on our reservation. Luckily we booked the room on their website, and had the confirmation email. Regerstration clerk was nice, but there is a lot of confusion. They did not seem to know which condos were vacant or occupied, it took 20 minutes to find a room for us. We ended up getting a 2 bedroom, instead of the 1 bedroom we booked because no 1 bedrooms were available. Beware, when checking in they give condo key cards and a front gate/ garage remote control, but if you lose either, there is $150 charge, which seemed awful steep for a plastic room key.
On a walk to our condo, we were surprised at how much construction was going on. There seemed to be no real security during the day because the complex was overrun with construction workers.
When we got to our condo, we we impressed, rooms look just like the pictures on their website, but none have good views of the strip. Our patio over looked at parking lot.
During the two mornings of our stay, the condo next to us was being renovated, (very few units are finished, with some appearing to be still leased out as apartments). The construction started promptly at 8am. There was lots of pounding on the adjoining wall. I think they were installing the crown molding, and installing floor tile. I tried to call the desk to complain, but the phone number on our check-in paper work was for the reservation center located somewhere else, and when they tried to transfer me, the phone just rang. I did not really want to deal with the regerstration desk confusion again, so we just put up with it.
All in all, I would recommend staying here but wait until all the construction is complete.</p><br>What a mess!!<p>If you love dirt, noise, broken down elevators, confusion, lack of security and a 15 minute walk to the strip while paying strip prices, then this place is for you. Difficult to tell (no one there can or will) when the major costruction will end. Ultimately this might be a good place to stay but today it is a disaster.</p><br>Lots of Construction Work<p>There is a ton of construction going on at this place. Every morning at 7 am we were awakened by drilling, sawing, and yelling construction workers next door. It was annoying, and we tried contacting the front desk, but they told us they couldn't do anything about it.</p><br></body></html>
