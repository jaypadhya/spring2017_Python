<html><head><h3>Nellis Suites at Main Gate Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 2</h3></head><body><br>Great place for a great price<p>I wasn't sure about this place in the beginning because it sits right behind a bar but my brother was in town and I needed a bigger hotel room. Since I already had a hotel on base I would be keeping I didn't want to spend a lot of money on hotel number 2. We got a two bedroom suite. I think I paid 350 for the entire week but it had a full up kitchen and 2 nice sized rooms. The front desk had the nicest employees. The rooms were well kept and the bathroom was clean. The a/c unit was LOUD in the second bedroom and every time it kicked on or off it would scare the living crap out of me. We also had to deal with the occasional cigarette smoke that filtered in the room. But we never heard our upstairs tenants and the fitness center was decent considering how cheap it is to stay at these suites. The pool area was pretty and well kept. The environment was extremely friendly and laid back. I HIGHLY recommend this place unless you have fancy taste. Housekeeping is once a week and you have to pay for extra toilet paper and supplies.</p><br>Clean, provided all I needed<p>I stayed at Nellis suites with a large group. Our check in was seamless and efficient. The suite was recently redone, as most of the suites on property have been. The property was clean as were the rooms. The rooms were spacious and provided enough room for the five of us. There was a kitchen with everything needed to cook basics. It is out by the Air Force base and away from the strip, but we were at a race that was held close to this property. I would definately recommend this property to families or groups</p><br>Good place for the price<p>Was a really nice hotel for what I needed. Was visiting Vegas with friends to do a Spartan race. The Nellis Suites were close to the race and a good comfortable clean place to stay. It's about 20-30 minutes from the strip, but very close to the Las Vegas Motor Speedway and the Spartan Race location.</p><br>Will be staying there again<p>At first I wasn't too sure about the place. But the staff was super friendly and the suite was really clean. Had everything I needed for a comfortable stay. Plenty of parking and areas around it where we could eat. Great for the price.</p><br>Pleasantly surprised! <p>I travelled to Vegas the first weekend of April for a Spartan Race. I chose Nellis because of its proximity to the race venue. I needed large fully equipped suites to accommodate room sharing with fellow racers and Nellis fit the bill perfectly with their extended living suites. Full kitchen, very serviceable living space, 2 bedrooms with comfortable beds and everything was very clean! The grounds were well taken care of and attractive, pool and jacuzzi, laundry room facilities and the office staff was very kind and helpful. My reservation alone was for twelve 2 bedroom suites covering more than 50 people, and many other racers stayed there in addition to my group. Every person I spoke to was pleased with their rooms and with the service. Many people shudder at the thought of staying near North Las Vegas, but this property is tucked in off the road, has good parking and even has a roving security gaurd. We all felt very safe and comfortable here and I would happily recommend them to anyone. :)</p><br>Find another Hotel<p>I looked Nellis Suites via Hotels-Rates.com for $99/night. When I showed up they wanted to charge $138/night. Even after I showed them my confirmation paperwork with the lower price, they said it is not a rate they charge. Staff is rude. Place is noisey (next to Air Force Base). It is way out in the middle of nowhere.</p><br>Nice place, great people, real value<p>We stayed here yet again for a regional gymnastics meet, rather than at the meet hotel. The cost was significantly less, and the suite was exactly what we needed.

We are a special needs family, and the staff made certain we had everything we needed. This really made the difference for us.</p><br>Very Clean HOME SWEET HOME<p>The Down Side even Paradise has it down side.at 06:30 get ready to get tossed out of bed as you are within shouting distance to Nellis Air Force Base.Rebelly{cant spell}the opposite of taps is blast over the loud speakers.other than that the jets are a TAD NOISY but my friend Ex Navy CPO calls it the sound of FREEDOM haha.and yes they do fly over the motel.your as safe as can be but walking towards Wal Mart my seem a little seedy.</p><br>Hotel itself not bad....people who work there - another story<p>Staying there for business and it's been so hard to find someone who knows what's going on. I'm put on hold for long periods of time, told I need to call back because they are too busy to talk to me or what not. Our guys' room keys have to be reset due to incompetence. Overall just a frustrating place!!! The guys say that the place is definitely NOT what is shown on the pictures - not even close. They have kitchens but no pots and pans....do people just randomly travel with pots and pans in their bags???? Seems like everyone is walking around bumping into each other at the front desk.</p><br>Not bad for the $. Loudest A/C unit EVER!<p>My wife and I arrived for the NASCAR race and stayed three nights. The room was clean and in good order upon arrival. Bedding and bathroom was clean as well. The kitchen area was NOT equipped as advertised. The appliances all worked, but without pots or pans, forget it! Overall, the room was kind of bland and outdated but cleanliness comes first in my book. After all we were there to see the race, not see the room. Oh yeah, the AC unit was so loud when running, we could not sleep at all until we shut it off. Not a big deal in the month of March, but I could not imagine having to deal with that in the heat of summer. It was just not our room either. It was noisy in ALL rooms.</p><br></body></html>
