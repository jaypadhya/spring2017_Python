<html><head><h3>Nellis Suites at Main Gate Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 4</h3></head><body><br>Still a decent place.<p>This is a great alternative for people that want separate sleeping areas. All the rooms that I have stayed in are apartment style, kitchen, two separate sleeping areas with different configurations of beds.

It is a little unsettling that there is armed security on property, but OK.

We went to the buffet Sunday morning and it was a wreck, not maintained, juice machine leaking, the buffet was not stocked.

Not much close here but a weird dive bar we like called Club 25 that has some typical bar food, pool tables, weak beer selection, but you can stumble back to the hotel from here. Easily.

We would definately come back.</p><br>Comfy stay<p>My daughter & I enjoyed our stay @ Nellis Suites. The rooms are not fancy but very comfortable. The first night we stayed in a suite that had 2 bedrooms. The furnace was behind the wall in one of the rooms and when it kicked on it was noisy. We finally just turned it off The second night we were in a 1 bedroom suite. We never turned the furnace on so we don't know what that would have been like. Everything was comfortable. Full kitchenette...regular size fridge, stove, microwave & dishwasher. The outdoor pool is nice and actually HEATED, and they have a hot tub. The management was awesome to work with. Drake is your front desk manager & will take good care of you as well as the other people that work there. Continental breakfast, mostly carbs.
Room Tip: Our activities were located downtown LV at the conventions center. It only took about 15 to 20 minu...

The free breakfeast consits of lots of muffins, oatmeal, cereal, and drinks, except weekends you get waffels, and bagles. Across the street from Air Force Base, so jets fly over all the time. That's freedom flying over your head it's ok! The area is very safe and a lot of perm. residents live at hotel. Close to bus station and places to eat. There is a 25 club that serves good food and is a full bar, lots of history there. Hotel to the strip is about 20 min. drive but lots of casinos within a 7 mile radius. I would stay here again. Heated pool and super hot hot tub. Full laundry $1.50 wash and $1.25 dry They have Wi-Fi $10.78 a week
Room Tip: Rooms in the back (C) building is quiet no elevators on site
See more room tips</p><br>Booking another stay right now<p>These suites are much more like apartments, than they are like hotel rooms. If you are expecting the trappings of The Venetian, then go there and pay the price.

We get to Vegas twice or three times a year. This trip will make the fourth time we have stayed at the Nellis Suites. They are not the lap of luxury - they are better than that. They are just like being at home! Same comfort, same services. You do have to get a new wireless password every day, but that is to keep people from stealing their wireless service.

We have never had a dirty suite. We did have a suite with a non-working microwave. We told the desk as we left for breakfast, and the wave was replaced before we got back.

If you live in a penthouse, this is not the place for you. Take your entourage to the Wynn. If you don't know the difference between an apartment and a luxury suite, don't stay there. There are no suites with putting greens on the balcony. Nellis Suites are for normal people, and for Airmen, up to E-8 or so, and for officers up to O-5 or so. Angel and I have never been even slightly disappointed with the Nellis Suites.
Room Tip: If you need rooms for mobility impaired people, tell them when you make your reservation.
See more room tips</p><br>Bare Bones and Barely Stayable<p>If you are only looking for a night and won't be in the room it may be ok but not otherwise. We needed to go on base so the location was perfect for that purpose. The furnishings and carpet are woren and dated. Our toilet didn't work correctly and everytime we flushed we would have to take lid off back of tank and adjust. The bathroom door wouldn't close. For a 2 bdrm suite there was only one tv in the living room. We were in a smoking room but they told us they didn't have ashtrays. There were minimal dishes and cooking utensils to use. No potholders, paper towels, dish clothes, or regular dish soap. There were 4 hangers in the closet. When sitting down on the couch you sunk practically to the floor. The kitchen table hadn't been wiped down and when I wiped it the rag was black from all the dirt. Bottom line: If you can find somewhere else to stay -- DO!!</p><br>Everything was horrible.<p>My husband, our 4 year old son and I are staying here currently (12/29/12) and I have to say this is the worst hotel I've ever been to. We're a military family waiting to move to Nellis so we decided to stay here as the temporary housing on base is more expensive. The moment we walked in I hated it. It reeked of cigarettes, the green carpet looked filthy, the bed is way too hard (I mean, concrete hard!), the stove has a burning smell to it, the walls are too thin (I spent last night listening to the neighbor snore), the tube tv turns off about 20 times before staying on, room service only comes once a week, the trash can is the size of a bathroom wastebasket, you're given 2 towels, 2 cups, 2 spoons and 2 forks. The neighborhood (aside from the airforce base) is super ghetto and the coffee pot nearly caught fire when I plugged it in.</p><br>Not the Ritz, but OK for a few days<p>A couple of comments about previous notes. This hotel is 10 years old, and the furniture is probably the original. When you check in, you see a note saying toilet paper, $1.00; Kleenex , $1.00 a box. If you are staying for a long time-extended stay-, you pay for extras. Not, if you are day to dy. We were there for 6 days, and it is like a regular hotel. Housekeeping, and the front desk folks were very nice and accommodating. We had a couple of minor mechanical issues and were taken care of quickly. Yes there is dark green carpet, and it would not hurt to update the rooms. BUT, the rooms were clean. We had 2 queen beds, and they were pretty hard. The word suites is kind of a misnomer.....it is a 2 room hotel with a kitchen, and sitting area. One irritant is the cost. In Las Vegas, hotels have this resort fee. The Nellis Suites Are NOT a resort, but they charge $5.00 a night. Why not just up the ante on the room? They do accept pets. Good news. They charge $25.00 per stay-not per day. So if you stay a few day.s, it isn't too bad. Bottom line, it is an OK stay, and the price is reasonable. They also have a 2 bedroom "suite" as we'll. hope this helps.
Room Tip: Upper floors don't have elevators, so if you need access ability, ask for 1st floor. Rooms in th...

This motel (it isn't a hotel) was pretty dated. At first, I wanted to leave, but it was close to the assignment I had, so I stayed. I asked if there were any nicer rooms and was told there weren't any.
At first, it looks very bad, but it was clean. It is just that everything is old. Old carpet, old bedding, old towels, old furniture. It is an extended stay hotel, so your room only gets cleaned once a week and they charge for a roil of toilet paper. The food in the morning was decent except the donuts that they store all together so they all had a stale blueberry smell from the blueberry muffins and donuts. Also, only little-kid yogurts, no big-kid yogurts.
I guess the reason I'm giving this motel a low rating is to say they need to upgrade.
Room Tip: The adjoining "25" bar/restaurant is not part of the motel. DO NOT GO THERE unless you ar...
See more room tips</p><br>Ok for the price<p>Management could stand to do some deep cleaning. Either rent a carpet cleaner or hire someone. Price and location worked for what we needed, but if we were spending anytime in the rooms we would probably have left.</p><br>Ghetto!<p>Wow! The photos are deceiving! Do not stay at this hotel unless you plan on getting a disease of some sort. That is not a compliment. The rooms, 2007 in our case, have dark green carpet that have NEVER been cleaned! The beds come to about your shins and have noticeable sinking where residents have lived there and caused the mattresses to droop around their bodies. The atmosphere is nothing but ghetto! And if you request non-smoking, you will get other horrible smells that only your mind can imagine what it is! The last gentlemen said he almost cried, well we did! It is the worst feeling that you get as you pull up to check in. We didn't even allow our children out of the car. Once we checked into a hotel down the way, they told us to pack a gun to stay there... Fully agree! DO NOT stay here if you have learned anything from the last two reviews. It isn't clean at all and if I could give it zero stars I would. I made sure we wrote a review first thing back home so no one makes the same mistake. Not a 3 star hotel by any means, try 1, no negative 1!</p><br></body></html>
