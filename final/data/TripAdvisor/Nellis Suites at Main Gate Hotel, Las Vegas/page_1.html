<html><head><h3>Nellis Suites at Main Gate Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 1</h3></head><body><br>Don't stay here<p>This is the most disgusting hotel I've ever seen. I walked into my room and the smell of smoke was unbearable. However, it gets better. Not 1 role of tp. Not 1 towel, sheet, pillow, or blanket. I'm not kidding. It was just a mattress. In addition, it looks like a bunch of drugged out gangsters now live in these units. To top it off, I had to book another room that night. When I called Priceline to get reimbursed, they had to actually call this place. However, no one even answered. Honestly, I couldn't even make this up how bad it was.</p><br>Nellis suites<p>The worst hotel in Vegas do yourself a favor and stay somewhere else,makes circus circus look like a 5 star hotel.Will NEVER stay again.Rooms were horribly dirty and the beds,well dont get me started.... Guess you get what you pay for.</p><br>Terrible.<p>We have stayed at this hotel every year for several years for an event at the race track. This property is now catering to weeklies that are ruining the place up, badly. We pulled into the litter filled parking lot, noticed several people standing around smoking and drinking. I walked in the front desk area and two guys were hanging out in the lobby, a crackhead was standing in the lobby door asking me for a lighter through hand signals.

The grounds were strewn with trash and vomit, it was gross, and the people that are staying there are scary. The wifi was ridiculously slow, the tub took 15-20 minutes to drain after a shower, we were really disappointed how quickly this property has been ruined.</p><br>Rip-off Dump<p>Worst hotel I have ever stayed at. Everything is rundown and needs to go to the dump.I wanted to get close to the Nascar race track, but I sure payed the price for it.,.......Nellis Suites at Main Gate ...This place is in such a mess that it needs to be torn down. Do yourselves a favor and send someone out to inspect that dump, if you don't wish to believe me. The only thing this place has in it's favor is clean sheets and pillow cases each day on worn out beds. I could not even give it a rating, it is that bad. This is a perfect place for druggies. we were woke up several times during the 4 nights we stayed there by pot smokers and them firing off fireworks . The smell of POT was so thick you could cut it with a knife. I only wish now that I had checked out things more than I did ..... I should have know what to expect, when we pulled into the place, and a run down bar was at the main entrance. ............Do yourself a favor and do not, I repeat DO NOT GO TO >>> NELLIS SUITES AT THE MAIN GATE,<<<< in Las Vegas .NV.

NELLIS SUITES AT THE MAIN GATE,<<<< in Las Vegas .NV.....Will never ever get another dime from me. ...........Total Rip-OFF If Nellis Suites at Main Gate is an example of your motels / hotels, then you will never get another dime from me. what a dump.</p><br>Yuck<p>This place was pretty gross. Carpeting was ripped and stained. We needed maintenance to fix the shower head and drain. Room was dark, no pots to use in the room- only a couple of bowls, plates and utensils. Kitchen table broken, and the beds felt like sleeping on fabric covered plywood. We called it a double box spring.
The pool and hot tub were not open to guests due to a window being broken in the fitness room. ---made me wonder when that happened. I really just wanted to jump in the water after a long day.
It was very convenient in location because it was down the street from the raceway, but loud for our toddler' s nap time due to the Air Force flight drills from the base just adjacent to the hotel. -we did not choose this hotel, and we will not be going here again.</p><br>BUGS BUGS BUGS AND BAD BED<p>Never have I stayed in such a terrible hotel , this is a place where people live full time and shady characters frequent. Do I even go into the experience of the bug bites that I woke to . They allow pets so I guess I have to sleep in a dogs bed , oh the bed it was like they bought it from a thrift store and the sheets weren't even fitted , that tells me the management is to cheap to buy fitted ones, it took three attempts to have the dog eaten couch changed and the smoke detector is hanging by a wire . STAY AWAY FROM THIS DUMP!!!!!!!</p><br>Overpriced accommodations<p>We stayed at the Nellis Suites for one night only, as we got to Las Vegas a day earlier than the reservation we had at a hotel on the strip. Nellis Suites is actually in North Las Vegas, definitely away from the fun and energy of the boulevard. The room was overpriced, to reflect the fact that they knew that some big conference was making rooms scarce in the city. The room was dingy, the carpeting was stained, and the mattress was totally wasted and in need of replacement. On the positive side, there was a little microwave and small fridge setup, and actual dishes in the kitchenette area. Service was mediocre, and we particularly were offended having to pay an extra $5 at check-in (when the room was already booked and completely paid for online) for an "administration fee" Who's kidding whom? To add insult to injury, the girl insisted on making a paper photocopy of our credit card. Isn't this banned now?
Room Tip: Nellis Suites is there for a captive market - the nearly air field with family members that may want...

No breakfast was offered but there is a"pizza/beer joint" kinda on site with numerous restaurants within easy driving distance.</p><br>You get what you pay for<p>Cheap rates = old, outdated rooms. I'm active duty military and was on TDY orders at Nellis. Because there were no more available rooms at the hotels on base, I had to stay at Nellis Suties for one month. I picked this place because they had a full kitchen and I didn't want to eat out every night. They have no cookware, no oven mitts, no cutting knives, no dish washing liquid. The only had 2 plates, 2 cups, 2 spoons, 2 forks, 2 butter knives. The furniture is so outdated. The pictures on the website are so misleading. The one TV they had in the room was from the early 80s. Many of the basic channels were fuzzyThe couch had minimal support and you sink into it when you're sitting down. The bed collapsed in the middle. The walls were super thin. I could hear the water draining every time my upstairs neighbor took a shower. The towels were obviously cheap. The largest towel they had barely wraps around your body...and I'm short and thin. The AC is ridiculously loud. I had to buy earplugs just to sleep with the air on. This place is tolerable if you have a short stay. However, if you're staying for several days, weeks, or months, you may want to chose someplace else. Oh, and despite what the website says, they no longer offer free breakfast.

I think this place would do better if they updated their furniture, AC, TVs, and provided more cookware (at least one pot/pan).
Room Tip: A room towards the back of the hotel may be more quite, depending on how rowdy your neighbors are
