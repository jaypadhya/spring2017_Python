<html><head><h3>Nellis Suites at Main Gate Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 3</h3></head><body><br>Horrible place!!! Bad customer service!<p>Don't waste your money at this place. Rude employees with bad customer services. The place is very filthy and smelly. Very loud guest that stayed here. Everything doesn't work properly. Had to visit front desk often throughout stay. Will never return. Melissa and other employees had attitudes.</p><br>Not what the picture portray<p>Picture are deceiving, when the pics where taken for this site it had been cleaned and added pictures on the wall with flowers and plant, dish clothes decoration are only in the picture to enhance. BE certain this is not what you get upon the arrival of your stay. There are additional charges upon your arrival. Card was charge the full amount, however they informed that it was only charged for one night. There is a deposit of $50 if you do not charge your card, if paying in cash. The heater was so loud in the room we sleep in the second room for the remainder of the stay. Sink rusted along some other unsightly area in the bathroom. Keep Your Money!! add to it and get something better. Room service never came for the days we were there, we had to ask for pots they were missing.
Room Tip: Don't Stay Here! Best advice ever...
See more room tips</p><br>Terrible value<p>Currently staying here for 2 nights. Room rate $59 per night weekday. Have to pay $10 additional for internet service. Be warned, pass code only good for one person! Other than fact that you are literally right out the main gate, nothing else good here. Noisy heating unit all night. Drafty room. Called front desk to complain about internet which I was not warned about ahead of time, no phone in room. Beds uncomfortable. Dust bunnies the size of rabbits behind furniture in our room. Only a few strips of toilet paper left on roll in bathroom and sign in lobby they sell for $1 a roll. Definitely will never stay here again and recommend no one else do either! Oh, by the way, no refunds on anything if you are unhappy! Consider yourself warned!</p><br>Not Bad<p>**You get what you pay for with this hotel, the picture is definitely professionally done so the hotel doesnâ€™t look as nice and shiny as the picture. **

Pros: nice spacious rooms, kitchen, clean rooms, hotel security, small one person gym (its nice working out by yourself), the TV had a nice selection of channels, hot tub, spa, friendly staff (especially on the swing and night shift), fast maintenance

Cons: definitely not the best Internet connection, mixture of other hotel guests (military, construction workers, lower income, families, transients), have to pay for extra tissues and toilet paper, not enough kitchen ware, no TV in bedroom, not in the best area of town, not sure how often they clean the pool, loud AC unit (AC has to be constantly adjusted to get to the correct setting), no continental breakfast</p><br>Off the strip, good value<p>First of all. My tip to travelers is know what your paying for. This isn't a fancy strip resort with thousands of rooms and casinos. We stayed for a weekend and were Impressed at how efficiently the staff ran the place. There were groups of kids in town for a rave concert that's just miles down the road. The staff responds quickly to any guests requests and the check in was quick ( I've waited over 30 mins on the strip before). The only downside is their not on the strip and they have tube tvs. If that doesn't bother you great place to stay off the strip..</p><br>Horible place to stay<p>After staying here and looking at the reviews, I think they post their own reviews to boost their rating. They had a professional photographer take pictures and edit them to make the place look much nicer than it really is for their website and search engines.

The decor of the rooms is worn out, dirty, and very very dated. You are afraid to touch anything because you don't know whats been on it and everything is dingy.

The beds are lumpy. I would sleep on the floor but they are dirty and would afraid to do so.

The Air Conditioning (if it works) is very noisy and keeps you up at night. If you turn it off then the room gets very hot.

The daily cleaning staff (I think they only change the sheets) leaves bags of trash and laundry laying in the walkways so you have to walk around it.

The hallways are very hot because the Air Conditioners blow hot air in the walkways.

The continental breakfast is poorly stocked and you have to find it as they move it from place to place. I think they are trying to hide it from guests!

I will never stay here again. It's scary and they won't refund your money!
They do have a low cost. You can get similar rates at nice hotels for the same price if you sign up ahead of time for their email deals. Too bad I didn't know this before staying here!
Room Tip: Stay someplace else!!!
See more room tips</p><br>thank u drake and all the staff<p>after selling my home and waiting for my new home to be built and being retired Air Force i wanted a safe place for my wife and daughter, I could not have found a better place. It is located just outside the main gate of Nellis AFB, with 24 hour roaming security and the staff is some of the best I have seen. And Drake is an onsite manager who will do everything to make sure his guest are taken care of. the only downside is they stopped serving the continual breakfast every morning, but even with that Drake makes up for it with his attending to every detail of your stay. I just want to say thanks for a great stay.</p><br>Very Spacious and comfortable suites<p>We booked 2 bedroom suites and it was amazingly spacious, bed quality was good, nice to have kitchen also, front desk was helpful and prompt in service, 10-15 miles from strip, not very excellent location but didn't face any security issues. lot of 7-11 near by for quick grocery shopping</p><br>Right price,Right Room!<p>I booked this property for a great price! And I was skeptical about this place but once I saw the room I really enjoyed the room it was a double bed with a kitchen dinette! Didnt get the itchy feel on the bed now I can say the A/C is noisy ,but its a small price to pay. Now if the room was bad Im sure management would get a better room my was fine besides this is Vegas anyone who stays in the room all day shouldnt vacation I needed to go to the strip and just come back and crash now its not close to the strip need to travel little bit but for the price its worth it!
Room Tip: Check room if not satisfied can change rooms
See more room tips</p><br>Wanna be itchy?<p>Went to vegas on 4/6/2013 but upon checking into this room, im not kidding. There was something in the room that was making all of us itch. On the kitchen table, there was a dirty rag. The A/C was noisy. It smelled odd, and i cant put my finger on it. We were in the room NO more than 15 minutes and our group decided, IT was NOT for us.

The photos they have on their site are completely misleading. And it looks like im not the only who has said that. Nellis suites looks like they stayed in the 90s with the decor. The TV itself is an old style tube tv. Not even an LCD.

If you are looking for a inexpensive place to stay, DONT STAY HERE. Waste of TIME and MONEY! Oh, and get this NO refunds.

Sorry Nellis. Perhaps, revamping the entire facility and making them look decent will stop your bad reviews.</p><br></body></html>
