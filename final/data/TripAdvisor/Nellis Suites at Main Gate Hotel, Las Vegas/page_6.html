<html><head><h3>Nellis Suites at Main Gate Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 6</h3></head><body><br>Absolute dump. No refunds even if the room is unacceptable.<p>After signing a bunch of ridiculous forms, we inspected our room. It smelled badly enough to cause my wife to start sneezing. Also, the kitchen had NO cooking utensils, detergents or anything we would need to prepare a meal. It only contained a few bowls, cups and, get this, one spoon and 4 forks (no knives or anything else). We immediately left the room and asked for our money back. The staff did not offer me another room or any other options. NO REFUNDS. We left and went elsewhere. I even called the regional manager and she would not refund my money either. I feel like they STOLE MY MONEY. The property is also in a high crime area, as witnessed by the bums and 3-4 active police sirens we observed within a few minutes of the property. Overturned garbage can in the parking lot from the bar next door; describes the Nellis Suites well.</p><br>Cheap but dirty and run down<p>Not worth the cheap price. Rooms are dirty and old, with beaten up furniture and lousy "breakfast". If you don't care the price is cheap but the value is poor.</p><br>No complaints on a 2 month stay<p>This place was a God send. We were relocated to Nellis AFB in Sept, but, housing on base wouldn't be availiable for 2 months. So, after frantically calling every extended stay hotel in the area, I luckily found this place. They charged a minimal fee for pets, and the bedroom and living room area were separate...which is perfect if you don't usually go to bed at the same time as your 9 yr old. Sure, upon check in, I was a little disappointed. I expected something beautiful and grand. But, after being there for a while, I grew very comfortable with the place. The pool is wonderful, and we never had any problems with the room itself. The people are what make this place, though. Every single employee we encountered was amazing. From the front desk to the maintenance men and security guards...they are all just wonderfully sweet and helpful. I recommended the hotel to my parents who stayed in the area for 3 weeks, and they agreed with me. They couldn't say enough good things about the employees. I honestly think they are the nicest I've met out here on the West Coast. As for the area...yeah, it's not the best. But, when you've been in the military for a while...you come to realize..the areas around military bases are NEVER good areas. It was also kinda nice having so many military families around us. We met SO many who were in our situation (waiting for housing) and it was nice to have someone to relate to and for our daughter to play with at the pool. All in all, the perfect place for what we needed. Would I recommend it for a Vegas vacation? Probably not...it's pretty far from the strip (about 20 mins) and cabs are ridiculously expensive out here. If you're coming for the Speedway, this would be your hotel. It's the closest hotel (only about 5 mins away)
Room Tip: If you're going to be staying for an extended period of time, ask for one of the outer rooms on...

They have a cleaning service but they never get anything clean. The service is terrible. Hookers and drug dealers infest this place. Not a place to keep your family. My wife was robbed in the laundry room and the manager did nothing! I am sorry if you are getting stationed at Nellis. Las Vegas is one of the most depressing cities I have ever lived in. Check out the Las Vegas Police website and do a search of this area using their crime view tool ( http://www.lvmpd.com/). It will show you how infested this area is with robberies, drugs, and domestice violence. The club in front of Nellis suites was shut down from illegal activities within the last three years and re-opened. The same stuff probably still goes on. The police have zero control over this area and the city. STAY AWAY FOR YOUR OWN SAFETY! I would recommend the Hampton Inn on Cascade near Summerlin. A cheaper choice and they actually have a good complimentary breakfast. The Hampton Inn is also away from all the North Las Vegas ghetto idiots that jay walk in front of your car on Craig Rd.
Room Tip: Do not stay at this dump!

They said it was a non smoking room WRONG, I smoked that Muthafukah out just because they lied to me lol... It was worth every dime literally, that was first and last time ever non enjoying the funky Nellis... Just go ahead and tear it down already...</p><br>We enjoyed our stay! We'll stay there again<p>I booked this hotel based on the number of people in our family (5) and the rate. ($69 for Friday night stay). Included in the rate was full breakfast, internet, free parking and a pool. The suite had two bedrooms and living-room. A king size bed, and two double beds. There was exercise and laundry facilities available.

The pool was nice, warm and clean. open early and closed at 10 p.m.

The breakfast included frozen/toasted waffles, donuts, cereal, oatmeal, fruit, bagels and muffins.

Complimentary internet, but only for one computer.

The rooms were clean, but the beds were definitely very hard.
Staff was friendly and helpful.</p><br>Bad Attitude<p>The clerk who signed us in, David, was one of the rudest people I've had the misfortune to deal with. This man shouldn't be working with the public.</p><br>The worst service from a very RUDE employee<p>I checked into Nellis Suites for an overnight stay that was booked thru hotel club.com, I presented my reservation voucher to "David" the asst manager who told me I would be charged a non-refundable pet fee of $50/each (I had 2 dogs), I said why can't you just check the room in the morning before I leave so I can be refunded, he was very rude and said i could leave if I chose (forfeiting the full room fee I had paid for prior to arrival) he also told me he would call the police if I didn't pay or leave. I am a 55 yo Critical Care nurse on vacation with my family. This guys definitly lives by this quote.."Success is the ability to go from one failure to another with no loss of enthusiasm." Churchill.......he obviously hates his job!</p><br>If you're sensitive to noise and rude employees, this is NOT the place for you.<p>the rooms are actually okay. but just okay. beds are not comfortable. linens/towels are flimsy and cheap. everything in the kitchen worked but selection of cookware/dishes is so minimal. i'm glad i brought my own things to cook with.

the tv selection is insane! tons and tons of channels. fair internet connection.

the pool is okay but small. there were tons of kids here so it filled up quickly. the fitness center only has one treadmill and some weights so i had to wait everytime i wanted to use it. they really should have more than one piece of cardio equipment.

the staff was difficult and downright rude. everytime i had a question it turned into an exhausting experience. everything from internet questions to noise complaints to requesting a late checkout time ended in what seemed like almost an argument. i ended up switching hotels because i was so sick of their attitude.

i would say that you're any kind of sensitive person then don't stay here. not worth it. if you have thick skin and don't care, maybe it would it would be okay for you.
Room Tip: book through the internet for a cheaper price. they won't cut you a deal at the front desk.

The hotel and the rooms looked nothing like what they did in the website. On the website, the hotel looks modern, clean and well maintained. In realtiy, it is one of the dirtiest dumps i have ever been to. The front desk staff was incredibly rude. Check in took nearly thirty minutes as the staff could not find my reservation despite having called ahead of time to verify it. When I finally got to the room, it reeked of feces and urine. I later found out that a previous guest had brought two dogs with them. I was moved to another room. Here I found stains on bedding, no shampoo or conditioner, and inoperative fridge, and water which took 20 minutes to heat up. This was the worst stay of my life, for $45 I would rather have slept in my car!</p><br></body></html>
