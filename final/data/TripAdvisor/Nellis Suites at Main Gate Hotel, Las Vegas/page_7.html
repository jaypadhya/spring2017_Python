<html><head><h3>Nellis Suites at Main Gate Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 7</h3></head><body><br>A good choice if you have no standards.<p>My husband is active duty militiary and we have stayed in our fair share of hotels. Nellis Suites is by far the slummiest slum hotel I have ever had the misfortune of staying in. I checked in with my chldren and was given a room on the second floor. When I put my key in and opened the door my nose was assaulted with a very strong animal urine smell. Then I turned on the light and the room was not clean. I didn't even want to set my purse on the ground let alone my eight month old daughter. I marched back downstairs and requested a different room that animals had not occupied and that was clean. The next room she gave me smelled like a stale ashtray even though it was a "non smoking" room. The carpets were not clean. I went out and bought air freshners (20 dollars worth) and called the front desk to borrow a vaccum. I was told they didn't have access to one (it was only noon) and that all the maids had left for the day? Also although there is a full kitchen in my room the kitchen utensils are far beyond basic. They didn't even issue an oven mit or pot holders. My room has a dishwasher but lacks dishes or silverware. My last plea for anyone thinking of staying here with children would be don't! My 7 year old found a used condom on the floor in the bathroom right between the toilet and the bath tub. Had I not paid in advance and been refused a refund I would have left on the first day.
Room Tip: ****Don't stay here****

This is the ABSOLUTE CLOSEST HOTEL TO THE SPEEDWAY. EVERYONE AND THEIR BROTHER WANTED TO CRASH HERE WITH THEIR FRIENDS AND PARK HERE FOR FREE ON EVERYONE ELSE'S DIME. This hotel would have been a nightmare if the hotel hadn't kept their registration rules in place to make sure all the guests were respected and there was ample parking for the residents that paid!

The hotel has rules for a reason and that is to protect the guests. I felt respected, taken care of, and treated professionally as long as I respected the system. Yes, they require everyone to register and issue all the guests an ID card and parking passes for the cars. They have security at the front checking to make sure you have an ID issued and a car pass but this was completely for the guests protection. What I noticed was that there were no loud rooms overcrowded with unwanted guests. I saw about 50 drunk kids outside the hotel at 7am hanging outside the security gate because they weren't actual guests. Did i want those kids inside the hotel perimeters waking all of us up? No. I also saw a bunch of people trying to snag parking spaces with their friends so they could carpool to the speedway and or walk. Not cool if they weren't paying! The hotel only has so many parking spaces. If you want to carpool, meet at the 24 hour superwalmart around the corner, not at the hotel. This hotel is not structured as a place to party or visit with lots of friends. Its structured as a place to get some sleep with the party conveniently a mile away at the speedway!

The speedway actually is 1 mile away. The main entrance to the speedway for the June EDC event was on the side closest to the freeway which happened to be on the other side of the speedway. People are upset at the hotel. Be upset at the venue for the gate entrance they chose. Educate yourself a bit better before you just start walking to the destination. Don't be stupid. The entrance for artists was at a gate that was on the side of Nellis Suites so my entrance was a little over a mile.

I had seven rooms for my people and I must have made a hundred changes and the hotel staff was totally cool with it. I had people switching out in the rooms and just made sure to keep in communication with the front desk, registering everyone, and all was good. The staff is totally willing to work with you. They were even cool with an extra guest as long as they registered. The staff was always very helpful. Whenever I called the front desk for something they always came through with their commitment. The staff did an amazing job checking people in when I was in the office which was about 5 times in 2 days. The hotel was completely sold out so they did their absolute best to check people in as quickly as they could.

WHAT IS AMAZING: The free breakfast! Hot waffles, a selection of bagels, donuts, cereals, juices, cream cheese, lots of yumminess for a continental breakfast!! Free wireless! I used the wireless and had no problems. Just had to call the front desk for the code. The pool was super nice and a great place to meet up with fellow guests. The hotel was cool and let one of the rooms play music for the pool. They had parking for all guests even though it was packed! The rooms were super comfy and most importantly clean and well kept, & spacious. Plus the kitchen is a SUPER BONIS! Every room has a kitchen, fridge, microwave. Silverware and plates provided but do bring your own pot to cook in. There is nothing like being able to spend $50 at the grocery store (or SUPER WALMART around the corner) and be able to keep food for all of us for 3 days. We were able to keep a huge flat of water cold, plus fresh fruits and veggies, and ice cream in the middle of the summer! We didn't have to eat fast food all weekend and we were able to keep our costs down, especially since breakfast was provided.

I should remind everyone that this hotel is meant for an Extended Stay (weeks at a time). You can't expect luxurious accommodations here. You can't expect the shampoo, conditioner free samples. You can't expect the luxurious 4 star beds. THIS HOTEL IS AN INCREDIBLE VALUE FOR WHAT IT IS BUT DON'T EXPECT TO PAY A LOW RATE AND HAVE A 4 STAR EXPERIENCE. What you can expect is something very spacious and furnished like an apartment. Since its not on the strip and they are suites, we had a living room with a couch, chairs, and bedrooms. This was fantastic for all of us who had a couple of bags each loaded with costumes. A small room would have been a nightmare.

All in all, this hotel kept us close and out of traffic in and out of our event and we would DEFINITELY stay here again. We were all very thankful to the staff for working with us in a very strenuous time of a sold out hotel.

THIS IS A GREAT PLACE TO STAY IF YOU WANT TO BE RESPECTED AS A GUEST.</p><br>Terrible, rude service. More of a hassel than anything. DON'T STAY THERE.<p>My friends and I stayed here for an event that was taking place at the Motor Speedway and the website said it was 1 mile from the speedway and we were just delighted to find out the website lied, and that we actually had to make a 3.5 mile walk to the event.

Next, at check-in, they messed up our reservation (along with everyone elses' reservations who were checking-in around us). They made us pay for extra people in the room even though we had already stated the number of people we had 3 months ahead of time and called multiple times after to verify. But because I couldn't tell them the exact name of the person I talked to and the date I talked to them, they wouldn't do anything. Not even an apology for the inconvenience.

The people working the desk were all rude and entirely unhelpful. They made every single person staying into each room give their ID's for them to photocopy and they gave everyone cards that we had to show to a security guard every single time we entered the hotel, which was a pain.

They wouldn't give us more than 4 towels at a time, even though we paid to have 6 people in the suite. The ice machine was broken and it was triple digit heat all weekend. Security guards were patrolling the pool, constantly disrupting people and checking ID's to make sure people were actually staying at the hotel. "High speed internet access" is a joke. We couldn't even get a webpage to load for 45 minutes. They don't allow late checkout. The list goes on.

The website makes it look like the perfect place to stay, but don't be fooled. This place was way more of a hassel than anything else. It really put a damper on our entire trip.</p><br>Incredible Disaster<p>First off, upon arriving we were met with an impolite security guard (with a gun) saying "if you're going to check in, park there...and i better not see you go past that van!" Horrible first impression. Then as we check in, they made us file all this paper work and gave us red badges cards which we must carry at all times, otherwise they would not let us enter the premises. we asked for the third badge but said we had to pay extra for the third person (even though we reserved three people initially). Our trip was for an event at the Raceway, so we decided to have our friends meet at our hotel so we could take off...not a chance. They were so strict at this place. Beds were hard, no shampoo/soap and totally not worth it.
Other friends stayed next door at the Motel 8 and let me just say...better beds, better service and no strict rules.

one last thing to mention, at the nellis "suites" they don't allow a late check-out and they call us as 11:30 saying this, and i quote "we just wanted to see if you were going to check out or if you were going to pay for another day?"...wtf! already kicking me out! worst place i have ever stayed...PERIOD!
Room Tip: go next door to Super 8

A weekend at the raceway disaster<p>I called two months in advanced and made reservations at a set price, when we arrived the price misteriously had been raised, although I had confirmed 24hrs prior and was still quoted the same price, plus additional charge for the 3rd person when we were three in the reservation to begin with. On top after asking if there was late check out I was later told not available during my stay. When we got to our room the AC was broken and the room was at 98f , we were in pure heat for nearly an hour before maintanance arrived, then we asked the front desk for directions and we ended walking 3.5 miles through a highway road that took us thru the desert. In order to come in and out of the hotel u had to carry a red card and ur keys in order to come in and out u had to flash ur red card. the Room is still set in the 1980! Motel 6 would've been better, and the stinky attitude of the front desk completed this Hotel experience as the ultimated Hell Experience! My recommendation anything else around the area but Nellis Suites</p><br>Great Place to Start Your Relocation<p>I'm with the military and newly stationed at NAFB. In my relocation I used Nellis Suites as my family’s temporary home while we searched for permanent housing. The hotel is literally located across the street from the main entrance of the base and I found it clean, safe, and with friendly employees. I choose to book Nellis Suites weekly rate, which was very affordable seeing as I’m a Staff (the hotel does offer more expense daily rates). Upon checking into the hotel it was explained to me that due to this weekly rate the room would be cleaned and resupplied once a week. Again this was great for me. I just went to the local store and purchase any additional needs my family had instead of paying $50 to $100 dollars more at a less convenient hotel. The staff at the hotel was outstanding for our entire 45 day stay. They even helped me change my last two days at the hotel to a daily rate which worked out better for me. I should also mention the hotel included in my rate a continental breakfast for the entire family. This again helped me to better manage my budget.</p><br>Better off outside in a tent<p>Stayed here while looking for a house after relocating with the military. We had a two bedroom with sitting room and kitchen suite for my wife and two children. Houskeeping only came once a week so my wife would clean the room during the week. We were here for four terrible weeks that we paid for in advance. Two of the four weeks we had to go to the front desk to get additional towels because houskeeping only left us two sets. We also bought our own toilet paper since housekeeping only left one spare roll and never replaced it. When we found a house and moved in I went to check out with four days paid for still left. I was expecting a refund but when I went to check out I was informed that there was a no refund policy for early check out. I was never informed of this at time of check in and it is not listed in their terms and conditions on the web site when you make a reservation. You would be more comfortable and have better/cleaner conditions if you stay in a tent in a campgound for the money you spend.</p><br>Just say NO!<p>Nellis Suites had a lot of potential, especially for military families, but they not only dropped the ball, but declined to play. It could have been a great value, but it sorely needs updating and inclusion of basic items such as toiletries (e.g., shampoo, more than one roll of TP). It Some of the check-in procedures also made me concerned for the security of my vehicle, but that may be an unfair hit against this establishment. I've never had to fill out so much paperwork to check into such a low-brow place. Our room was apparently a pet friendly room, but no one mentioned that. The previous occupant apparently had a cat, and amazingly the housekeeping staff did not catch on to the overpowering scent of urine. Due to the "no room switching" policy I ignorantly signed at check-in, I was forced to get creative with extra towels and large quantities of Lysol.

What a dump. Never again, and I will warn all friends away.</p><br></body></html>
