<html><head><h3>Fairfield Inn & Suites Las Vegas South Hotel Reviews Page 9</h3></head><body><br>Near The Strip. Got Everything Covered<p>Nice hotel to stay as it's near The Strip. You can take the Hotel Shuttle or public buses going to the strip. Room's clean and big enough to move around. Breakfast has a fairly good selection. It would be a good idea though to lengthen the breakfast hours (for people who will wake up late from exploring Vegas).</p><br>Close enough to the strip, worth the shuttle trip<p>This Fairfield Inn is less than a mile off the strip, which made it very convenient for riding the shuttle back and forth to our main destinations (except there was road construction, but still not too bad). We stayed Friday afternoon through Sunday morning. There were 4 girls in 2 rooms which was perfect. There was enough room to move around in the room, though the closet door blocked off one side of the bed when it was open. The bathroom was clean, no lotion was provided in the room, but I'm sure we could have called to get some. The basic amenities were there--TV, phone and desk, we didn't need to use the Wi-Fi. The breakfast in the morning was more than adequate, sometimes you would have to wait a few minutes for them to restock the yogurt flavors or brew more coffee. Mostly, everything was available and tasted great for the morning fuel before hitting the strip. Its close proximity to the freeway made it easy to find the hotel on our trip in and navigating to the mall which was close by fairly easy as well. If you are looking for a clean, reasonably priced place to sleep (or at least shower) and eat free breakfast before hitting the strip, this is a good deal!
Room Tip: Rooms on the west side of the hotel are farther away from the freeway...we were on the fourth floor...

The room had a king sized bed and a pull out couch that was so close to the wall, when pulled out it made it almost impossible to get around when trying to use restroom. We thought it, the other room with bed in it would have door. Wrong there too. No privacy. The breakfast was sparse but the boys enjoyed making their own waffles.</p><br>Nice place and convenient to Strip!<p>We stayed here over a weekend (Saturday and Sunday night stays) to avoid the high rates at the hotels on the Strip. They have a shuttle that takes you to the strip, but we used our rental car. It is easy to access the interstates and the Strip from this hotel. Mandalay Bay is the closest Strip hotel. It is an easy drive from the airport.

The hotel was clean and the breakfast was nice. They kept all the food stocked and we enjoyed the Jimmy Dean sausage biscuits. It was a typical Fairfield Inn. The check-in was fast, the front desk staff was very nice and the rates were reasonable. It's also reasonable for using Marriott points as well. We would consider staying here again.</p><br>Good Alternative To The Strip<p>Was looking for a decent hotel that was near the strip and found this Fairfield Inn which is located right across I-15 from the Southern end of Las Vegas Blvd near the Mandalay Bay Hotel. Very reasonable rates, has all the amenities and I found the front desk staff to be extremely helpful. This would be an excellent choice for you if you want to avoid the crowds and street traffic.
Room Tip: A few rooms look out at the I-15 freeway, so ask for one that faces onto the front or back parking l...

I was greeted by Ryan who was very pleasant and courteous. He gave me my keys quickly and checked me in and gave me information for breakfast and a shuttle schedule. I went up to my room and found it to be very average but definitely clean. The bed was comfortable but not overly so. Towels were definitely small and skimpy but worked. Pantene shampoo and conditioner. Breakfast buffet was staffed by a very lovely lady who was working very hard to make sure that the food was replenished and asked guests if they needed anything. I was very happy with my muffins and assortment of bagels etc. Check out was a breeze and staff actually acted like they cared. I would recommend this hotel for a quick stay for sure. Cab fare was $20 dollars from the airport and you can also take a 9 dollar shuttle.</p><br>Frumpy and old<p>We were disappointed with our stay. The bed in our room was ancient and the room decor was like staying at Grandmas. The toilet ran all night and the hotel was extremely noisy with slamming door, the freeway outside our window and plaines flying overhead. We also asked for a king size bed and received two queens.
Room Tip: I would ask for a room away from the freeway and farther from the planes taking off.

Hotel provides free hourly transportation to and from the Strip (New York-New York). Reasonable room rates. Breakfast disappointing.</p><br>comfy bed, nice pillows, good breakfast, and convenient shuttle service<p>Located close to the Mandalay Bay centre and the Vegas strip, this hotel is newer, does not smell of smoke, has nice mattresses and pillows, good housekeeping, ad the breakfast has nice waffles, yogurt, breads, cereals, some fruit, and a nice assortment of hot and cold beverages.
The rooms are not very big, but the tv was nice and worked well, and the WiFi worked nicely all the time. The water pressure was good and the shower head had 5 settings on it. The heating system was not too noisy.
The hotel shuttle went to two locations on the strip for free plus a free trip to the airport. The staff was very friendly and corteous. Check-in was quick.
We had a very comfortable stay here.
Room Tip: North side rooms would be noisier because of the traffic across the freeway to the strip. South side...
See more room tips</p><br>Showing it's age<p>We have stayed at one of the 3 Marriott hotels on Dean Martin Drive since they opened. We typically only stay one night while driving through. It is a great location for this because the hotels are easy to get to from the freeway so you don't have to deal with the strip (but still close enough to get to with their hotel shuttle van). On our most recent visit a few weeks ago I was disappointed in the state of the hotel. I am sure the management knows by now, the the hotel is looking older. The carpet in the hallway was frayed and stained. The room was clean but the furitnure was worn. Although this is not half as bad as the FFI near the airport, this hotel certainly needs some work to be up to Marriott standard.</p><br></body></html>
