However, the hotel offers complimentary drop every hour to the Mandalay Bay Hotel and MGM Grand, making it easily accessible. The staff is also very friendly and helpful. Good place to stay over the weekend when the Strip hotels are really pricey.</p><br>Nice, clean but not a great location.<p>I stayed here one night for a conference at the Mandolay Bay Convention Center. When I called the hotel prior to booking I was told I could easily walk to the convention center, less than a quarter mile walk. In fact you can see the convention center from the hotel, and it seems close, and there are sidewalks. But walking is very hazardous, crossing busy highways with lots of traffic. I would not recommend walking. The hotel does have a shuttle though that runs frequently and is convenient. Otherwise I had a great stay here. Staff are very friendly and helpful, rooms are spacious and clean, and the hotel is very quiet and relaxing (especially compared to somewhere like the Luxor, which is very congested! I would recommend this hotel, but plan to use the shuttle. The exercise room iis small but worked for me.</p><br>nice place to stay off strip with family<p>My elder parents, my son and sister stayed in one room at this Fairfield, which is next to residence and courtyard mariott. For the price, it can't be beat, as long as you have car (a must under hot summer weather). Driving to strip only less than 3 miles. Breakfast is meh, but hey, it's free, and holds me up until lunch. Love this place, great choice for for off-strip with family.</p><br>Clean, quiet and convenient<p>I stayed here during a convention and was very happy with my room and the overall quality of the property.
Great value for the money and included free breakfast and a shuttle service to the Strip and Airport. I would definitely stay here again- a great alternative to the Mega Casino Hotels on the strip for someone who has no interest in gambling etc.
Highly recommended.</p><br>Nice hotel, reasonable price<p>One night stay here before our flight home. Had a mini suite and it was a very nice room for the price. Two TV's, micro, fridge. Short drive to airport and front desk staff very helpful. Would gladly stay again.</p><br>Amazing STAFF and GREAT BEDS!<p>I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights for a girls weekend getaway. We had a great rate for a room that wasn't necessarily the most spacious room, but considering we came to Las Vegas to go out to the strip most of the day/night, we didn't mind. My favorite thing about this hotel are the EXCEPTIONAL front desk agents (Ryan, Korina, and Jeff!!!) They were each sooo helpful and sooo welcoming. Ryan checked us in and was very laid back and genuine (not over the top friendly/fake how some front desk agents can be). Korina was very helpful and sweet when we needed to add an additional room for some friends. She made sure the check in process would go smoothly for our friends and she even was able to get our rooms close to each other. One night after a long night of clubbing, we got back at around 5am and Jeff the night auditor was sooo funnny and friendly to us even though we all must have looked like a hot mess. He even sent up some muffins to our room even though the COMPLIMENTARY BREAKFAST hadn't even started yet. Overall this trip was just perfect and especially beacause of the staff and COMFY beds at the Fairfield Inn and Suites Las Vegas. Thanks again for a pleasurable stay. I've stayed at this hotel a few times now and I know I will be back soon!</p><br>Another Great Stay at a Fairfield Inn<p>I spent one night at the hotel and it was as always excellent. This is my 3rd or 4th stay at this location and I have never been let down. The check in service was exceptional, the front desk employee made me feel really welcome. The room was spacious and clean and the complementary breakfast was also very nice. I would always recommend this hotel to anyone who did not want to stay right on the strip.</p><br>Worst night of sleep I ever had!<p>We stayed here on our way home from Disneyland to break up the drive. We booked this hotel because we didn't want to stay on the strip. The location was good and easy to find. When we first arrived, we were told that they had no sofa beds so we had to switch our king room, for 2 queens so my kids had somewhere to sleep.
When we walked in the room, my first impression was that it smelled very clean. The room was a little cramped but not too bad.
We had wanted to get some dinner so when I called down to the front desk to ask about nearby restaurants, the woman, Maggie, was kind of short with me with her answers. It turns out the closest restaurant was in the Marriott next door. My husband drove around to find something else and there was nothing.
He came back and we decided to get something delivered. I called down again and Maggie acted so annoyed with my questions. I pretty much just asked her if she had eaten from a certain place.
Going to bed, the beds seemed okay but sometime in the night, the sheets had come up from the corners. I had to get out of bed and pull them back down.
It almost seemed as if they weren't big enough for the bed.
Also, you could hear everything in our room. We could even hear the people above us just walking around. And for some reason, they were up all night and we could hear everything. We could also hear a lot of noises from the room next door.
Needless to say, we got no sleep and it was the worst night at a hotel we have ever had.
The breakfast was pretty good. Plenty of things to chose from and the lobby and breakfast are were kept nice.
We ended up leaving something at the hotel and when we called about it, they said they didn't have it. So, either another guest found it or one of the housekeepers kids is very happy!!
Overall, I would not recommend this hotel especially to people traveling with kids and to people who like to sleep.</p><br>Wonderful stay!!!<p>My husband and I stayed at this property in January and we enjoyed it a lot! The complimentary shuttles to the strip and free breakfast really made things easier for us and saved us a lot of money. The room is a little small but no big deal. Upon check in, the Asian lady (Maggy or Megan) was very friendly and knowledgeable, provided us with a lot of suggestions on food and places to go. We will definitely stay there again!</p><br>Stayed every other week for over a year... felt like a second home<p>Stayed at this hotel for multiple nights every other week over a year. The staff made me feel like a member of the family. Great rooms, updated & clean</p><br></body></html>
