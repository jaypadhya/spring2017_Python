<html><head><h3>Fairfield Inn & Suites Las Vegas South Hotel Reviews Page 1</h3></head><body><br>Friendly helpful front desk staff, nice room, hotel undergoing renovation<p>My husband and I stayed here for 3 nights on vacation trip. Close to airport, close to strip and I-15, we have stayed in the other hotels in the area and really enjoyed this one. Super friendly front desk staff, breakfast buffet was adequate, nice 1 bed suite room, with nice shower. Our only issue was with the bed, which was a King per hotel, but was so narrow that we had trouble sleeping on it without almost falling out of bed.
Can get drinks and snacks from the Market in the hotel or go to the Courtyard next door to the restaurant there and get food to-go or eat at the Courtyard. We would definitely stay here again. Whole hotel is being renovated, so should be even better next time.
Room Tip: little construction noise at times, some airport noise, but not noisy majority of time

For an above average price, I thought this property was average at best. After having to return to the front desk because my key card would not work, I did find my room to be clean and nicely furnished. But walls between rooms must be thin because I could hear the conversation of the guests next door as if they were in my room. And surprisingly, the room did not have a refrigerator. In my experience, refrigerators are standard even in much lesser hotel chains. And in Las Vegas, a refrigerator is a basic necessity. Breakfast was standard fare and offered in a rather cramped area off the lobby. The pool area is uninviting and without shade. The location gives limited options for getting a bite to eat without shuttling to the Strip. Better off-Strip accommodations at better prices and locations are certainly available.</p><br>Business trip to Vegas<p>I was in need for a place that was affordable and close to the Strip. This property is ideal and affordable. Breakfast is good and plentiful. The shuttle is available all day until 01:00 at no cost. Transportation to the airport also at no cost. No transportation from the airport to the hotel though. $30 cab ride. Very clean rooms and under renovations on the fourth floor at the time of my stay.

I highly recommend this hotel!

Merci.
Room Tip: Very helpful staff and extremely knowledgeable!

It has easy access for cars and a free shuttle to the Mandalay Bay resort every 30 minutes and to the Aria Hotel & Casino every hour. It also has a free shuttle to the airport. The rooms are immaculate and very comfortable. We had a 'mini' suite which was perfect. Has a coffee maker, two tvs, free wifi, microwave, and a mini refrigerator. They have free coffee and tea in the lobby. Ilena was the person we dealt with mostly during check-in and the day. She was a delight. Very friendly and gave us great directions and advice. The rooms were furnished adequately and the bed was comfortable. Very quiet. A great place to stay and a great value.
Room Tip: I think they are all good. We were on the second floor.

Thank you for making our Anniversary an amazing one!!!</p><br>Good clean place to lay your head in Vegas<p>We booked a night here after our flight got in much later than expected (11:30pm from east coast) and we were exhausted and had a 5 hour drive ahead of us. I was so glad we did. The room was clean, quiet and provided everything we needed for our upcoming roadtrip: a complimentary hot breakfast, ice machine to fill our cooler in the morning and a little place to buy drinks and snacks before you leave. So much easier than staying on the strip and lugging all of our stuff around. Definitely would stay again.</p><br>Very average<p>this is one of the 3 marriots that are next to each other. Free shuttle serving the 3 marriots like 1 am in the night. Breakfast is very average - so are the rooms...its like 2 miles off the strip so mind it...

i feel there are better places to stay off the strip than this one..expect for the free shuttle.</p><br>The Worst<p>I've been a Marriott rewards member for over 10 years and I have never had a problem with any of my stays. This hotel was the worst!!!! I waited for an hour in the lobby with 20 other people because they didn't have our rooms ready even though they have a 3:00 guarantee policy. I asked to speak to the manager and was told that he was already with someone. Several issues once I got in the room that fell on deaf ears. I will never stay here again and I would not recommend.</p><br>Not bad, but due for a refresh<p>Booked two nights for attending the Retail Market, only stayed one. Although the room was reasonably clean, this property does not reflect the pristine condition I have come to expect from Marriott properties. The carpets were stained, the upholstered furniture was dingy and stained, the beds were sloppily made, and everything had a worn out look.
It was a reasonably good value and I was happy to avoid the strip, but I will not book here again until they do a refresh.
Note, the breakfast was a little better than average and the staff were very friendly and helpful.
Room Tip: East end of the building next to busy street and closer to the airport, west end is probably a bit q...
See more room tips</p><br>my review after nearly 4 weeks here<p>Carpet was so loose one could easily trip on the ripples, I was unsuccessful at a following day room change out, so I am stuck with the current situation. Ice machine on 2nd and 3rd floors inoperative, copier at biz center out of order and the whirlpool has been lukewarm to ambient outdoor temps. One would think, that after nearly a month, I could get a room change out? Guess not</p><br></body></html>
