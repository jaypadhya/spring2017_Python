<html><head><h3>Fairfield Inn & Suites Las Vegas South Hotel Reviews Page 3</h3></head><body><br>clean and good location<p>Perfect hotel for overnight. fair and reasonable.
Nice and quiet location and easy access to I-15 (to Zion or Death Valley)

Easy parking and free shuttle to the strip. And free breakfast and wifi.
Can't ask anymore for $100 or less.</p><br>Great location<p>I was in town for the week on business and wanted to avoid the strip. This Fairfield Inn was the perfect location. You can see the strip from the hotel but don't have to get caught up in the activities. The staff was very friendly. Food is what you would expect from a Fairfield, enough options for anyone to find something for breakfast. In addition, the hotel was clean and well maintained.</p><br>Overnight Stay<p>Stayed one night prior to early morning flight out of McCarran. Smooth and fast check in. Very nice and friendly reception staff. Room was clean and quiet. Used restaurant at sister property adjacent to hotel, which was adequate.
Free shuttle to terminal in the morning and free wi-fi. Would stay there again.</p><br>You Don't Have To Stay On The Strip<p>Look. They have a shuttle that will take you to one of the hotels at the beginning of the strip to start your Las Vegas journey. If you are renting a car, most hotels have free parking. I park at this lot on the strip next to Polo Towers which is right in the middle of the strip for $5.00 all day. Get out, enjoy the strip and motor back to Fairfield. The breakfast is always a plus at the property and the folks that work their were very nice too. When it's time to go home, the airport is literally ( well, almost) right across the street! The price is right. Can't go wrong.
Room Tip: I stick to what I like, which is top floor, not next to elevators or ice machines please

Being a Marriott Gold member do have additional benefits. We were allowed late check-in as we missed our flight to Vegas due to snow storm in Midwest and they also made arrangement for one of my guest to stay in the room, who arrived early. The room was nice and clean with all amenities. Breakfast was good and they have 24 hrs coffee at the lobby. Also free shuttle service is provided to the strip hotel ( Mandalay Inn and New York-New York ). If any one wants to stay at a peaceful location in Vegas and also be near to all the action this hotel is a good option. There is a Walmart super-center near by and you also have good options for Lunch & Dinner.
Only one stuff missing was a Microwave, which would help a family with kids.
Room Tip: Higher Floors will be silent.

Room Tip: The rooms on the West side of building away from highway 15.

Came to Las Vegas on a cross country trip via Amtrak trains ( Biggest Mistake Ever) Booked trip to Las Vegas Neveda Amtrak sent us to Las Vegas New Mexico never Knew this town exsisted. To make along horrible story short. We were hours late arriving in Vegas transported by an Amtrak shuttle due to their mistake to Las Vegas from Arizona. We were dropped off at the Airport and had to pay for a shuttle to our hotel Circus Circus. Another disaster I will review. Spent one night there to be close to family. Amtrak lost our luggage so all we had was the clothes we were wearing. I had originally made a reservation with Fairfield Inn but, family were complaining to far from them and the strip.. I went with my feelings regardless the distance because of the way i was treated so wondertfully in Fairfield Inn Verona, New York. Was I glad I did . We were greeted by Elena who was so wondertful. We explained to her of our bad trip on Amtrak etc. She said Im so sorry to hear that. Lets see what we could do for you. Check in was at 3pm we were there at the hotel 11am she said how would you like an upgrade to a suite we already had a reservation for a King room. We said sure she said it wont be ready for a couple of hours but, you can go on our complimentary shuttle to the strip to enjoy yourselves when you return you suite will be ready. My husband and I did that and when we returned our beautiful clean modern suite was ready.Jerry also at the front desk was also so helpful calling a cab for us one night offering his assistance whenever needed. Hosekeeping staff very kind and courteous.Complimentary shuttle drivers the same. Breakfast was very good also mant items to choose from nice hot breakfast. I have stayed at 2 Fairfield Inns and the way we have been treated in 2014 .We will only stay with Fairfield Inn from now on. Thank you Fairfield Inn for making a wonderful vacation after our horrible time on Amtrak.</p><br>Good Place for a quick overnight stay<p>We stopped here for one night, just to get some sleep. It took a while to get checked into a room, as there was only one clerk at the front desk. However, the room was comfortable and the price was reasonable. The front desk clerk was not very helpful with suggestions for dinner. We asked for suggestions for a place where we could get "dressed up", and she suggested In and Out Burger. We ended up at a Chili's restaurant a few miles away. (We didn't want to deal with going to the Vegas Strip.). All in all, it was your basic off the highway overnight stay.</p><br>Avoiding the hubbub<p>We were just passing through and had a very early flight out and decided to stay near the airport. The Fairfield was a great option. Staff was very friendly and courteous, even at 3 am the next morning.
Rooms are quiet and very clean.</p><br>excellent in every way<p>Due to overbooking i had to stay an extra night in Vegas, so i was advised to call a service number for "stranded passengers". They made a reservation for the Fairfield Inn. My mindset was to go home an although i had strong reservations about my stay, the situation changed the moment the very friendly driver of their complementary shuttle service arrived. Immediately my mood changed from dark to sunny, very helpful and with a nice conversation he drove me quickly and safe to the hotel and at the reception the service was again very welcoming and pleasant. Even though i was ready to go home, my excellent stay at the Fairfield Inn made it far from a punishment. The hotel is situated quietly 1 block away from the strip, no slotmachines or other loud machines, perfect! Next time when i'm in Vegas, the Fairfield will be my temporary home while in Sin City
Room Tip: As a smoker in a non-smoking hotel i asked for a room close to the exit and that was great, but undo...
