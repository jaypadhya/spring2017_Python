<html><head><h3>Fairfield Inn & Suites Las Vegas South Hotel Reviews Page 13</h3></head><body><br>Outstanding Hotel<p>My boyfriend & I were attending a wedding in Vegas. All of the hotels were pretty expensive for the weekend we were going. Of course we wanted to stay on the strip but because of the prices we decided to stay at the Fairfield Marriott. My boyfriend & have "HIGH" standards anywhere we stay & try to get the best value for our $$. Our reservations were for the entire stay of our trip, but a few days before we left we found cheaper rates at The Excalibur so we canceled all but the 1st night. We did our research & found that the hotel was still very new. When we arrived it was better than we even imagined. It was still very close to the strip & we see all the hotels lit up. The lobby was very clean as well as the grounds around the hotel. The room was spectacular. It was like a mini apt. Everything was clean & in great condition. We stayed in a King room, the front of the room was a little living room w/a hideaway sofa, TV. & even a stereo complete w/cd & cassette. The bed, linens & pillows were "VERY" comfortable. Almost better than my own. There was also a 2nd TV in the area w/the bed. I was very upset that we canceled our other days & was sad to go. This place was so much better than the Excalibur. The only downfall is its not on the strip & there are no slot machines here, but were big gamblers. But none of that mattered. The staff was very friendly & we were greeted each time we came in. I plan to stay here every time I'm in Vegas & would recommend it to everyone. We were so impressed.</p><br>Nice Hotel<p>This hotel is only about a year old, it is very nice for a Fairfield. The lobby, and room decor are exceptional for a hotel of this class. We stayed in a suite with 2 double beds, it had a rather large bathroom, a nice seperate sitting area with pull out sofa, TV, stereo, desk and 2 chairs. The room is long and thin, but nicely arranged. Breakfast is included in the morning from 6am-10am and includes hot and cold cereals, all kinds of breakfast breads and pastries, fruit, waffels, juice, milk, yogurt etc., it was very good. Lobby staff ok never acknowledge you coming or going, had trouble finding our reservation in the computer too, not the friendliest people. You can hear airplanes here and there. The only real problem at this hotel is that the rooms get very warm unless you keep the air conditioning on (we were there in Jan. it was in the 40's at night), I can't imagine how bad it gets in the summer! The air conditioner is wall controlled and VERY noisy, we would set it low when we would leave the room and always found it back at 76 when we returned! Even with the air on only the bed area really cooled, the living room area where the pull out was stayed pretty warm! They have non-smoking rooms which was nice. The other problem I had was with the staff. When we left the hotel in the morning my daughter left her doll in the room, we know this because we walked straight from the room to the car. We didn't realize the doll was left until we were already on our way. I called the hotel and asked that they go get the doll so a friend could pick it up, I was told to call back. When I called back I was told they could not find the doll. I really don't think anyone looked, I even told them when they would find the doll. It would have just taken a minute to go up to the room and look. My daughter is still upset! Next time i'd drive back and look myself! Just don't leave anything behind and you'll be ok!</p><br>Great stop, excellent service and breakfast<p>For those who are traveling through Las Vegas to other destinations and do not want to stand in lines or be inconvenienced by the gambling atmosphere. This is a great choice to stay it is right off the freeway and easy to access with out traffic issues. The FairField Inn is a new building and very accommodating in the way of service and room layout.
Fairfield Inn was a great stay for us on the way to California. In conclusion, I posted this comment to let others know of this hotel, since when I researched this hotel there were no comments. The only thing that I would consider an inconvenience is you can here planes fly over the hotel from time to time.</p><br>Perfekte Übernachtung in Las Vegas<p>Sehr ruhige Lage, ca 3 Meilen vom Mandela Hotel entfernt, zu dem auch ein kostenloser Shuttle fährt (Trinkgeld für den Fahrer ist aber erwünscht), alle 30 Minuten, ca 10 Minuten Fahrzeit. Genauso wird man auch wieder abgeholt. Unser Zimmer / Bad war sehr geräumig, ansprechend und modern möbliert. Es gibt keine Spielhalle im Hotel. Sehr schnelles WiFi, kein Kühlschrank, keine Microwelle. Frühstück war sehr umfangreich und lies keine Wünsche offen, der Orangensaft schmeckte hier mal ausgezeichnet und der Kaffee war ordentlich stark, zusätzlich gab es noch Obstsalat. Preis- Leistungsverhältnis war ausgezeichnet. Wir haben unseren Aufenthalt jedenfalls sehr genossen und würden jederzeit wieder hier buchen.</p><br>TUTTO OK<p>Ho soggiornato una notte. L'hotel è pulito, tranquillo, fuori dal caos della strip. Raggiungibile il centro con la loro navetta gratuita ogni mezz'ora. Personale cordiale e disponibile. Colazione inclusa.</p><br>Bem localizado e calmo.<p>フロントデスクの女性は可もなく不可もなくという印象でした。私がチェックインしたときはフロントに一人しかおらず、苦情を受けたり電話応対したり、チェックインをしている間にとても忙しそうでした。もう一人いたほうがいいのになと思いました。
部屋は無駄なものがなくきれいで静かな環境にありよかったです。ストリップもダウンタウンも騒がしくて寝づらいところがありますので。疲れていたので、ルームサービスを頼みたかったのですが、ルームサービスの案内が部屋になく、不便に感じました。
場所はストリップから近いものの、車がないと歩いてはストリップまで行けないので、レンタカーを利用する方には良いかもしれません。シャトルバスも出ているようでしたが、利用しなかったので詳細はわかりません。朝食も宿泊料に含まれていましたが、時間の都合で利用できず残念でした。マリオットブランドのホテルという安心感もあります。</p><br>Necessita renovar<p>O hotel fica a menos de 10 minutos do aeroporto de Las Vegas e é bem perto do início da STRIP. Uma grande vantagem é que, por não estar na STRIP, o hotel é muito calmo e permite um bom descanso após um dia de Las Vegas. Tem café da manhã e estacionamento grátis e os quartos são excelentes.
Room Tip: Qualquer um é bom
See more room tips</p><br>Recomendo, Muito Bom !<p>Ja esta precisando renovacao. Primeiro quarto com moveis manchados, nao foi feita arrumacao no primeiro dia. Decepcao chegar e ver o quarto sem limpeza, sem toalhas novas. Hospedes muito barulhentos por duas noites, seguranca nao deu jeito. Pedi para mudar de quarto e ai sim valeu o customer service da funcionaria Cynthia que nos deu um upgrade para uma suite e o no fim nao foi resultado tao negativo. Gosto muito da rede Fairfield Inn mas este embora bem localizado esta caro em comparacao a outros que fiquei.</p><br>Recomendo.<p>Se você quer ir a Vegas e quer um lugar tranquilo para descansar depois dos passeios pela Strip, este hotel eu recomendo. Morei em Vegas por 2 meses e conheci um pouco dos Hoteis cassinos. Não tenho nada contra ficar em Hotel Cassino, mas se você NÃO estiver disposto a ter surpresas (limpeza dos quartos, cheiro de cigarro, bebados, sujeira nos corredores) recomendo os Hoteis da Marriott. Este fica a 4 minutos da Strip de carro, é muito limpo, bom café da manha e excelente custo beneficio.</p><br></body></html>
