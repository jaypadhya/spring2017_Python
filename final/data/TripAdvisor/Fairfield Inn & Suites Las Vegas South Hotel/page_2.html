<html><head><h3>Fairfield Inn & Suites Las Vegas South Hotel Reviews Page 2</h3></head><body><br>Hidden gem close to the strip<p>Hotel is very clean. Room was much larger than expected so that was a pleasant surprise! There is a bedroom and a separate TV area off of the bedroom. Bathroom was very large with nice counter space. There is a shuttle that runs to Mandalay Bay every 30 minutes and a shuttle to Aria every hour. Shuttle is clean, efficient and drivers were always very friendly. Breakfast was good, nice selection of cold and hot food. Coffee maker in room which is a bonus considering the hotels on the strip do not have coffee makers. Also, no resort fee here which is standard for strip hotels. I would definitely stay here again!</p><br>Comfy and convenient<p>Husband and I took a short trip to Vegas but didn't want to be right on the strip. He had some Marriott points from his travels thru work, so we decided on this hotel. Staff is very welcoming and helpful. Breakfast was a plus and filling. Hotel is one street behind the strip. They have shuttles over to the strip which made it great!! Would definitely recommend this place!</p><br>Good off strip hotel<p>I enjoyed my stay at this hotel. Michelle at the front desk acknowledged my Gold status and was very welcoming when I checked in. The hotel is very clean and other staff members were also friendly. My room was a suite and the bathroom was very large and also clean. The decor would be nicer if it the rooms were updated a bit with the more modern look of some of the newer Fairfield Inns, but it was fine for a weekend. There is a small gym and pool on the property. They have a shuttle to the airport but they do not pick up there for some reason. There is a shuttle to the strip as well. Breakfast was fine with both hot and cold choices. The breakfast area was clean and kept stocked up. There is a business center with two computers. You do hear a little airport noise here, but it was not too bad. I found this hotel quiet which I appreciated. I don't like staying on the strip and I would definitely stay here again.</p><br>Great hotel/ great location<p>This is the perfect hotel to stay at if you like to be close to the strip but don't like all of the traffic on the strip. You can see the strip from the hotel and the have free shuttles that run hourly to the Mandalay Bay and Aria. The front desk people were very friendly and all around this hotel was wonderful</p><br>Great Hotel and Staff....<p>We arrive around 5pm on Friday the 19th of June....Was greeted by the front desk staff and was giving a very warm welcome...Checkin was a easy and the front desk staff was truly very professional...Our Room was super clean and very very comfortable. The price of our rooms for three days was outstanding. The van to the Vegas Strip was easy and ontime and driver was very friendly and very helpful....the van was very clean. Very close to the Vegas strip and I drove many time to and from the hotel to the Bellagio and found it very easy to get back to the hotel. Also own about 30 minutes drive to Hoover Dam from the Hotel....This is also our crew hotel and I have always enjoy coming to this hotel on layover.....
Room Tip: Easy on and off Hwy 15 and to the Strip....Plus free Parking.....and Van service to the Vegas Strip...

The shuttle runs every 30 mins, from early morning until quite late at night. So you should be covered for most of your day in Vegas.
The rooms are big enough, comfortable and should give you a very good night rest.
The breakfast is fairly average and don't expect much from it.
Overall, it's a quaint hotel with very friendly & helpful staff, which offers a good value for the price without all the noise of hotels on the strip.
Room Tip: Ask for a room with a view of the LV strip

Thi sis one of the busiest in the entire Las Vegas. When they talk of Convention center, other than Las Vegas- this is next famous in that town. Fairfield Inn is pretty close or rather opposite to where Mandalay .. Their rates are highly reasonable compared to other properties. They have a shuttle and what not ... They have a free Breakfast. People worth mentioning is Tera L. Barr, General Manager - sincere, honest, and fair to customers. She is highly objective and if there are issues ..she takes it real serious to resolve. Truly exceptional from Hospitality industry perspective. There are few more..it has been a while a month have gone:) totally forgot their names.
Room Tip: Reach out to Tera L. Barr, General Manager she can help get the right side of the bild
See more room tips</p><br>I expected better customer service for a Marriott<p>Upon arriving two the airport aside from asking for a good shuttle company ( which I was misinformed about) I asked what were the chances of me checking in, she said they wasn’t a room available at the time but there should be one once I arrived to the hotel. When I came to the desk to check in Richard at the counter let me know my room was not ready but if I wanted the accessible (handicapped) room I could have it, I told him I would wait. My wait was two hours long. I understand I was early but what happened to the early arrival request I made when I called? If a guest is sitting in your lobby ready to check in, what’s it cost to ask your house keeper to get a room ready the guest that is physically there? I know it does not take two hours to clean a room. In between that time I saw other guest check in before me. I saw the Richard at the desk communicate with what looked like the head housekeeper Diana a few times, laughing a little, but I’m sure it wasn’t work related. There seemed to be no urgency to get me checked it. At 2:52PM I asked again about my room, still nothing. I made a comment that my room should be ready in 8 minutes (3PM). My email conformation said rooms were guaranteed at 3. Long story short I did not get checked in at three. The general manager Tara Barr came to get me in the lobby and checked me in not even 5 minutes after asking Richard the front desk agent if my room was ready yet. Note to Richard at the front desk; you shouldn’t take it personal when guest want to check in early, they usually want to rest and are tired after traveling. I’m assuming the GM sensed my frustration with her horrible front desk agent. Paul was the only front desk member who I really enjoyed. He was kind and VERY PROFESSIONAL. He made up for the rest of the agents lack of customer service.
I feel like the whole front desk staff (except Paul) was rude and unaccommodating. This includes the housekeeping staff. They came to knock on my door numerous times during my stay WAY TO EARLY. We’re in Vegas. On my check out day they knocked on my door at 830AM! Check out wasn’t until 12. How about going to the desk, getting a report of the VACANT DUE OUT rooms and not guest who are still sleeping on a Sunday Morning. We answered the door for one of the housekeepers who continued to yell at my sister because we were late checking out. The rooms were out dated. The sheets looked really old, the breakfast was oaky..I would recommend the Marriott Company offer some customer service training to their staff. They were the rudest inattentive staff I have ever dealt with. I am a hotel supervisor, My staff would never make someone wait on a room for so long, they would never be as impatient and short when we doing something like following up on a cab time. Bottom line I hate to say but I would NO recommend this hotel to anyone.
Room Tip: IF you need help at the desk. Speak with Paul he is great!

The shuttle took us to the strip for supper which was good. The next morning we were headed south on I 15 so we just drove right out. The front desk staff were friendly and helpful. The shuttle bus driver was very nice. The breakfast in the morning was really good. There were soccer teams staying here too yet it wasn't noisy at all. The only negative I have is that it was quite expensive for that type of standard hotel.</p><br>A lot for your buck<p>Great shuttle service and we loved our driver "Phillip" very helpful staff, especially Richard, at the front desk
Rooms are spacious with nice sitting area with additional TV and hit breakfast with lots of choices was a wonderful start to our day</p><br></body></html>
