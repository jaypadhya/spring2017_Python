<html><head><h3>Fairfield Inn & Suites Las Vegas South Hotel Reviews Page 6</h3></head><body><br>Very nice<p>Not an awful lot to say. It's a good option if you want to be away from the craziness of the strip. Check in was pleasant fast and efficient. Room spacious clean and comfy. It runs parallel to the strip with views of the strip. No real restaurants close by so have a car if you stay. Didn't try the breakfast cause we left too early for our flight. Close to most everything in vegas.
I'd stay again.</p><br>Satisfactory<p>This is, on balance, a satisfactory hotel, at a reasonable price; for older patrons who are not "into" the glitz and glamor of the major Casino-Hotels.

It is an especially very sound choice for non-gamblers.</p><br>Best stay in this price range ever in Las Vegas<p>This hotel is bit off from the Strip but worth staying here. To be very frank, this was a trail stay for us after the worst experience in LVH last year. Hotel is very clean and pretty new. Staff is very warm and also offered us free tickets for the Las Vegas shows. This hotel also provides free shuttle service to the strip and only drop off to the airport. Over all I will recommend this hotel.</p><br>Great Hotel for Visitors<p>We stayed here for two nights in November 2013 while we went sightseeing around the area. We do not gamble and the Fairfield Inn offers convenience to the main highway and the airport. The room was clean and large, the breakfast was hot and offered variety, and the service was pleasant and prompt. Airline crews take up about 40% of the rooms we were told and the hotel was full every night -- but you couldn't tell it. I would recommend it to anyone travelling through or around Las Vegas that is just looking for a nice room at a fair price.</p><br>Itching all night.<p>I have been staying at this hotel for probably 3 years on and off due to my company placing me here. I have never had the problem I am having here now. This is my second time staying here this month and both times, once I hop in bed for the night, I get itching all over my body. It's bad enough that it wakes me up. I checked in the bed to make sure it wasn't bed bugs, and I didn't find any. So my only other guess is that at some point they switch to a detergent for their sheets and towels. Whatever it is, its a new experience here and it's awful. Why stay in a hotel if you can't sleep there?</p><br>Silent 1st Floor<p>As a Marriott Rewards person, I know what to expect at each place I stay. This Fairfield was no exception. We arrived a bit early and were checked right in. We stayed in a spacious 1st floor suite with nice high ceilings. After a night out on the town, I was able to sleep for 9 hours without interruption... 3 more than I normally get. The mini-store had plenty of water, ice cream and medicine. Everyone was very cordial and helpful. I will definately return.
Room Tip: You might hear airport take-offs if the A/C is off. The 1st floor was quiet.

Its close enough to the strip for easy convience with a shuttle service, and the customer service is very friendly and they are very willing to make your trip much more enjoyable</p><br>Very helpful staff<p>Stayed here for a weekend convention. Loved the free wifi, shuttle and breakfast. Our group of 4 needed a refrigerator as one of our guests has special dietary needs. They helped out and immediately changed rooms for us. We appreciated the upgraded room without the extra cost.
Great for a business or family traveler.</p><br>Nothing Special<p>Arrived very late at night and interrupted the night auditors personal phone call to which his body language did not agree with serving guests. and it got worse after I came down to buy items in the market area about 20 minutes later, as he made it very clear he was being bothered, due to his comments he made to the person on the phone. The hallways and rooms are in need of a complete remodel, the tv/cable selections were very nice, the breakfast looked good, and the morning staff was very friendly and caring, and the outside of the building was very well cared for overall not sure if I would stay here again but it was worth a shot.</p><br>Completely different experience<p>Not the grand casino hotel, small convenient , located near the strip. Free wifi, free shuttle to strip, free breakfast and clean rooms. Great for a budget. Free parking, cheap gas nearby. Agree with another review. We are on 3 rd floor and sounds like Riverdance is performing above us. Other guests often have no clue about being respectful. If I know who they are I'd flatten their tires.</p><br></body></html>
