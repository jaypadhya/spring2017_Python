<html><head><h3>Fairfield Inn & Suites Las Vegas South Hotel Reviews Page 11</h3></head><body><br>Staff is like Family<p>I come to Vegas alot for business, and yes I would say this place is far more the best one to stay at. The staff there are great, they do their best for you. I do mean all of the staff. The hotel itself is nice and clean. Close to to Downtown, and yes there are resturants near by. I would tell anyone if you want a great hotel with great staff and price
you need to stay here.....</p><br>Outstanding Service and Great Accomadations<p>The Fairfield inn and Suites in South Las Vegas is a great place to stay whether your a business traveler as myself or a vacationer. Their service is always outstanding and any questions that could possibly come up are answered right away. They are very knowledgable about the area and will assist you where ever you need to go. Their breakfast is always very good. I stay there everytime I travel to Las Vegas and feel very rested when I leave,</p><br>For the price, this place was dirty and the amenities lacking.<p>The room set up is ridiculous. Crowded and not electronically friendly (few usable outlets). Our bathroom was dirty upon check-in; only one clean towel in there. No washcloths or handcloths; Coffee maker is a one-cup horror machine; Keys constantly needing to be re-keyed; nearest sister restaurant is only open for a few hours in the morning for breakfast, and in the evening for dinner; bar closed at 11pm. Never any fresh coffee in the pot, always empty. Breakfast fare skimpy. Drinking fountains didn't work and one of the elevators was constantly "out of order". The pool literally had garbage floating in it. I wouldn't want to stay in this place again.</p><br>Good Value and Great Location<p>I stayed two nights for business. I found my accommodations to the quiet, clean and comfortable, and a good overall value. They have a shuttle service that runs hourly between the hotel, MGM, and Mandalay Bay (7am to 12pm); with prior notice it will also take you to the airport and mall. This is a good service. The breakfast buffet is generous and offered some healthy options (e.g., hardboiled eggs, yogurt and cereal); complementary coffee is available all day. A good place to stay for the money, and a good location.</p><br>Not the strip but an okay option<p>Just on other side of freeway from strip. Very comfortable beds, good service, excellent breakfast. Next time however I'll look for a better price.</p><br>A little disappointed<p>Stayed with Marriot associate and so got $35/night rate which is good. However, A/C (not centralized) was very loud and can't adjust on fan speed - too noisy and too cold. Our room's (312) sink was clogged severely. Couple of tiles were broken on the bathroom wall in the tub area. Ventilation in bathroom not too good. Bed too soft for us. But we do like the off-the-strip location and it's in the south end so we skipped a lot of traffic. Towels weren't of good quality - not very absorbent.</p><br>Very good alternative to the noise of the Strip.<p>Was attending a trade convention at the Mandalay Bay but wanted to stay away from the smokiness of the casinos. This hotel was ideal as it had shuttle service right to the convention hall. Since I was without transport, I was also glad that the shuttle service also went to the Town Square shopping mall and to the south end of the Strip (MGM Grand).
Shuttle service ran till midnight so was grateful for that since I had to attend some evening business cocktails at the Mandalay.

Hotel had free wifi, free drinks, outdoor pool, and a good buffet breakfast.

Very happy with it. Would stay here again.</p><br>very enjoyable<p>I'm not sure how much this would have been as I did it on Marriott points, visiting Las Vegas for daughter's graduation. No complaints. Very clean room, very helpful and FRIENDLY staff, very nice breakfast with waffles, hard boiled eggs, cereals, COLD milk, yogurts, donuts, oatmeal with nice things like brown sugar and raisins. We felt very well taken care of at this place, assuming it isn't too expensive if you had to pay cold hard cash! This is on Dean Martin, so you cross over I-15 on Russell and at the next left you're on the southern end of the strip. There is hourly shuttle service over to the strip which is nice, and drop off (not pickup) to the airport. This was a very nice part of our trip.</p><br>Great place to stay for singles &amp; families<p>I have stayed at this FFI quite a few times -and each time I have NOT been disappointed. One time I stayed here with seven other women for a bachelorette party -the staff was very accommodating. The other times I have stayed have been with my family, which includes a husband and two small children (ages 5 and 2). Great free breakfast, clean rooms, free shuttle to the strip and great shopping (Town Square), friendly staff, too.</p><br>Dirt<p>We stayed two nights in the Farfield Inn in Las vegas. When we arrived, one of the beds had dirt sheets, problably used by another guest, and we had to call the housekeepping to change them. On the next day, the housekeeping didn`t show up to clean the room. My husband walked inside the room wearing only socks and they became so dirty that he throw them away.</p><br></body></html>
