<html><head><h3>Royal Resort, Las Vegas Reviews Page 13</h3></head><body><br>Great Location - Clean and not overcrowded<p>First Trips to America and obviously first trip to Las Vegas. I had done my research on the location of this hotel and surrounding areas so, felt I knew the place as soon as I got there

Taxi from the Airport was just under $19 +tip
Return trip was $16+tip - cheaper as taxi do not have to pay the extra when dropping off at the airport, on when leaving

I picked this hotel as I wanted to be able to leave the hotel and get onto the strip with out the hassle of walking through lots of Corridors and Casino's, it delivered exactly that

Our Room was on 6th Floor, had 2 Large Beds and a little balcony that overlooked the strip so, we could see The Riviera and Circus Circus All lit up at night. It had a Fridge, and a Filter Coffee machine, milk sugar etc was left along with the individual filter coffees. TV with remote

Bathroom had a hairdryer, shower, soap, shampoo's and body lotion

Calls are free when made from the room to local or free phone numbers, no charge applied. This waas good as I pre-booked a helicopter flight before coming away and needed to confrim the pick up time with them from our hotel

The room was very clean, was cleaned everyday, we stayed for 6 nights

I loved the Pool area, very quite, and a big must for me - the Pool was heated!! what a bonus.

There is a Ross Dress for less across the road, so, picked up some good bargains for my Son, a pair of converse cost $24, in the UK I would have paid around £35 0 so, big savings

Had breakfast everyday at Denny's which again, is just across the road.

Went into the majority of the bigger hotels which confirmed are decision making that we had picked the right hotel and location for ours needs. Was good to see the other hotels but, glad we were not part of all that hustle and bustle.

Thank you for making my husbands 50th a perfect one</p><br>Excellent budget option close to the Strip<p>Stayed here 3 nights in total with my sister, either end of a road trip around the Southwest. This is a perfect budget option, within spitting distance of the Strip, just behind the Encore hotel.

Service was friendly, the room was clean, well-appointed and roomy with nice views on either side. It is a quiet location with handy local amenities like a Walgreens and an excellent taco bar.

The spa is particularly nice to relax in after a day hiking the Strip. This is where I will stay again when I return to Las Vegas.</p><br>Great Value in Vegas<p>I was in Vegas for a business conference - I only was allotted $60 per day - so I looked for hotels that fit the bill. The reviews on Trip Advisor regarding this hotel are spot on. It is by no means fancy or luxurious BUT the rooms were spotless, the bed very comfortable, and the hotel in general is very quite.

My only complaint or warning to fellow travelers would be this - if you are looking for a hotel to workout in every day pick another hotel. The cardio machines are antiquated and work on and off.

The restaurant on premises is not owned or managed by the hotel; however, the food and entertainment on Friday and Saturday night is AMAZING!! I would say the food is the BEST value in Las Vegas.

Overall if you are on a budget and looking for a nice hotel one block off of the Strip, the Royal Resort should be your first choice!</p><br>Will be back!!<p>I stayed here for 9 days and will stay here again. I wanted to be close to the Riviera and it was right next door. The room was a good size and had a refrigerator in the room. Plus didn't have to pay any resort fee!</p><br>Excellent Value for $$; I'd go back<p>Hotel was clean, comfortable and close to the Strip. As a 60 yr old single female, I felt safe driving back at night (11pm), parking in the rear car park and walking to the front of the hotel. Dennys and Walgreens within 5 min walk. I would book there again.
Room Tip: When asked, I requsted only one bed. This mean I got a queen bed, plus a settee. Made room feel spa...

Wifi is $10... Too expensive for what we needed. Recommend going to McDonald's down the street and use their free wifi. Good fast food court nearby with Indian food (very good, but expensive for styrofoam take out.

Room had a small fridge and microwave, which came in very handy storing and reheating our leftovers.</p><br>Awful experience<p>We booked this hotel on mobile last minute through Expedia after a trip was cut short. When we arrived we were told we needed to provide a $100 incidental deposit. However, as this stop was unexpected and the trip carefully budgeted, we no longer had $100 available to (just my soon to be mother in law's credit card for emergencies) and was denied the room we had already paid for.

When I called Expedia they kept telling me it's standard policy for all hotels to have a deposit, but this was a first for me. I am well travelled, I guess I just don't normally stay in nice enough places. Lesson learned for me.

However Expedia did try to speak with the hotel and asked them to take a lower deposit (that we had) and they refused. When asked if the phone at the desk could be used to try and solve our problem (I was on the cell with Expedia), my fiancé was told that he should try the Walgreens across the street.

I'm 4 1/2 months pregnant and had been in the car over 20 hours (2-3 of which were spent waiting for a wreck to be cleared in the baking hot sun). I was exhausted. I didn't want any room service or HBO or wifi, I just wanted the bed and shower I'd already paid for and this hotel had no mercy. This is the worst hotel/travel experience I've had to deal with.

In a few days I will get my refund for this room, but because I instantly paid for it, we also no longer had enough of a deposit for the scheduled reservation in Phoenix, and had to just drive the remaining approx 2,000 home without real rest or showers.</p><br>last minute booking<p>I booked this accommodation through my timeshare and was pleasantly surprised. We had a studio room but it had more than I was expecting. There was a real sized fridge and a microwave. The room had a hideaway bed which was cool. The room was never cleaned for our once weekly cleaning and I had to hunt down housekeeping for new towels. The air conditioner had a few glitches. It wasn't hot but it also was not working properly. They were unable to resolve this during our stay. There are laundry services available. The pool area was great and offered free cabanas. Staff was very nice. There was a lovely porter who got me directions to several places. Not quite a time share resort but good for a weekly stay.</p><br>Good Value for a Good Room!!<p>I booked this room on Hotwire.com so I didn't get to see what hotel I was staying in until after I booked the room. I stayed Friday-Sunday for $55 a night. This hotel is just off the strip by Circus Circus. I have to admit I was a little worried considering the price I paid for the room but I was very pleasantly surprised. The king size bed was comfy and the room had updated ceramic tile in the bathroom and a mini fridge. No free wi-fi (which kinda sucked) but overall I was very satisfied. I enjoyed not being right on the strip. It's near a Denny's, 7-11 and Walgreens (very convenient) and had a great pool. I would stay there again for sure. I'm glad I took the gamble on Hotwire and it was much better then a Super 8 or Days Inn or anything like that.
Room Tip: Plan on paying for internet if you want it during your stay. There is no casino in this hotel but it...

But I've made a really good deal though! We arrived at 2.00PM and there was already a room available, so we didn't have to wait. We asked for a room with a micro (in advance) and I saw it on the reservation as a comment. We were able to choose a room (parkinglot view, Riviera view of pool view). We had a room with a balcony, too bad there was a hearwave going on... We get a parking permit without asking. The hotel is perfect if you want a hotel within walking distance to Treasure Island, but too far to walk to Monte Carlo etc. There are restaurants across the street (Denny's, Peppermill -> very good by the way).

The room was large enough to store your belongings. We had fresh sheets en plenty of pillows! There was even a second sheet available if necessary. De shower had enough pressure, but a little bit too low for us (we're kind of large..). The refridgerator was large and very cold! Also the a/c worked fine for us, even in de heatwave (with temperatures like 117F!). Our room get cleaned every day, good service! So was the pool, fresh towels every day. The cabana's were lovely and they didn't charge any fee for it.

I have one minus: the walls were thin as paper! You could exactly hear what you're neighbors were talking about. Get some earplugs!

But I want to recommend this hotel to EVERYONE who doesn't want to stay in the Strip, but does want the entertainment on the Strip within walking distance. I loved it, for me THE surprise of Vegas (was my second time in Vegas)! Would definitely come back!</p><br></body></html>
