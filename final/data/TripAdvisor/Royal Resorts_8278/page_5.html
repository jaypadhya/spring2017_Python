<html><head><h3>Royal Resort, Las Vegas Reviews Page 5</h3></head><body><br>Excellent PM Staff<p>I stayed at the Royal Resort the last week in February.
The location is great, especially, if you choose not to rent a car.
There is a Walgreens across the street for room supplies. The Peppermill Coffee Shop is a great place to dine any time of the day & has a warm vibe. There are multiple affordable places to eat within walking distance of the hotel.

The best feature of this hotel is the employees. The PM team was especially helpful, courteous & friendly. Kudos to Vonyel & Chris (front desk) & Teddy (security)!
Bobby Townsend, the concierge, is a God send! His in put was accurate & very valuable.

I took the airport shuttle ($8) to the hotel, which worked out great, so I asked for the shuttle to be contacted to bring me back to the airport, at the end of my stay. It turns out the shuttle never arrived, supposedly, because it was 6:30am & I was the only person being picked up. Luckily, a taxi saw me waiting outside the hotel & offered to take me to the airport for $12 :)

I would stay here again.</p><br>Great PM crew.<p>I had the opportunity to stop into the royal resort in Las Vegas this past Thursday night. The front desk team was very courteous and very helpful when I asked directions to local restaurants and events. Chris at the desk, security and Vinyel the manager were very friendly. The rooms are beautiful the pool is nice and you're located just off the strip. Shopping nearby and great food down the street. I totally recommend a stay at the Royal resort in Las Vegas.</p><br>Great price and accomodation<p>Stayed for 2 nights in Feb. 2015. Liked the loacation, not on the strip but near the Rivera hotel and casino. Quiet and close to budget priced eating and facilities.. You may want to rent a car. Clean and no resort fees.</p><br>More pros than cons<p>If you just want a base to explore Las Vegas then this hotel is for you. There is some old style vintage glamour about the hotel and especially the lobby which doesn't compare to the bling of the mini-city hotels up the strip but the location is great, just yards from the strip. There is no casino clad lobby to trek through if you don't want to play the slots every 2 minutes. The pool area is quiet and clean and it is a bit of an oasis of tranquility but still in the hub of the resort. The rear views are particularly good. You get a good view of the fairly new Vegas Eye a and the monorail etc. There are several eateries just across the road plus drugstores, souvineer shops, pharmacies etc. The staff are lovely and the concierge is worth his weight in gold. The bus stop is just yards away and you can get up and down the strip easily either on foot or by the bus. The bedrooms are definitely dated but they're spacious and the beds are comfy. The best bit for us is that we explored more of the big hotels because we weren't staying in one. I think i we had booked one of the flashy mega-hotels, we would have been less inclined to go in the others and probably missed out on some sights! Cost is good too so i'd recommend it if you're not just going out to gamble.
Room Tip: ask to overlook the back of the hotel and the views are pretty decent

Location is good, right off the strip by the Rivera.. Parking is abundant as the hotel is in my estimation is below 50% occupancy and the lot is nearly empty at all times. No Resort fees (AKA Rip Off Fees). The hotel is passable. no microwaves, little kiddie fridges, old box tvs with 10 channels. AC and room darkness are ok, with so so water pressure. Water refills and gym on 2nd floor. Pool is heated and nothing much to write home about. We got this room for about $27 a night for 5 nights. I would stay again at $30 or lower a night. The resort fees in Vegas are high and I won't pay them! Ever! Opps, wifi is $10 a day!</p><br>Not So Bad!!<p>After reading some of the reviews on this website, I was skeptical about this hotel but decided to give it a try anyway considering the prices being requested at other hotels in the area. The location is close to the strip very near the Encore and close to the convention center where you walk to and catch the monorail if you desire. The entire facility is dated, including the rooms, but it is well cared for and kept clean. Plenty of free parking in a well lit area and close enough to walk to the very popular Peppermill Coffee Shop. If you're looking for a place where you can lay around the pool all day and be waited on, this isn't it. If you want to save some money and sleep in a comfortable clean room while not paying any resort fees, stay here. In my book, its a well kept secret.</p><br>Disgusted with this place<p>this is the second time I have spent time at this resort. It was dirty and carpets were threadbare the first time, but my office booked it again since it is walking distance to the convention center. Never again. The day after arrival, Tuesday, Jan. 20th, 2015, the maid service didn't service the room. We got back from being on our feet all day as an exhibitor at the Builder's Show, and the room was a mess and the bed unmade. Then, to top that, two day later, they did it again! We paid almost $200 per night to come back and find a totally ignored room. wet towels, unmade bed... they never even looked in the door while we were out.

The carpets are so threadbare it is almost laughable... except they are charging Marriott rates for less than Super 8 accommodations and service. On top of that, the small restaurant there has the menu priced so high ($85 steaks!) that you may as well walk down the street to a decent priced place. I won't go back, and don't see how they can sell this place to time-share owners!
Room Tip: Run, don't walk away from this "resort" from Hell.
See more room tips</p><br>Old, worn--and neither the 2.5* nor condo claimed by Hotwire<p>Got a room here through Hotwire and it was largely misrepresented. According to Hotwire, it's a "2.5" star "condo"--and in actuality it is neither.

Let's start with the star level. Even before I set foot in the place--and I've stayed nearby in Vegas--I knew it wasn't even that high. It is in actuality somewhere between 1.5 and 2 stars. It calls itself a "resort," but that's about as accurate as "Best Buy." It's a small dated hotel with small rooms and few amenities.

As far as the "condo" clam? That's an out-and-out lie. It's run as a timeshare, but why anyone would want to own and return to a unit is beyond me. The rooms are some of the smallest I've ever seen in Vegas, barely large enough for the 2 queen beds, an armoire with the TV, and a dilapidated table with an ancient armchair. There's no kitchen area like you'd expect with a "condo." Heck, there's not even a microwave. Just a small refrigerator in an alcove outside the very small bathroom.

The beds have thin, somewhat firm mattresses. The pillows are small and lumpy. The carpeting is old and has sections that feel like they have old, dried-up spills on them. The room climate control is quite unable to get the room temperature below 70 degrees during the daytime--even though we're not talking about triple-digit temperature summertime, but 60s and 70s November. And the unit not only runs constantly, it's quite noisy. I needed earplugs to get a good night's sleep. And that was not the only noise.

I asked for a room to the rear to avoid street noise. And I was accommodated: 6th floor facing the back. Having a south-facing room means you're away from the noise of the street--and enduring the regular roar from the airport. The windows and sliding glass doors have very little, if any, sound insulation. The south side faces the flight path of many planes taking off from McCarran when they head west over the Wynn.

One indication of just how cheap the place is: in the bathroom, just shampoo, not even conditioner. Towels were thin. The water did get hot quickly.

The table and nightstand were in horrible shape. There was veneer peeling off of both (I don't have the photos available right now to post). The hallways were not at all friendly seeming, and the room had a slight unidentifiable odor, although not strong enough to warrant a complaint. The TV was rather small and just standard def.

About the only thing that pushes this up a half star is that the WiFi was included and it just worked. But then, that should be standard in every hotel. Other than that, it's just plain dilapidated. Not as bad as Mardi Gras, but not far behind it either.</p><br>Near to strip<p>Had booked the hotel as it was the cheapest I could find during the new year eve period.

Location was within walking distance to the strip. Room was spacious.

There was no breakfast provided not an issue as Denny's just right opposite the hotel. There is also a Walgreens nearby.

Overall good value for money during the new year eve.</p><br>Decent, but odd, stay<p>I stayed in room 734. I had arrived very early in the morning, so could not get a requested room towards the back of the hotel. Seeing other reviews, I can understand why. Everyone prefers quiet. The balcony door is only single pane glass and is poor at keeping street noise low. Early mornings, when the shops across the street are getting their garbage picked up, can be very noisy. The first night staying here, the hotel was evacuated by an emergency alarm, which no one could explain. This is how I came to use the emergency stairs. During the week, the doors to these emergency stairs were often left open, which made for a very unsecured hotel as the stairs have no secure door or gate below. Anyone from the street could walk up to your room door. I used no other amenities at the hotel other than the room itself. The woman at check-in was very friendly. The shops nearby were very handy for picking up some groceries to keep in the small room refrigerator. The hotel is very convenient to bus stops for the strip. The room itself was clean, with dated furniture. The tv had not yet been updated to a flat screen. Overall, I would stay here again if the price were low and security were better.
Room Tip: Get to the hotel early to try for a room towards the rear, facing South.
