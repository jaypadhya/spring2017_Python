<html><head><h3>Royal Resort, Las Vegas Reviews Page 11</h3></head><body><br>Not bad!!<p>The hotel was better than I thought, I've stayed at several hotels in Vegas and I wouldn't mind staying at this one again. Only down fall is it took me 30 mins to get a cab, but other than that no complaints!! I was glad to see a Walgreens and a Denny's very close by, that helped.</p><br>Awesome<p>We stayed at the Royal Resort both times we visited Vegas. Checking in is easy and fast, the rooms are just what you need: comfy bed, shower/bath with plenty of towelsl mini fridge, iron, coffee.

It's a fantastic place to chill out when your feet are swollen from epic strip walks. You can come in and out when you like and the room cleaners do a great job in the rooms. Always fresh and clean.

Only negative point would be lack of wifi (at least when we were there in 2013). I know you don't come to Vegas to look at the internet but when you're hungover sometimes it can help!
*****I don't know if the lack of wifi is still true as of April 2014*****

Regardless, we will go back any time we feel like doing Vegas again.

Thanks Royal Resort!</p><br>Great location, good staff and a pool<p>We loved our stay at the Royal Resort and I'm pretty sure that we'll come back the next time we visit Vegas!
The king bed was very comfortable, and everything was clean.
The curtains are thick, so you can sleep late without being bothered by daylight. The windows are tinted, which means you can enjoy the sun without being seen by people outside. Cool!

The location is awesome: just behind the Encore. The Strip is 10 minutes away. We walked to Treasure ISland, wre we saw Mystere by Cirque du Soleil. It takes only 15 minutes.
The Peppermill is a great restaurant on the other side of the street, open late. Perfect for brunches as well as dinner, with a fun ambiance and even vegetarian/ healthy options.
We had an awesome deal through hotwire: $30 a night (on a weekday).

We had no chance to try the pool, but the pool location behind the hotel is always sunny, which certainly makes it great.

The concierge of the hotel was attentive, but I am suspicious of him lying to us. First, he said he would not be working the next day, so we bought our tickets for the mob museum immeditaley. But the next day, we saw him working. Then he said he could get us tickets for the museum with a discount, but the price we paid was exactly the price offered at the museum. It was "will call'', not e-tickets, which means we still had to queue at the museum to get our tickets. The museum website, on the contrary, offers e-tickets... Not sure how helpful the concierge really is.

There was a little fridge in the room and a small coffee machine. I just wished we would have a kitchenette, because my husband is on a low-sodium diet, and it's very difficult to accomodate in Las Vegas.

The bathroom was small but convenient. We had a small bathtub, a sink, and some toiletries (soap bars, shampoo, lotion). The towels were changed everyday. I wish they had a policy where you can save water by telling them which ones need to be changed.
And like always, I'd love hotel batrhrooms to have some kind of natural air freshener dispenser. It's great to share a king bed, but not romantic to share everything with your partner. :)</p><br>Good stay<p>If you want to be close to strip with minimum pay and "ok" hotel the this is the one.
No casino or any other attraction in the hotel but also no resort fee , free parking in the front,quick check in and check out.
In total it's medium with good location.</p><br>Nice stay<p>We went as a group and it was nice to have a suite with both connecting rooms having bathrooms. It's not too far out of the way and less hectic than the casino hotels. The pool was really nice and warm! The pull out bed was quite uncomfortable though-could feel the mattress springs!</p><br>Great hotel!<p>Loved having two bathrooms in our suite. My daughter had the suite across the hall which also had two bathrooms. When you have 7 people trying to get ready to go somewhere, it's a big help. Saved us a lot of time.
Thanks for a great stay!</p><br>1chas1<p>Hi we enjoyed our stay for 8 nights at this hotel, we had 1 bedroom condo Which was 2 rooms adjoining which gave us a lounge and 2 bathrooms with a small kitchen.The bedroom was large with a kingsize bed there were just 2 of us but the suite would be okay for a family of 4.It has a great location close to the strip with a good bus service with no resort fee which is plus.The pool and the hot tub are fine,the hotel was very clean and I had free wi fi from the company I booked with,if you want a non gaming hotel to get some sleep away from the hustle and bustle this is it.You have free safe at reception,the staff are very helpful with a pleasant attitude,we will stop here again having stayed at many of the larger hotels I think we had good value.</p><br>Close to the Strip<p>Recently stayed there for 6 nights and booked via Expedia for a good price, the hotel is coneniently placed for both the Convention Centre and the Strip. The rooms are a good size if a little jaded looking .Beds are the usual large size and comfortable by American standards ,the TVs unfortunately aren't being fairly old and small in size. There are coffee making facilities and a fridge is provided. Could have done with a microwave in the room and the safety deposit boxes are available only at the reception. We had to call out maintenance to repair heating twice.

Also having to pay for Wi-Fi is a nusciance , The Denny's around the corner has free wifi .

Can't comment on the Pools as it was too cold to use them.

All in all for the price we paid it was still good value for money</p><br>Good Location - Good Rooms<p>It has a great location just off the Strip and within a minute walk you can reach the Fashion Mall which has some good restaurants and shopping including Macy's Men.
Rooms are well sized and clean.
Only disadvantage is that all the rooms have a door with the adjoining room and there is a 2" gap at the bottom - so you are forced to listen on whatever is happening there. Checked 3 rooms when I checked in but all have the same issue so be prepared for this discomfort in case you get someone who wants to talk on the phone at 3AM for an hour.
Room Tip: The non smoking floor rooms are a good option.

Our booking was a last minute one night stay on the way to Los Angles. Searching online for an inexpensive hotel near or on the strip, the Royal kept coming up on the list. I picked the Royal because they did not add $15-$20 per night fee that other hotels added. We laughed as we entered the lobby because we felt like we were in the 1950s Las Vegas. Low ceilings, no noise or smoke. A great place to shoot a "Rat Pack movie". Check in took 2-3 minutes because there was NO LINE. Our room, while a bit smaller than many in the new mega resorts was very clean, updated and not worn. Very surprising. We did not use, but we could see the pool from our room and counted 3 (three!) people in it. It has 3 cabanas and a hot tub. It looked like a nice place to relax away from the mega pools. Plenty of free parking and a short walk to the Encore. We will be back.</p><br></body></html>
