<html><head><h3>Royal Resort, Las Vegas Reviews Page 2</h3></head><body><br>Worthy of staying again<p>We booked this place as we were landing in Vegas on a Friday night travelling long distance from Australia. We knew we would be very tired and didn't want to pay the triple hike of fees that hotels asked for on the strip. This place was a pleasant surprise for the cost. The room was clean, the bed and pillows very comfortable, nice big bathroom and bar fridge in our room. Close and easy access to the strip and the SDX bus stop pretty much out the front. Would definitely stay again. We stayed 3 nights and would have stayed longer but it was booked out due to conventions in town. For the price it was a great find in Vegas.</p><br>Easy walking distance of the Strip<p>Clean, well presented hotel in very convenient location. Good happy hour in Barrymore,s Cocktail bar with good selection of small plates and a reasonably priced bottle of wine. On the other hand if you fancy a very nice bottle of Chateau Lafitte you only need $5200!
Room Tip: Rear room overlooking outdoor pool towards Wynns Encore Hotel

The pool and jacuzzi was perfect and open till midnight. Hotel staff is kind and helpfull.
The only bad thing about the hotel that they do not offer free wifi however you could prepay it for fair price.
Excellent stay if you visit LV for a reasonable price.</p><br>Great hotel to visit Vegas<p>We had great time at Royal Resort. The location is close to the bus station. The bus took us everyday to the strip and we enjoyed our time. The hotel, unlike others in Las Vegas was smoke free, it was very important for us.
The pool was nice and the jacuzzi great. We really enjoyed the room as it was spacious and cleaned every day. We also appreciate the staff who went out of there way to assist us in every question and suggestions.
Overall it's great place when visiting vegas, don't miss it</p><br>Decent value and location<p>The hotel is walking distance to the Las Vegas Convention Center as well as the Treasure Island end of the strip. For the price it was a decent value - less than half the cost of staying directly across the street from the LVCC. The hotel is showing a little wear and tear, but not too bad. The two negatives I would give it are you have to pay for WIFI. It was about $10 a day or $20 for three days. Also there is no business center however the staff at the front desk was excellent and were able to print off my airline boarding passes for me. The only other things to note are their restaurant is only open for dinner, so no breakfast, lunch but Denny's is very nearby and also I never saw the Concierge of the 3 days I was there (Wednesday to Friday). Not a big deal but some people rely on them for help with reservations etc.</p><br>Vegas on a budget <p>Hotel was neat and tidy. Non gambling which was fine. Staff were friendly but not fantastic. Pool area was nice and relaxing. Very short walk to bus stop where strip buses run. Overall would recommend if you are after an affordable room that's not too far from the heart of the strip.</p><br>Nice quiet hotel<p>Stayed a toal of 3 nights.2 nights on the first leg of my trip and the last night of my trip last week of september.2 different rooms. Both had what I needed.mircowave fridge coffee marker. Very comfortable bed.great location.has outdoor pool The staff are super great.vongal is wonderful. The hotel could use an update. The outlets on lamps did not .bad internet.work.it has no casino but all and all I stay here again.</p><br>No complaints<p>My friends and I were in Vegas this past weekend for the jazz fest in Henderson, Nevada, and we stayed at royal resort. The rooms were decent and clean, staff was helpful. we arrived very early Friday morning, but was unable to check-in. The hotel did offer to keep our luggage. Becase the concert started at 3pm, we were worried that we wouldn't be able to check-in late after the concert, but after talking to the front desk attendant, she assured me that we could check -in, and she left a note letting that staff know that we would be checking in late due to us attending a concert in Henderson, Nevada. Check-in was fine. Our refrigerator wasn't working. we called the front desk, and someone was at our room in a matter of minutes to fix it. Location was ok, not much is going on around the hotel. but we knew that when we booked because we were primarily there for the concert. The hotel does have a bar and a pool. I would absolutely stay here again</p><br>worst trip ever<p>BEWARE OF TRIP ADVISOR!!! the hotel lost my reservation and would not give me a room. even though I had a email conformation for the nights that I had already paid for. it was on Sept.11 2015. in conclusion its been A WEEK AND IM STILL WAITING ON MY REFUND!!! also don't try to call them if its after hours. i could not get a hold of a trip advisor representative for they do not Have a 24hr hotline Im not sure what was worst the royal resorts manager or not being able to get ahold of trip advisor.</p><br>Me and hubby anniversary!!<p>I was a little disappointed the bar wasn't open during our stay.But I like that everything was in reach.Denny's across the street and Marshall's.RR is in old Vegas but you get your money worth.A very nice and friendly enviroment for your money.</p><br></body></html>
