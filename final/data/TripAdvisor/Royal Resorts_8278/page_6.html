<html><head><h3>Royal Resort, Las Vegas Reviews Page 6</h3></head><body><br>Royal Treatment Fantastic Hotel<p>Its located just off the strip! Close to Wynn and Riviera. Vonyel checked us in and was the friendliest Las Vegas person we have met so far. Thank you for the directions to the Riviera for gaming. We are dinner near the fire in Barrymores, a Fancy place to dine in this kitchey hotel just off the strip. Thank you for a wonderful stay.
Room Tip: Vonyel up sold us to a better view room, It was totally worth it, Great Lights in this Neon City
See more room tips</p><br>Great Staff makes up for the tired hotel<p>We stayed here for 3 nights during a convention, great location for that purpose only 10 minute walk to convention center and close to some conveniences. The staff was VERY friendly and helpful. The hotel could definitely use an upgrade. Everything is old and worn, although the rooms were clean. The restaurant onsite is an exception! Barrymores is first rate and a pleasant surprise!</p><br>Great Bargain<p>We stayed at the Royal Resort while we were in Las Vegas in January. Our room was not elegant but clean and nice. The best part was the price, it was a bargain and we would not hesitate to stay there again.
Room Tip: Don't expect the Bellagio but if you want a clean inexpensive place to stay while you do Vegas i...
See more room tips</p><br>Would have been nice if.......<p>I stayed for 5 nights and got the place through Priceline. The rate was excellent. The room was comfortable, but the old tv was hideous. No reason to have a non digital tv in this day and age. Charging $10 for internet access was a bit ridiculous, but I used my cell phone to connect. The front desk people were helpful and I got a top floor room as I always like to stay as high as I can. It was a quiet time before Christmas, and as I left the day after people started to come in. I wouldn't stay there again with the horrible tv and paid internet access.</p><br>Too much the dowager...<p>This is an older property in an older area of the strip in Las Vegas, and both the property and the area need additional upgrading. The property management staff at the hotel tries hard and does a good job with what they have, but its hard when lots of issues arise simply due to the age of the property. I had issues with the heating system in my unit, and while Johnny and Jorge were extremely responsive and got it fixed, it took a few tries. I liked the spaciousness of the unit (actually two connected hotel rooms, one of which has been converted to a living room), and having two bathrooms, but wish a kitchen had been added when the suite was converted. There are effectively no activities at the property, and the outdoor pool and Jacuzzi were not useful this time of year. I did use the exercise room, and did enjoy the fact that there is a gifted concierge on site. Because this is Vegas, however, the lack of onsite activities is not a real let down. As for the area, the hotel is right off the strip behind the Wynn and the Wynn Encore, and between them and the Riviera. I think the area is primed for additional major development since the economy in Vegas is finally picking back up, but for now, it is still somewhat bleak. That said, the property is also very convenient for the LV Convention Center. For timeshare owners or traders, like me, the wifi is free - for hotel renters it is an extra charge. It has acceptable speed.
Room Tip: As for a room on the back side overlooking the pool. The view is of a parking lot, but also looks o...
See more room tips</p><br>Great quiet budget option<p>My daughter & I spent a couple of nights in Las Vegas for an air mile run, and wanted a safe, low-cost quiet hotel close to the strip. This was it! No casino, quiet, $117 for two nights, and we felt perfectly safe. The room furniture was actually very nice, and the beds were comfortable. The only changes I would recommend--that would take this place up a full star level, IMHO (from 2-3)â€”are to get white duvets with a color strip, and upgrade the pillows (cheap foam). The dark, hideous comforters downgraded what was otherwise a perfectly nice room. Also, real Centrex phones are an important safety feature. I can't think of another time when I stayed in a hotel that basically had a princess phone that couldn't even dial the front desk. We would have had to look up the phone number of the hotel and call it from outside! (???). No taxi line, BTW, the front desk has to call a taxi. But, it never took more than 5 minutes to get one. And, the front desk staff was VERY nice and couldn't have been more helpful.
Room Tip: Ask to be away from the elevators.
See more room tips</p><br>Not really good for couple<p>my tour agent give me this hotel.. im not choose by my self..
looks like a old hotel.. the room is bit smelly for sensitive nose like me..
the furniture is not modern for us..
overall we still can sleep here.. hahaha</p><br>Great budget hotel<p>We stayed for nine nights in November and were very happy with the accommodation for the price we paid. It definitely wasn't fancy, but the price reflected that. The room could do with an upgrade, but we were only in there to sleep and shower, and we would rather have the money in our pockets! The beds were comfortable and I liked being able to open the patio doors and let the fresh air in. The bus stop on the strip was only five minutes walk to the hotel, and it only took a few minutes to get to our room. An absolute bonus when we were tired out from walking all day. No big casinos to navigate!! The express bus stopped in the street a little way from the hotel, which made it easy to get downtown and to the attractions on the strip.Our shower was good and we liked having the fridge in the room. Staff were helpful and let us use the hotel ipad to check in for our return flights and print our boarding passes. We didn't experience any noise during our stay.
Room Tip: Get a room on a high floor to get the best views of the strip
See more room tips</p><br>Awful <p>From the outside the hotel looks good and the reception though lacking any atmosphere was ok. We were very tired after a long drive from LA and didn't ask to see the room BIG mistake. The room was in urgent need of a total refurbishment, the room was not very well cleaned and everything felt grubby. The air conditioning fan in the bedroom would not switch off and the smoke detector was missing. To be fair when this was mentioned to the reception staff the issues were attended to. The general attitude was very offhand and we were made to feel that they were doing us a favour letting us stay.</p><br>Very good hotel<p>Not a very fancy hotel, but when you need a place to sleep against a very reasonable price and close to the Convention Center, this is it. The rooms are clean, the staff is very helpful. In particular the concierge, Bobby Townsend, is the man to help you around in Vegas.
One tip: DO NOT go for dinner at the nearby Korean place. Service sucks, prices ridiculous and food so so. Instead the nearby Pepper Mill restaurant is pretty good.</p><br></body></html>
