<html><head><h3>Royal Resort, Las Vegas Reviews Page 1</h3></head><body><br>Overall good hotel<p>We stayed here for a week and never had a problem. Bed was comfortable and the room was clean. Staff was very friendly and helpful which made us feel welcomed. Parking lot is big and had a security guard.</p><br>Only good for coventions<p>When you're in town for a convention at the Las Vegas Covention Center, the Royal Resort is okay. It' about 600 yards from the main entrance of the Convention Center. Its location close to the north end of the strip is convenient, too. It offers enough parking spaces. But the hotel has seen better days. The hotel lobby isn't inviting at all. There are many small items that leave an unpleasant memory: the hotel entrance door did not work properly and wasn't repaired during my stay - which lasted one week. The elevators were not clean. WiFi costs about ten bucks per day and is really slow. The doors of my room couldn't be locked properly! I booked the Royal Resort via booking.com. Therefore the price was okay. When I'm back in town for more than one night, I would choose another hotel that offers at least free WiFi.</p><br>Rochelle was Amazing!<p>I was welcomed by a lovely lady by the name of Rochelle who just oozed warmth and positivity at reception. She was so kind that she has made me provide an excellent review with a couple of hiccups along the way. The place was reasonably cheap to be so close to the strip and although I was moved rooms because of some plumbing issues it was not really a problem. The foot I was on was a bit dated like 1980s dated but I did not mind as the price I paid probably reflected that. Rochelle is a credit to your company. Thanks again for the nice welcome. Regards. Colin</p><br>Customer Service OUTSTANDING<p>I was at the Royal Resort in October and I have to say their night front desk manager is the best customer service person I have met in Las Vegas. Vonyel was so helpful in getting us the right room and directions to the best places to party in Las Vegas. Vonyel said to eat at Pieros which was delicious. We gambled at the Palace Station. We also went to the Hooters where we enjoyed wings. Thank you Vonyel for all the great suggestions and for taking care of us so welll in Las Vegas.
Room Tip: Just ask for Vonyel

Although when you walk into the hotel lobby it looks very fancy, the actual room we had was very old and in dire need of renovations.</p><br>Get what you pay for<p>This is not a five star hotel by any means but doesn't charge like one either. Just off the strip, there really isn't anything very close (as far as short walk) and the hotel doesn't have any amenities that are open during the day for breakfast, lunch or even snack from gift shop (there isn't one). The staff is a little rough as far as communication but were nice enough. For example, a gentleman asked which room is friend was staying in. Instead of just having him pick up the house phone right there and connecting him, staff went into three minute light argument explaining that she doesn't really know if that is really his friend and she can't give out that information, etc, etc before finally saying he could just call the room.

Had to change initial room as there was some type of sewer smell. They quickly changed rooms without a problem and explained that the city was working on the sewer line out front and that that end of hotel was being affected. Second room smelled fine.

Lobby was clean but most of the lights were turned off so seemed dark. The room was clean as far as daily housekeeping. Bedding and towels were clean and not worn but were motel 6 quality. Very dated rooms with furniture showing its age. I was in a "suite" which is basically two rooms with one side having been converted to living room. One couch was very worn and the other had oil/grease stains that looked like.....well, I'll just say we didn't sit on that couch.

They charge a 100 deposit. If you pay with cash or don't have one, they make you wait for housekeeping to check the room for damages before you leave when checking out. I had a credit card up and they didn't make me wait to check the room

Overall....would I stay again? No. We booked it as the strip hotel were sold out and it was close to where friends were staying. Next time, I can't get on the strip, I will stay another 1/2 mile out at one of the hamptons or similar type hotels.</p><br>Excellent low cost hotel near the strip<p>This hotel is older but was clean and less than a quarter mile from the Strip. The front desk staff was friendly and helpful. Our room was large, clean and neat. The bed and pillows were comfortable. The furniture was outdated but that didn't matter.

It is close to the bus stops.</p><br>Great spot - just off the strip - free parking <p>We stayed here for a week via Trading Places. We really enjoyed our stay! Nice pool and hot tub, friendly staff, comfortable room and free wifi. The building is old, but clean. Rooms have refrigerator and microwave. Not too big of overwhelming.</p><br>Not worth the low price!<p>I called 1 day prior to arrival to request a poolside room and was told: "You can request whatever you want honey but that don't mean you're gonna get it!" Didn't matter really- the rooms looked clean but run down. "Balcony" (which was not quite large enough to stand on) door didn't open. Beds were comfy. Water pressure in the shower was ok- nothing great. Carpet looked like it should have been replaced a few years ago. Ample parking which was patrolled by a tow truck. Very close to the strip. Was glad we were only there one night!
Room Tip: Avoid! Pay more and get better:)

Right across the street is a Dennys, 7-11 and Walgreens. No Wi-fi! No continental breakfast, room not too clean. The cost was the best in the area. The best part - our plane was leaving late and Royal have a secure storage room for customers luggage and we were able to tour throughout the day and then go back and retrieve our luggage. This was a free service. Also, the manager let us check out later than 11 which was really nice. Hotel okay for a very short stay.</p><br></body></html>
