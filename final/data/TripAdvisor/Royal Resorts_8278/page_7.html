The reason I chose this hotel is location, location, location. The hotel is perfectly located within walking distance to the convention center, right next to the Strip, and across the street is a Walgreens and Denny's.
The Lobby has an old feel to it, but I liked it. It is nice, clean and attached to the hotel is a restaurant, the Barrymore or whatever it is called. Food there is on the pricey side. I did not eat there. Check in was quick and painless, and Hotel staff was very friendly.
We had a room on the 7th floor facing convention center drive. Before entering the room, I noticed that the room door had a lot of scrapes and scuff marks, which made me wonder what I will find inside.
Well, the room was very clean, so was the bathroom, bed also clean, but one of the bed sheets had a rip in it.
The bathroom must have been recently renovated and was nice. But the room itself just looked "tired". The carpet was pretty worn, cracks along the edges where the wall meet the ceiling and the sliding glass door. It sure could use a little TLC.
Also the walls are paper thin, so if your neighbor has a party, this could get loud.
Now some more positive items. The room had a mini fridge and a coffee maker. I did like that.
Also the hotel has great prices and NO resort fees!
I also used the heated outdoor pool and hot tub, that is very nice.

All in all, it is a good hotel when attending a convention or trade show and you don't want to constantly rely on cabs to get around.
The price is great and no resort fees!!
Will I stay there again? Most likely for another trade show. But I would not stay there for an extended family vacation.
Room Tip: If you want less noise, ask for a room away from the street, a pool side room.

The rooms are large, but Super 8 quality at best. Old carpet, furniture, beds and old televisions. Amenities are pretty limited at the hotel and the restaurant in the hotel is very high priced.</p><br>SEMA Show<p>Royal Resort being right up the street from the convention center made our recent stay perfect. Very clean hotel and staff was great. Very affordable and centrally located. Would recommend this Hotel to anyone as it was a great stay for our five days in Las Vegas.</p><br>What is not to love about this hotel!<p>I need to start by staying I've stayed at a lot of hotels in Las Vegas, going all the way back to the original Frontier. My most recent trip found me in Las Vegas on a whim with no reservation in advance. I made a reservation upon arrival via Priceline, and it gave me The Royal Resort. I have been by this hotel in the past and made a mental not to check it out, but never followed through. Once I showed up I was informed that the hotel was SOLD OUT and that there was no way Priceline should have allowed me to book a room there. Shift Manager Vonel assured me that I would get my room, however the system would not accept input of the reservation. Vonel kept working at it and finally got me a room. I was highly impressed that someone would go to this effort especially with the reservation made through a third party. Needless to say, I found the room to be excellent. Mine faced the north. The room was well decorated, everything in working order, shower powerful and hot, and quiet! The pool is temperature controlled, huge and beautiful. Also, the hotel location is also excellent, with proximity to the SDX and other bus routes. The nearest stop for the SDX is very close, less than a two minute walk. One really nice thing is that this property charges NO RESORT FEE which I find is usually just more income for the hotel. Please note there is no casino here - it is just a hotel. I had a great stay, and I want to thank Vonel again for working so diligently to make it happen. Well done. I will certainly stay here again.
Room Tip: I can't see how any room would be a bad room. I'd like to stay on the pool side next time i...

The hotel was clean and did have a small balcony on the opposite side of the pool. Our sink got clogged and as soon as we told the receptionists someone was at our room fixing it within 5 min and didn't have any other problems after that. We stayed here for a week and it was a good hotel overall.</p><br>Pictures are deceiving<p>We stayed here through our time share exchange. Definitely lower quality than our home resort. In fact, besides the lobby, I would classify it as a motel. You should know that the rooms are clean but definitely outdated. Old carpet, furnishings, bathroom, etc. The patio is nice, but again older. Nice size pool and hot tub. Average service. Barrymore's attached to the place was very nice, but very expensive. If you are looking for a inexpensive and clean place to stay this is for you. If you are looking for updated and luxurious, look elsewhere.</p><br>Fabulous Las Vegas!<p>The benefits of our one week stay:
1. No resort fee - in a city where resort fees are rampant this hotel has no hidden charges - and the main reason for our choice.
2. We drove all night to Las Vegas and, even though check-in time is 3pm, reception allowed us to wait in the swimming pool area on the comfy loungers until a room was available at 12:30pm.
3. The hotel is well located and most of the Strip can be covered on foot.
4. We loved being able to park close to the hotel - no huge parkade and miles of corridors to the lobby and elevators.
5. We made good use of the fridge and coffee maker. The towels were new and of high quality but the bedding was old.
6. Free internet was not available in the room but was affordable - $35 for the week.
We would definitely stay here again if the price is right.</p><br>Nice place.<p>this old style hotel is a great place to stay if u like being near your car and being close to all of the casinos. The poo area is so nice and the jacuzzi is really warm. I plan to go back in dec. we used the concierge for some show advice and he was spot on. He also received an award for 'mayors choice.' Stay here on your next visit. :)</p><br></body></html>
