<html><head><h3>Royal Resort, Las Vegas Reviews Page 20</h3></head><body><br>Very poor communication<p>Our stay was not very nice.
There was no restaurant as promised since it was under construction.

Therefore this was a lost of noise starting at 6 AM!!!!!!!!!

We were not told that our rooms would not be cleaned on a daily basis.
We were not warned that a loud prom party would be held on our first night there.

Will never go back to this place.</p><br>Great, but very very loud<p>This hotel is an excellent deal and super close to the strip. The room was very large for the price. However, if you are jetlagged or would like to nap or go to sleep before 10pm, know that the entire back side of the building is exposed to the pool area, which has music so loud I literally could hear the walls shake. I called to be transferred to another room. After I moved to the other side of the building, I could still very faintly hear the music through the hallway (and the other set of rooms). So, when you check in, if you don't want to be bombarded by music, ask for a room on the front side of the building (even numbered rooms).</p><br>Vegas on a budget<p>Towards end of the strip,quiet if you want to sleep.Need flat shoes to walk anywhere in Vegas!Hotel decor abit tired but room clean,fridge,microwave,coffee maker only,take travel kettle if you want tea! Small bathroom,brill big comfy bed. Balcony rail good for drying clothes.Fab pool to use during day to chill out with gazebos available 1st come basis.No breakfast but loads of restaurants at top of road, and Mcdonalds.Free parking.Medium size ok gym. Did a DIY drive trip to Grand Canyon.Skywalk on west rim. Expect to pay loads to native indians who own it and charge a fortune!</p><br>Clean Quiet Hotel<p>This hotel is clean,quiet and in a good location. It's just a 10 min walk to the Convention Center, Fashion Mall and most of the major hotels. The hotel provides basic services. If you are looking for a full service hotel you should find another place. I like that the room had a small refrigerator. There is a Walgreens, Dennys and 7-Eleven accross the street.

According to Trip Advisor this hotel also has a time share thing going on. Not sure what that's about. If you just need a clean quiet hotel in a good location this is a perfect place

Room was cleaned everyday

The only negative comment I have is that room had an older TV that had a poor picture/bad reception on some channels.</p><br>NOT SO GOOD<p>Im an grand desert owner and this hotel dose not come close to grand desert .
I will never stay at the royal vacation suites again. and real promblem is the person who i talked to said it`s just like grand desert but smaller. no it`s nothing like grand desert
so please have the owners contact me so i can let them know.</p><br>lousy time share resort<p>I traded a time share week in hawaii for this! my one bedroom unit consisted of two hotel studios conected together. very loud hotel,traffic noise on road side was very loud.one washer and dryer on every other floor,there maine business seems to be hotel stays for people on a tight budget.the only thing nice about this place was the pool and hot tub.this is a featured resort in trading places,do not waste your good time share resorts for this underperformer.</p><br>Uninterested employees<p>For Vegas this is a place with very bad service. On top of the little 'quirks' with the employees on the front desk, I had a package sent to me via USPS.It never reached me. The hotels says USPS never dropped it there. USPS (with the package tracking number) shows, on its website, that the package was delivered.
So, who to trust?!</p><br>Peace and Quiet<p>We stayed at the Royal Resort for 3 nights. The room was large, clean and quiet. The kingsize bed was nice to sleep in and the large flat screen tv was there to enjoy. As this was a timeshare resort we did not get daily housekeeping as expected. The location is just off the strip with easy access within walking distance to some nice casinos and restaurants and the very nice fashion mall. We really enjoyed the hotel and would stay there again for the peace and quiet.</p><br>From worst to best<p>I book my res. thought travelovity two week beofe, they charged my card but he day before i left RVS did not have my info. Long story short I spent at least 8 hous on approx. 10 calls to travelocity with no conclusion. I took the chance and showed up anyway, The manger Was the best she got my Info made a couple of calls and took care of me, something travelocity should have done. Wounderful Staff.
As for my room and stay they were great. My room other than being a little smaller then what i am used to it was great. The pool is nice along with cabanas. It has no casino, bar and restaurant wehre being remodled, Denny's, Ross, Walgreen's, Mc Donald's and a couple of casinos are very close by. It is a nice 30 - 40 minute walk to the center of the strip but goes fast. I can go ono and on. Look at the pic's on line yes that is what you get nice, clean, quiet rooms at a great price.</p><br>Loved it !!!!<p>We have just returned from staying here for 2 weeks.After staying in a large Hotel on the strip previously we found this hotel to be so much nicer. No slot machines .Although the hotel didn't provide food etc It is so close to the strip ,just a short walk away with everything you need 24/7 . Ross (great for clothes shopping ) is just across the road , also Walgreens .We managed to get a cabana every day beside the pool as it was quiet in the hotel.My husband and our friends we travelled with all said we would stay in this hotel again , and we would recommend it to others as well.</p><br></body></html>
