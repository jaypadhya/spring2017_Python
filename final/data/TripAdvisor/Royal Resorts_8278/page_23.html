The lobby was neat and clean and front desk staff friendly. However, once we entered our room, we could notbelieve how out-dated and dirty it appeared. The carpet had stains and bathroom moldy. Also our air-conditioner didn't work until the last day. We called and reported the problem and said they "fixed" it, but that was not the case. They need to remodel this hotel, but for the price I guess we got what we paid for. We would never stay here again.</p><br>Pool is closed!! They don't advertise that.<p>We booked a 2 room suite which was nice and updated. 2 bathrooms and 2 TV's were convenient. We were very disappointed to find out after we checked in that the pool was closed. One of the reasons we booked the property was that the picture of the pool looked so good and considering it is warm in Las Vegas, we were looking forward to lounging around the pool. When I asked about it at the front desk, the clerk just nodded her head and acknowledged that, yes, it was closed. They are supposedly building a spa but we didn't see any work being done and the gate to the pool was locked. Very disappointing. The resort should include that in their advertising.</p><br>Works for Us<p>Our Stay Feb 22 to Feb 29,2008

Overall : The front desk,staff and housekeeping were very friendly, helpful and accommodating. It's always a plesant experiance to see smiling faces from the employees. They all seemed interested that we were satisfied with our stay. In general, the previous positive reviews seem to be inline with our observations. There are a some issues I will address later.

The Hotel: Yes , It is a little dated but you can not compare it to the strip mega hotels. It's clean and fresh as it could be with a great lobby. There is plenty of parking. The internet sites rate this hotel rate it as a three star which seems to be a fair rating. Being 1/2 block from the strip and exercise walking distance to a lot of the hotels is a plus. The older reviews on this site appear to be contrary to some of the above. It looks like management has made the necessary corrections.

Accomadations: The rooms are a standard size hotel/motel type area. Nothing fancy but certainly pleasant.. We did find the wall plasma TV, the apartment size frig and the microwave an extra, We don't eat out a lot, so this came in handy for in-room meals.

Concerns; Noise- Some reviewers rated the noise factor as quite. This could be relaive to your neighbor quests. You can hear people talking in the hallway - inconsiderate slaming of
doors. You may take part in the audio portion of the honeymoon couple in the room next to you. The walls are not very sound proof. This issue was minor for us but you should be aware of what could happen.

Smoking: The hotel rooms are non-smoking but this does not apply to the outside room balcony. It was our luck to have a smoking couple next to us. Even with the sliding glass door closed, the smoke would filter into our room. It was only for one night so we survived our one week stay.

In spite of the minor issues above, we would go back to this hotel again. The value and location make it all worth the stay.</p><br>Royal Resort Is A Little Shabby, Not Too Clean<p>I stayed at the Royal Resort in Las Vegas January 11-18, 2008. Upon driving into the parking lot I noticed the building in general looked a bit tired and in need of a little love. The lobby was the best part of the hotel as the rooms and halls were at the very least shabby and seemed a bit run down. I stayed on the 5th floor facing the Wynn Casino. Upon entering my room the little room fridge door was open and the fridge was not cleaned out. The lock on the sliding glass door to the outer balcony/ledge was broken, and my supposedly non-smoking room smelled of smoke. I spoke to the front desk and they moved me to the non-smoking room next door. It too smelled of smoke and there were cigarette burns on the countertop. Overall the room just seemed a bit dirty like the cleaning staff just does the bare minimum to make the room ready for the next guest. I did not want to touch the beadspread, or walk barefoot on the carpet. The couch in my room was made of a velvet material and was also dirty. I asked for an extra sheet from houskeeping to cover the couch with before I would sit on it. My mattress was worn and I could feel the springs poking up in certain spots. The bathrooms were adequate, but small. The shower had a previous guest's hair stuck on the shower wall and wasn't very clean. I am a person who doesn't need perfection, but I do like things somewhat on the clean side to feel comfy. This hotel did not feel very comfy because I really didn't want to touch anything in my room because it seemed dirty. While the location was good, I probably would not stay here again.</p><br>Decent Rate, Decent room<p>This was a trip to see the New Frontier implosion. It seemed to me that room rates were discustingly high for my taste $200-$600 was way over my budget I happend onto the Royal resort through another website it was dirt cheap more to my budget. I went to check in, the front desk was alittle on the rude side but very efficiant. To my suprise my room overlooked the new frontier I was more then excited now I wasn't going to have to leave my room and try and find a space at 2 o'clock in the morning. somethings were that the halls and the room were sprayed with something nauseatingly sweet due to the paint and stale smell, the room scent disapated due to there being a too small balcony. I thought that the front desk was nicer to the co-workers then they were to the guests but I talked to the front desk twice so that made no difference to me. The hotel was close to a convienence store, a walgreens and other stores...</p><br>Decent experience<p>Stayed here during Nascar weekend so it was one of the cheapest we could find. Staff was very friendly, more friendly than alot of other places we've stayed at.

The rooms were pretty comfortable, the beds were okay, but VERY COMFY PILLOWS! That was a plus. There was alot of dust in the unit the tv was in. Bathroom was ok, not the best shower head. The a/c didn't work well, it seemed like it blew more warm air than cool. It does have a small refrigerator.

None of the soda machines or ice machines were working. Each floor we went to there was an "out of order" sign. The only vending machine was on the very top floor and it wasn't working either. Hotel staff told us to walk across the street to Walgreens.

There is no casino so the place is fairly quiet, not alot of traffic. The elevators were pretty fast. We didn't eat at the restaurant or use the pool but the temperature of the pool was on the gate and it did look appealing.

Not a huge parking lot and no security but we never really felt unsafe. Stayed on the 6th floor and left our balcony door open each night. Our room was on the backside of hotel.

There was some noise each evening from construction being done at the Wynn, which is right across the back of the hotel. The Stardust was also being imploded and you could see it from the hotel. No complaints about seeing something like that, though, it was pretty cool. Other than the construction there wasn't a whole lot of noise. The streets were pretty quiet for it being Vegas, but it is really just a couple blocks from the strip.</p><br>Quiet and convenient<p>The Royal Resort was a great base from which to explore the Las Vegas
Strip. It is located a quick 1-2 minute walk from the strip, near the
north end (just South of the Riviera). We found we could easily walk to most places. It took us less than ten minutes to get to the Wynn or the Fashion Show Mall, for example. There is also a Deuce bus
stop close by, but the nearest monorail stop is a fair distance.

The hotel itself is pretty basic, but the rooms were clean and quiet.
The staff was very friendly and we never had to wait to get service at the front desk (checking in and out was a breeze!). We booked through a timeshare, so I'm not sure what the nightly rates are like.
I would guess you can find cheaper places, but if you want something small and quiet, it might be worth a few extra bucks to stay here. The pool is small, but we never found it to be busy. The cabanas are free to use.

There are numerous restaurants nearby. We were on a pretty tight budget, so we made good use of the food court in the Riviera and the MacDonalds across the street. There is also a 24 hour Walgreens right across the street, which was great for snacks and anything else we needed.

Overall, this is a great alternative to the larger hotels. There's no casino, meaning you can just walk into the hotel and up to your room (no navigating the crowds). It isn't fancy, but it defnitely suited our needs. We had a great time!</p><br>Very Pleased<p>We really liked our stay at Royal Resort in Vegas. The lobby was newly updated, it is a very quite place. No casino but who needs it when they are everywhere in Vegas. I was pleasantly surprised by the place I have read the other reviews here and it was a mix of both good and bad but we really enjoyed our stay. We did not smell anything in the hallways and our room had a nice deck off of it. We were on the second floor but the other floors decks are very small. It was nice to get away from all the excitment of vegas and go to our room and relax. The room was the typical size of a hotel room the bathroom a little small but was big enough to do what you needed to do. Had almost a full size fridge w/freezer, had a microwave and a table and two chairs on the deck. The pool is nothing fancy but it wasn't busy either so it was nice to be able to actually swim. My husband loved the Cosmo resturant's tuna melt said " It was the best he ever had". I had breakfast there and it was pretty good and the price was not bad either. We really enjoyed our week long stay at the Royal. It is only 1/2 to 1 block from the strip and across the street was Wallgreens which was very nice to have since it ended up being 117 degrees! The staff was friendly, the maids were very accomadating with our sleep schedule. We didn't have anyone asking us to tour or buy a timshare. I loved the location and would defiently come back here again.</p><br>Open door slowly....<p>We decided to do a last minute Vegas trip on 7/7/7 where everyone are in vegas to get marry or gamble! Anyways, we booked our room thru my friend's timeshare since this trip was not plan and everything was so expensive during the holiday.
I've stayed at Royal Resort 2 other times (Jan 2005 & June 2005) without problems. If you're not too fuzzy & just staying one night or two in Vegas this hotel is not too shabby. It is about five min walk to Wynn and there is a Walgreens across
the street if u need anything.
however, this time when I was given the keycard to my room
I realized the previous guests had NOT checked out yet! Stuffs were all over the bathroom and their luggages on the floor. It was a good thing
those guests was not in the room or else it would had been pretty embarrassing. As we were on our way back to the elevator, a maid asked us if we found our room OK. When we told her what happened, she was 1/2 laughing and said, "don't worry, this is NOT the 1st time this has happened!" o boy!
Anyways, the guy at the reception apologized and gave us another room right away. He did called security to check on that previous room to make sure eveything is OK. so just a word of pre-caution, go into your room slowly to make sure no one is in there!!</p><br>Not so impressed<p>Okay, this place is good if you just want a cheap place to lay your head for the night, but dont plan on enjoying yourself too much while you are here. First of all, I would like to say that their restraunt there sucks. It is expensive (especially for the amount and QUALITY that you get) and they are super stingey! I went down the night after we had eaten there to ask for a spoon (yes, a plain old PLASTIC spoon) to eat leftovers from another place with, and they told me that it was 50 cents...that is balogna as fas as i am concerned! I didnt have 50 cents with me, and decided it was not worth it to come back down and especially with the way they treated me like i was less because i was a woman or something. anywase, that is the restraunt, and other than that, the place is just pretty lame. we had to ask for another room, because in the bathroom, the bathtub plug (the WHOLE metal piece) was just hanging there, and looked very dangerous, especially since we had 2 babies that needed baths. i was NOT going to let my babies in that bath! It definately needs refurbishing too...way oldschool! and not in a good way! they had flatscreen tv's but let me tell you, the picture in both our first and second room was terrible...they just bought those so they could sound like they are up with the times, but they bought them straight from who knows where that doesnt know how to make tv's. okay, so that is about all i am going to say...just stay somewhere else is what i suggest. they are a wanna be nice place....but they need a lot of work before they will ever be a nice place, in a physical way, and a customer service way.</p><br></body></html>
