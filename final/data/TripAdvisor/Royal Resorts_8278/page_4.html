con: upgrade TV's and one cup coffee maker. otherwise good place to stay!</p><br>Very Helpful Staff<p>We did an overnight in Vegas on our way to Hawaii. I booked a room at the Royal Resort in Vegas on line. Got a very good price. The service was excellent. They got us in our room early as we had flown most of the day. And helped us get our plane boarding tickets printed out. I can't say enough about the staff. Getting there from the airport was a little hassle as the cab driver going to the hotel chose a few more streets than necessary but the return trip was strait to the airport. Otherwise a very good experience.
Room Tip: We were on the 5th floor facing the pool. Was a really nice room

WiFi was $10 a day, so go over to the Fashion Mall or to Denny's for free WiFi. It will probably be demolished for a future mega development.</p><br>Uneven service, cleanliness made second visit disappointing<p>I first stayed at this hotel in 2015 during NAB and had a great experience. I encouraged my co-workers to book at Royal Resort and our collective experiences were disappointing.

I had material delivered to the hotel in advance for the NAB show, and had spoken with the manager directly. She had informed me it may be possible to check in early. When I arrived, the receptionist was extremely rude. No hello, no welcome. She refused to look at the schedule to see if a room was cleaned and would not assist with either the checking of my bag or the box that I was anticipating. My boss informed me she had been equally as rude to him the previous day when he checked in.

The bell hop actually assisted me, finding a room that was cleaned that I could check into. I was in this room for five nights and was conscious about reusing towels and making my bed a few times during the stay as to save water. However, surfaces did not get cleaned in the bathroom or around the mini fridge, and the carpet was never vacuumed. Some other co-workers informed me they didn't receive fresh towels.

I also found the flat pillows to be jarring to the neck, and the mattress pads bunched up during the evenings. While the room was quiet, my sleep wasn't restful.

While I enjoy the late schedule for the pool and hot tub as well as the ten minute walk to the convention center, I don't believe I'll be returning to this hotel next year.
Room Tip: Ask for a back facing room.
See more room tips</p><br>Anniversary vacation<p>Huge problem with baggage cart. They have 3 for the whole resort. Did not find one in in a weeks stay. Even after complaining at the front desk about it, there was still no cart, or offers to help us with our baggage when we carried our own baggage. Quick check in, and out. The room was clean. The swimming pool is very warm.</p><br>Still a good choice since 2013<p>I first reviewed this hotel in 2013 and have been returning every year since then for a yearly convention.

The hotel and service remain very good. The internet still slows to a crawl during the convention.

This year we were put into a 'studio suite'. The front desk explained that these are time share properties that are rented out as hotel rooms because they weren't booked by the timeshare owner. They would be called "Superior Rooms" if booked on the internet.

Note that the "superior" rooms are exactly the same as the normal rooms except that instead of a sofa, there is a fold down "murphy bed" on the wall.

The normal rooms are better.

Access to food got worse now that Tacos El Gordo on the corner has moved elsewhere in town.
Room Tip: Rooms on the north side don't get as hot during the day.
See more room tips</p><br>do not book through kayak/getaroom<p>whatever you do, do not book lodging here through kayak.com or getaroom.com, to whom kayak actually hands off the transaction. i paid in full two months in advance for two rooms. i called the front desk ahead to check and got confusing information. i called getaroom, who told me they called royal to straighten it out. then, when we arrived, i was told they had one room for my party and were sold out for the week. i got my people checked into the one room immediately available and settled in for a stressful wait.

i'll say this clearly: this is a disappointing level of customer service from both getaroom and royal.

it seems to be a systems problem of communication between the two organizations, not one person's random screw-up.

royal resort, a.k.a. royal suites, is a timeshare, not a hotel. maybe they shouldn't rent rooms at all.

kayak? you're huge and your flight search tool rocks. people booking travel online is an actual thing now---one computer talks to another, you take my money, i have rooms for my people--it should just work.

the front desk people dealt with the matter calmly and professionally. i believe they had to bump someone else to ultimately provide me the lodging i'd paid for. based on whatever inaccurate information they had, they oversold their facility.

i actually like the facilities well enough--a little scuffed but not gross--and i really like the location for attending conferences at the convention center. travelling on business,

but ugh. i might take my lodging business elsewhere next year. i will do anything but book through kayak/getaroom.</p><br>Not ideal<p>Came with friends for spring break & booked way too late. I thought price was reasonable considering it's just off the strip. However, beds were hard, I could feel springs in my back. The worst part of all was the chirping from our vent... Sounded like a dying bird. That annoying sound was unbearable. Aside from the negative, the front desk was very polite & there was plenty of parking. The room seemed clean but I didn't dare inspect enough as I just wanted somewhere to sleep and shower. The area is convenient & I felt safe. I would only recommend if you drink heavily to not hear all the noise around you and need a place to shower. Otherwise, not ideal for families or anyone who plans to spend a lot of time in the room. They charge for wi-fi but at least give you a refrigerator? I do not plan to return, there are too many better deals in town.</p><br>Comfort &amp; Convenience<p>I was pleasantly surprised after reading other reviews thought it would be way off the strip but is actualy only a 10 minute walk to the Wynn. The building does need remodeling, rugs in particular, but it is well kept and clean. The staff & front desk were very accomodating with all our requests. Very convenient having Vegas.com in the lobby as well for gettting show tickets. The Barrymore cool little bar/restaurant on site, great happy hour prices and creative appetizers. There is a Walgreens and Denney's on the corner that is convenient for drinks and snacks. Do check out the Peppermill Restaurant a 3 minute walk up LV Blvd toward the Stratosphere, a great find for meals and a really cool separate bar with a fire pit. For those who don't prefer to walk the cab to Treasure Island is under $7 but the strip is easily walkable and you don't get to see the sites from a car. I would definitely stay here again! If I had a negative it would be that they charge for wifi $10 a day, doesn't really make sense!
Room Tip: We stayed on the third floor facing the pool #303 - perfect awesome view of the Encore/Wynn and the...

Our car was broken into the first night and all they would do was quote corporate policy. After repeatedly being attacked by roaches on the second night we had to leave for a 2 star hotel that was 10 times better than this dump and they still did not give me a refund.</p><br></body></html>
