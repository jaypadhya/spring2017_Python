<html><head><h3>Royal Resort, Las Vegas Reviews Page 18</h3></head><body><br>Quiet budget hotel.<p>You don't feel like you're in Vegas in this hotel, which as GREAT for us as we go there to do outdoor adventure and so the hotel is an arrival and departure night stop-over. It's a very small hotel with free parking just outside the door, the lobby is awesome with a nice lounge, artwork, old-fashioned games and live pianist some evenings. The rooms are small, the balconies are dangerous (small children are definite problem!), and the air-conditioning is non-existent. But, we will stay there again because it's off the strip but close enough, the pool and hot tub are very nice, and Denny and Walgreens are right across the street. But the best thing is there are no slot machines, flashing lights, loud music or crowds! And at $30 to $50 a night, the price is right.
Room Tip: The rooms overlooking the street have slightly wider, and therefore less dangerous, balconies.

However, these are not suites. This is an old hotel. The rooms have a smell that only went away because we kept our slider open most of the time. The cleaning staff does keep the rooms and rest of the place clean. Microwave & fridge was only available in rooms that had a Murphy bed according to front desk. Waking distance to strip but you have to go by a somewhat scary area. Women pick another place to stay.</p><br>What a joke!<p>Just stayed here for a week and was appalled by this place. The walls in this place are so thin you can literaly listen to the conversations of the people in the next room like you were sitting next to them. The first night we were awoke at 430 am and treated to enough infomation from our neighbors and their fun uses for peanut butter than I want to know about anyone.(and the ac would not work). The next morning we asked to be moved and suprisingly accomodated. O.K. now things would get better right? We then decided to go out to the pool and catch some sun, only to find that they have only 4 (four) thats right 4 lounge chairs for the whole hotel and they were all full, so to our delight we would have to lay on the cement or lay in one of their grungy looking love seats that they tossed out by the pool area. When asked if they had more chairs my wife was told they were lent to their other property the prior week and they had not gotten around to picking them up. After 4 days of not having anything change about this problem I went to the front desk and asked and was told " we only have the 4 chairs, thats all we carry here." Did I miss something here? Look, I own two lounge chairs,live in Washington State and don't own a pool and have only 2 less lounge chairs then they do. Anyway still trying to make the best of this we see a card in our room that they had Happy hour from 5pm to 8pm in ther bar so we decide to grab a coctail before going to dinner except the bartender tells us they don't have HH. We tell him its advertised in our room only to be told we need a coupon to get the HH pricing. Thinking I might have missed the small print on the ad we just pay regular price and go to dinner. When we returned to the room I look at the ad and it says nothing about needing any stinkin coupon. The next day we talk to the front desk about this and we are given coupons for buy one get one coupons during HH So we head back over to the bar (different bartender) ask him about HH and he tells us there is no HH. This time however, I have the ad from our room and toss it on the bar for him to look at. He tells me he still knows nothing about it,texts his boss to check and tells us still no hh but will give us the HH price. Oh,did i mention the bum I almost ran over laying by the building the second day we were there or that you can get into the hotel thru the back door without using you key card because the card reader does'nt work? This is one of the worst run hotels I have ever seen and I have stayed in quite a few around the world. Obviously no communication from managment to employees or concern about customer service. So go ahead and stay here if you want, but don't say you haven't been warned!
Room Tip: stay elsewhere

When we arrived, we were pleasantly surprised with our accommodations. The location was very convenient to the strip; and Walgreens, Denny's, and Ross were right across the street. Our 4th floor studio room had a small frig and microwave with shelf space to hold groceries, and the vanity had cabinet space to store our things while there. Our king sized bed was comfortable and if we needed it, there was also a queen sized Murphy bed. The room was clean with newer carpet and tile, and when we requested extra linens, we were immediately given some. We didn't use the pool or hot tub, but talked to several people who said they were very nice. The staff was pleasant and even helped us print our boarding passes before we left. Since our flight was at 11 pm, and check out was around 10am, they offered to store our luggage so we could continue to enjoy the activities in the area. Except for hearing music a few nights we were there, we had a very nice stay.
Room Tip: Rooms on the 4th floor have apparently recently been renovated

This weekend's schedule included two nights of live entertainment in the back parking lot. Guests were running up and down the halls banging on the doors of misc. rooms until 4AM. I have stayed at this location a few times, and this was a surprise to our group.
Room Tip: Choose a room facing the North side of the building.

When checking in was a little concerned look like a huge party was going on but thought as long as it wasnt going on in my room, I would be fine. Got to the room and opened my curtains to a Carnival literally 20 feet off the balcony. With Ferris Wheel and Fire breathing Grasshopper. Called down to the front desk and asked if we could be moved to the front of the hotel and was told they were full. Decided to make the best of it. We walked the strip and had dinner. When we got back to our room at midnight the Carnival and Bands were still going on. Call down to the front desk and we were told by security that it would be over at 1am. Finally at 2 am the Carnival ended. Then the party moved inside. I guess our room was right over the bar so the rest of the night we sleep in a speaker box. Caledl security several times and even had the security guy come and apologize. But we were told that they had not control and could not end the party. Appartently there are to people running the hotel end and others running the party bar. It seems like the Manager of the Party Bar is the winner. Maybe better sales with liquor then renting rooms. Finally around 5 am the Music ended and we could 2 hours of sleep before we had to be up. When we check out in the morning We were told by the Sunday Manager that it was not his problem and he did not book the event. He looked straight at me and said "Do you think I had any control over that". This Hotel does not own anything. Hands down I will NEVER stay here again and will warn anyone the is thinking about it. They definately have the wrong man for the manager on Sunday Morning.
Room Tip: Dont Stay here!
See more room tips</p><br>DO NOT stay at this hotel!<p>I previously stood at this hotel about 5 years ago and had a very pleasant experience. I loved being a couple mins away from the strip, so that when i returned to my hotel i could have some piece and quiet. HOWEVER my stay recently was a hell storm of rude workers, LOUD party music that went on ALL weekend, and HORRIBLE maid service. 1 - this hotel constantly throws parties poolside and NEVER tells the guest. (I couldn't use the pool, and there was OVERLY LOUD music ALL NIGHT right outside my window.) 2 - The service here is POOR, the staff is rude, and there is NO MAID service! 3 - You get what you pay for. With as many Hotel choice as you do in Vegas you shouldn't have to stay at such a crap MOTEL.
Room Tip: Stay at the Stratoshpere or Circus Circus if your with your family. If your in Vegas you SHOULD stay...

Free parking, very nice modern lobby, sometimes they even have a pianist. Restaurant looked surprisingly stylish although I didn't try it out. Rooms were dated and drab but large. Bed was very comfortable. If you are on a budget and don't want a casino hotel then this place is a good choice. I've stayed here twice when I've been working over here and I will probably make it my default, budget, vegas spot.</p><br>Great Hotel Right Next To The Strip<p>I spent three nights at the hotel while in Vegas for a conference. The hotel was in an absolutely perfect location, within a few minutes walk of the Strip without all the hustle. It was very clean and the staff were all very friendly. The bed was incredibly comfortable, I had a cracked rib and still managed a reasonable nights sleep. My room had a view overlooking the pool and the Strip (if that's what turns you on). I really appreciated my bedroom having a sliding door that allowed fresh air and the sun in.

The breakfast on offer at Barrymore's restaurant attached to the hotel was perfect for me, but I can see that it would be seen as inadequate compared to the average sized breakfast on offer in the US. Also I would have liked a check-out later than mid-day but this was not possible.
Room Tip: Ask for a south facing room overlooking the strip.
See more room tips</p><br>Las Vegas' hidden gem!<p>This place surprised me! I couldn't believe we got such an affordable place right off the main strip!! There was a small bar in the lobby & very nice pool, & hot tub, with pool side wait staff! The rooms weren't extravagant, but were very very nice, clean & comfortable! But don't expect the Belaggio! When we go back to Vegas, we have decided we will definitely be staying here again!</p><br></body></html>
