Restaurant with no customers in it at 4pm, clue #5. we signed up for a talk that afternoon. we went up to our room, very chilly and smelled like orange cleaner, clue #6. we thought, how nice they were cleaning diligently....only vacuumed around edges of bed, very dirty underneath and behind. we went to the timeshare sales pitch, very nice older man, former school teacher. he asked us if there was any smell left in our room??? hmmmm back to clue #6. we told him we were not interested but i wanted to see where this tower was going to be built and when, he walked us to the window, said the pool would be closed in 2 weeks and that construction would begin on the tower. i asked him where the equipment was for the contruction, he pointed to a pickup truck and a small pile of dirt and said, yep they're getting started, clue #7 (i'm an engineer, there was no tower getting started in 2 weeks). he passed us on to a youngish mafia type man in a french shiny suit with slicked back hair for higher pressure. finally, we were passed to the older mafia father for the final pressure. luckily we resisted! we went out that night and returned at 10p, very few lights in any rooms, clue #8. very cold in the room still. my husband turned off the air. after 10 minutes, he turned and asked if i had 'passed gas', i in turn said it must have been him that did it. clue #9, the smell had returned once the air was turned off, very very bad sewer smell- we had to turn the air back on to sleep. the next morning we went down to the lobby and i noticed a large poster on an easel touting the MaMa Mia Dinner Show at the hotel. Clue #10. i asked at the front desk (right next to the easel) how to get tickets for the show. the clerks looked at each other and said they knew nothing about it and told me to ask the man dressed as 'don juan' nearby. clue #11 i asked him and he said it was 'temporarily postponed' while they are doing a major marketing campaign for the new tower. hmmmm. i asked when it would run again and he said in 2 weeks, common theme.... when we got back to our own home, the friend asked us how the tower was coming along, she had purchased a timeshare about a year earlier and was told the tower construction would start in.......you guessed it.....2 weeks. run, don't walk away from this deal....</p><br>What is that smell?<p>April 1st 2005, Forced to stay here for lack of options (Friday night & no rooms available elsewhere). Paid $150 for the one night as opposed to the usual $35. Got to the 6th floor hallway and the smell immediatly transported me back to my childhood when my father would leave the door open to the bathroom after "reading" for an hour. The topper was returning home and finding an additional $25 fee for something charged to my account. The only upside to my trip to Vegas was the Mariners beat the Cubs 5-4. Good thing I didn't stay for the second game or there would be no upside.</p><br>Under rated<p>This, I found, is a very nice place with good rates. It was quiet, clean and seemed to be recently remodled. Short walk to the Stardust, Westward Ho, Circus-Circus and Frontier. Pool was very nice and quiet. Self parking is handy. A nice touch is the fact the patio doors in the rooms open up and you can stand outside and look over the rail. Not really a balcony, but close enough for Vegas.</p><br>When I didn't buy their timeshare, they threatened to call the cops!<p>Me and a friend were staying at a nearby hotel. While walking along the strip, we were stopped and promised hundreds of dollars in slot machine playing money if we would only sit through a time-share sales pitch for The Royal Resort.

We were promised, 'If you don't want to buy, just tell them "No thank you" and you 'll receive your playing money.' We thought it would be interesting to sit through... perhaps learn aboug the Vegas development. We were told that only females could buy into their hotel. My friend qualified. I accompanied her through the process.

At the end of the pitch, we repeatedly said "No thank you." The management didn't like this. He approached me about my own qualifications and income level. (I was a student.) This was not relevant, and I told him so. He told me I fraudulently misrepresented myself. I made no representations whatsoever; this pitch wasn't even meant for me.

When I got upset, they called security and threatened to call the police. Instead of getting hundreds of dollars in slot machine playing money, we got cupons for a buffet. At least the security guard was friendly: he told us that this happens about once per week. Don't go near this hotel.</p><br>Don't get out much...<p>Anyone who thinks this is a nice hotel,apparently doesn't get out much.This place has been a dump for years.
Casino!They had one once years ago but lost their gaming license..
Good prices can always be had at "NICE" strip hotels.Look for them...</p><br>I enjoyed my stay<p>I stayed here in July and was pleasantly surprised. I had never heard of the place but my girlfriend and I were in a tight spot - rooms were scarce and overpriced. Royal Resort was affordable and we dont spent too much time in the room since we're 23. We didnt mind that the casino wasn't open. The room was very very nice. That's a big bonus when I'm headed to Vegas looking for bargain hotels.</p><br>Pleasantly surprised<p>Recent reviews led to me doubting my recent hotel choice, but was pleasantly surprised by what turned out to be a good 50 buck a night choice. Having stayed in Vegas over 15 times in the past, I've sampled both good and bad. The Royal was very good. Stylish, clean, well appointed, comfortable room (presumably recently refurbished), friendly, helpful staff. The pool area is very pleasant, with constant exposure to the sun, though there is slight building noise emanating from adjacent apartment development. Talking of which, the Royal is clearly it's sales base, though it's completely unobtrusive. So, if want you are looking for is a good, clean, no frills hotel, the Royal is a great choice.</p><br>Comdex 2002<p>Stayed at this hotel while attending the Comdex 2002. The exhibition centre is a stone-throw away and in walking-distance. Quite pleasant to take little walk in the morning. The rooms are nice, and the queen-size beds were well-kept. The batroom was adequate. The tub was quite small (american standard??). The hot-water was barely body-temperature, and I found it quite annoying not to be able to have a really hot shower in a week... The AC worked very well, almost to well. Although spending a few hours in all with the AC-control panel, the AC still made the room very cold at nights. Maybe it's an american thing. Me being european would have a appreciated a more sedate temperature. The hotel itself has a small casiono (it's really a row with slotmachines only), so the noise-level is quite comfortable. Also there is a small bar and a small giftshop. The hotel has an ATM in a corner, which was very practical.
The staff were ok. I appreciate the help of the staff at the desk when I and my wife had some problems booking a Grand Canyon-tour, since none of us are native english-speakers, and american-english tends to be not as brittish-english... The food needs to be mentioned specially when travelling in the US, and you're an european. The meals are BIG and fatty. After having breakfast at the Peppermill across the street from the hotel, we usually didn't have anything else for the rest of the day. It was so big and filling... Also, since the food is very fatty, sensitive persons may display digestive-problems... When we left the hotel at the end of the Comdex, they began refurnishing the lobby.
There may be more slotmachies and stuff. Overall the hotell was average.</p><br>Nice, quiet, inexpensive<p>I go to Las Vegas every year for a conference and I've stayed at the Royal for the past 8 years. I've found the staff extremely friendly and helpful. It's a very small hotel.. just off the strip and close to the convention center. If you want the MGM go there. If you want a nice, quiet inexpensive hotel the Royal is the place.</p><br>Pleasantly Surprised<p>Well. My friend and I had read some bad reviews and were a bit nervous.
But our wonderful experience started with a friendly staff. We had driven all night and they allowed us to check in several hours early.
They were so kind. The lobby is gorgeous. Recently remodeled. My favorite part: no casino. It was nice to get away from the noise. Our room was beautiful. New carpet, bedding, furniture, tile, everything.
They have done an excellent job updating the property. We at breakfast at Table Tops and it was yummy. Not so crazy expensive either. Perfect location!!! We will make this a yearly trip with this property.</p><br></body></html>
