You can tell that the place is just a $ maker for the people that work there, and very little consideration is given to it's guests. Be careful for what they say, and make sure you get it in writting, and read the small print, or have a lawyer review anything you get from them.</p><br>Yuck!<p>We stayed at the Royal Hotel and Casino for one night to many. We were schedualed to come in at 10PM and made it to the hotel an hour early butfinding it was the hard part. I called from a cell phone and got the front desk and asked where they were located when i finnally got directions I found that we were directed to what looked like a hotel under construction. I recalled the hotels front desk and asked if they were under construction and they said no, so we thought that we were at the wrong spot. When we finally figured it out I let the front desk know that incase anyone else asked they were under construction. Even though we were not impressed with the outside of the hotel the lobby was nice so we figured that the hotel would be nice. OOPs big mistake! The room smelled and had paper thin walls... thank you people next door for giving us a wonderful rated X audio play by play. The sheets looked like they had been slept in, the tub had mold growing on it and it looked like someone had smoked in the room for 20 years before we got there. The next day we went to the front desk to ask for a new room and it took 30 min for anyone to even make it around to the front desk for us to ask. We got nothing but rudeness from the hotel desk people and decided that it was over for us, so instead of getting a new room we grabbed our bags and went out the door. Leaving a key and an explination to the manager that we would never be back. The one good thing that we can say about the hotel is that we didnt get charged for the nights that we didnt stay. The only other thing that came out of this hotel was that the Ameria Suites that is down the road was cheeper, cleaner, and offered us a more restful nights sleep after a rough day of sight seeing. Thank you Ameria Suits.</p><br>Great Location and Nice Place to stay at<p>I really enjoyed this place overall. I was there on the 4th of July weekend and when we got there we were upgraded for no reason to a studio. It was cool. We took to of my sisters and my husband and I and they even gave us some rollaways for the couple of nights that we were there for no extra charge. The pool is quiet and clean. Nothing fancy but I really like the cabanas that they have there.We took mixed drinks and were in the pool most of the time. There are only about 4 cabanas total, but it was basically first come first served. Overall, the location is really convenient and for the price you can't be too demanding. Weekend price is good compared to other places.</p><br>The worst hotel stay of our lives<p>Went to Vegas April 2003. Don't let the name fool you, there is no casino at this location. Got a great (so I thought) package deal to stay at this hotel (as long as we would sit through their "time share", what a mistake! This was the worst hotel stay of our lives! From the moment of check in to check out the staff was extremely rude. We had a better room at the Westward Ho, than this place. We had to ask 3 times for the coffee pot and coffee that was supposed to come with the room, when we did they made it very clear on how inconvenient this was. My husband is a smoker, they also failed to let us know when we booked it that this is a non-smoking hotel (they even asked if we wanted a smoking or non-smoking room), if he wanted to smoke he had to go downstairs and outside to do so. Also, there was supposed to be a continental breakfast every morning of our stay, however upon check in the clerk "didn't know anything about that". We found out at our time-share (the last day we were there, that it was on the second floor. We went to breakfast at their restaurant table talk cafe. There was only 1 other couple in the entire place. It took over an hour to get eggs and sausage for him, and an omelet for me. When it finally came out (as we were getting ready to leave) it was so cold neither of us could choke it down. My husband and I have never complained or thought of walking out of a restaurant until that day, I complained to the manager and at least we didn't have to pay for the breakfast. Then went into their little store that they have there, and there was a foreigner buying stamps and asking how much the stamps were and how many it would take to mail a postcard (she explained she didn't know our system). The gentleman in the store took advantage of this, had her buy 6 stamps and charged her 50 cents for each 36 cent stamp. When I said something to him behind her in line, he about went nuts on me, (at least I got a thank you from the customer and I directed her to Walgreens assumintic, didn't think we would be out of our room for long so I had left my inhalers and nebulizer in our room. Little did I know upon our return to the room (because I was having a hard time breathing), our key would not work. After going to the front desk and finally getting someone to come to the desk, they did call security to try to get the lock open. When security was unable to do so, (after an hour). They said we'll put you in another room as we don't want to have to call maintenance in this time of night (we had explained several times that it was medically necessary for me to get into the room and why). They finally called their maintenance guy in after my husband fought with them for almost 30 minutes demanding that they get someone in here now! It then took maintenance another hour to get the door open! When we apologized to our neighbors the next morning for all of the noise, and told them what had happened they were completely understanding and had stated that their stay had been absolutely horrible as well! Then during the time share, we had told them everything that had happened, all they had to say was, well at least you didn't die (which was definitely a possibility). Then they offered us a free stay for our wedding party (we have friends getting married in July out there and are going back to Las Vegas then) if we would buy their time share! I couldn't believe their nerve! If they gave me a time share or even a completely free trip to Las Vegas I would never stay at this hotel again! I wouldn't send my worst enemy there! Beware, this place is a nightmare!</p><br>super sympa<p>situé au bout su strip, acceuil chaleureux, chambre spacieuse, lit gigantesque ! nous avions vu sur la rue mais de l'autre coté c'est vue sur piscine et l'hotel "encore".
Pret de serviettes pour la piscine. piscine très agréable aprèsa avoir affronté la chaleur extérieure !
chambre propre si on oubli le dessus de lit très viellot et les rideaux pleins de poussière. bon rapport qualité /prix.
gros bémol: WIFI payant ! 15 dollars pour 2 jours!!</p><br>Bom custo-benefício<p>O Royal Resort Hotel é um hotel já antigo e está localizado bem próximo da strip (parte mais ao norte). Está a alguns metros do CIrcus Circus, Encore & Wynn Hotel e o também antigo Riviera. Sua localização é boa, possui um Walgreens (farmácia e outros produtos), ROSS (roupas), Dennys e um 7evelen no pequeno "mall" bem em frente ao hotel, o que dispensa deslocamento de carros para coisas mais urgentes. De forma geral, os quartos são bem limpos e espaçosos com cama confortável. Não possui casino no hotel o que evita o cheiro forte de cigarro e também não cobra a "enjoada" taxa de resort que a maioria dos hotéis cobram. EU particularmente gostei da opção de pagar toda estadia no check-in (cash ou cartão). O custo benefício foi excelente.

O que deixou a desejar na minha opinião foi:
WIFI pago a um preço bem salgado (por dia). Os quartos são um tanto velhos (eu não me incomodo com isso, até porque passei pouco tempo dentro do quarto). Os funcionários foram solícitos porém muito secos, sem muita conversa. Não possui café da manhã.
Room Tip: Andares superiores e afastados dos elevadores.

Super lækker opvarmet pool og Spa.
Gratis kaffe i receptionen fra kl 7 morgen.
Dejlig stort værelse og lækre senge.
Meget smilende og hjælpsomme i receptionen.</p><br>Einfaches kleines Hotel am Strip<p>Das Royal Resort ist ein kleines Hotel am Strip mit welchem wir sehr zufrieden waren.

Es bietet gute Zimmer, einen anständigen Pool und auch das Fitnesscenter kann sich sehen lassen.
Für das Auto sind genügend kostenfreie Parkplätze verfügbar und ein schneller und einfacher Checkin ist vorhanden (zu beachten ist, dass eine Kaution von 100 Dollar hinterlegt werden muss)

Leider gibt es am Ende nur 4 von 5 Sternen, da WLAN für 10 Dollar pro Tag zugekauft werden müsste, wenn benötigt und sowas muss einfach gratis sein.</p><br>Preis und Lage sind top!<p>Das Royal Resort liegt fast direkt am Strip und ist ein reines Hotel - also kein Casino = keine Resortgebühren. Es ist alles etwas in die Jahre gekommen, aber das ist nicht so schlimm. Das Personal ist nett und es ist sauber. Die Eingangshalle sieht nett aus und rings herum gibt es gleich Einkaufsmärkte und Restaurants. Parken kann man direkt am Hotel und es gibt einen Pool. Leider wird für das WLAN eine Gebühr verlangt. Wir hatten noch einen ganz netten Ausblick auf den Pool und auf das Encore-Resort.
Und der Preis auch am Wochenende ist einfach toll.</p><br>Muy buen precio<p>Gran ubicación. Delante tiene la conveniencia Dennys, etc. Las habitaciones son grandes y limpias, sin olor a cigarrillo. Los puntos débiles son la iluminación de la habitación. Se puede reservar con desayuno incluido</p><br></body></html>
