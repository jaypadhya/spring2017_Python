<html><head><h3>Royal Resort, Las Vegas Reviews Page 3</h3></head><body><br>Good value comfortable stay<p>Had a very nice stay at Royal Resort, location to the strip was ideal. Pool and hot tub were very nice, good size and clean. Rooms well furnished and friendly staff. Only issue was that you had to pay for wifi, in 2015 really?! (We just used McDonolds across the street).</p><br>Good value for the money<p>So i paid 50$ for a room at the hotel... Good location, nice pool, very clean and quit, steps away from the Strip, free parking
I would definitely recomend the hotel
The only con-the wifi is not free but.. U are in vegas to party</p><br>Decent place to stay on a budget<p>Priceline picked this hotel for me. I was a little worried about staying here, but overall, it was a decent place to stay at, especially at the price that I paid. Friendly staff at front desk, check in was quick, she honored my request a room away from the elevators. Bed and pillows were comfortable, good shower pressure and hot water. Free parking and easy to get in and out of the hotel. No free Wi-Fi, they charge for it, which is a bummer in this day of age. Also disappointed the pool was not working in the hot month of July. AC worked well, was quiet, and I had a pretty good sleep here. Also, it was nice to have a fridge and microwave in the room.</p><br>A clean room to sleep in - No frills<p>We stayed in the "Superior" rooms. The hotel room and the property were pretty basic. If you only need a clean room with few amenities, this property will suit you. Superior room had a dorm-sized fridge, microwave, and coffee maker. Room could sleep 3 comfortably when using the Murphy bed. Small table with 2 chairs, and one "easy chair". That's it. Pool was being repaired as of date of our stay (7/25/15). No restaurant, bar, or casino. Easy walk to north end of Strip. Within 1/2 mile walk of Encore, Wynn, Palazzo, Venetian, and Fashion Show Mall. Staff was wonderful to work with. Only drawback was total lack of amenities, so had to go off-site to eat. Wi-fi is extra $10 per day/per device. Also had to leave $100 deposit (refundable at checkout) per room for incidental charges.</p><br>Poor condition<p>The hotel is part of our timeshare network. The air conditioning was not working, sinks were clogged, pool was out of order, and service was horrible.

While the price is right, the hotel needs a good upgrade.</p><br>Ok for the money...<p>We arrived slightly early as we had landed earlier than expected so we tried our luck at checking in early. Staff at the reception allowed us to check in early but the young male member of staff was not very welcoming or talkative when we asked about various things.

Our room was quite dated and old looking. We were given a twin room, although we had asked for a double so we ended up having our own beds. The aircon was on the blink and very loud. The shower and bathroom facilities were not up to scratch, taking me 10 minutes to wash the soap out of my hair! The decor and general state of the room is in desperate need of modernising in order to match the trendy looking lobby and the nice expensive restaurant situated downstairs. The pool area was lovely, although it was due to close on the Monday due to a refurb.

The location is brilliant, although we could only walk halfway up the strip because of it being a bit too far out but we were happy exploring up to this point as we were staying at the top end of the strip at the end of our holiday anyway.

I probably won't stay here again due to experiencing other parts of the strip but if you are looking for a budget hotel which is in walking distance of the strip, give it a go.
Room Tip: Go for a room at the top. The views from the balcony is either a busy road or a car park but the roo...

On the 6th I took a.letter to be mailed to my son with cash in it no one knew I put it in folded paper so you could not see what was in it but funny as.of today it has not arrived a week later I'm home and no letter yet.pool we could not use they said they would make arrangements for us to. Use a pool at another place asked several times no one. New what was going on with that. And. no restaurant yesterday really bad deal for the money I recommending it to others not to go there. RUDY,LAURIE. ZAMORA</p><br>Good price<p>We booked the hotel for a good price. When we arrived in 115 degrees, we were informed that the pool was out of order. Very disapointing. After talking to the manager and the managers manager we got internet for free, as ompensation. Nice.

There is no resort fee, which is very nice, but you have to pay (10 dollars! I think) for internet then.
The hotel was as good as emty, when we were there. Big parking lot, very close to the Strip. Cleaning ladies did a very good job, the rooms were always very clean and tidy.</p><br>Very good location amazing price<p>I have paid 50$ a night at this hotel one street away from the strip. Very clean and staff amazing. They gave us the room early, around noon which allows us to take a shower. The pool was very clean
There is a shopping center across the street and a walgreen open 24 hours. There is also a 7 eleven and free parking</p><br>Clean property and helpful staff<p>We needed a hotel near the convention center and didn't expect frills due to the cost. We truly just needed a bed and bath and this place was fine. I guess it's always 110+ degrees this time of year so the air was overworked in places, but we got a room change for a cooler floor and all requests-- ironing board and iron and working remore were handled quickly and courteously. It was clean and neat and fine!
Room Tip: Request a lower floor in the summer as heat rises!!!
