I was looking for a good value within walking distance to the Strip and had hoped this would do the trick, given all of the rave reviews I read. Unfortunately, all it did was make me wonder when I became so cheap that I subjected myself and my family to this place! I routinely stay at hotels like Hilton Garden Inn and Holiday Inn Express for work, to give you an idea of what I am used to. This place was HALF the quality of either of those chain hotels, if that. The front desk was inept and totally rude. We were given the wrong room type and then hassled about it, despite it being their error. The room itself was old and run down. It wasn't necessarily dirty, but it definitely didn't feel clean, either. The location was terrific (3 blocks to Treasure Island and 4 to the Venetian), but the area immediately surrounding the hotel was sketchy and of questionable safety at night. It felt like we were relegated to the "bad hotel," after spending the day in the more upscale hotels around the corner. After this experience, I realized I'm worth the $50 it takes to stay somewhere better. May I suggest that you are, too.
Room Tip: Don't try to sleep on the pool side during the day due to a loud DJ atmosphere. Don't try t...

However, the hotel is very close to the strip and easy to get the bus.</p><br>Generally pleasing stay, but not perfect<p>First, here's what I did NOT like about the Royal House/Royal Resort:
1. No one in Vegas knows this place as the "Royal House" (which is its name according to their own website). Instead, everyone knows it as "Royal Resort."
2. No free breakfast of any kind.
3. No free wi-fi (2 doors down is a hotel where you can use wi-fi in their lobby for free, though). I think Royal Resort charges $10 a day or so for wi-fi, which is a rip off.
4. Hallways are noisy and I agree with the person who said it smelled like weed.

If any of these things are dealbreakers for you, you may want to stay elsewhere. However, I enjoyed my stay for all of these reasons:
1. Room was spotless & clean.
2. Pool/hot tub area was beautiful.
3. Nice view from the room.
4. Location was excellent and very convenient.
5. Price was quite affordable compared to the big hotels on the strip.
6. My experience with checking in and out was smooth and easy.
7. I really liked the decor of the lobby and lounge.

I would stay at the Royal Resort again.</p><br>Superb stay and very resonable price<p>we enjoyed our stay at this place a lot.

its located very close to the casinos.

seems like the place has been renovated.

Internet is not free and its only available in the reception area.

But overall i think everything was great for the price we paid which was like 53.35 with taxes on hotels.com.We'll definitely stay here again on our next visit.</p><br>We thought it was fine.<p>From other reviews we pretty much knew what to expect and thought it was a good place stay. We liked staying close to the strip in a non-gaming facility. We called and our room was ready so we were unpacked, made a trip to Walgreens and Strip Liquor and at the pool by 2:00. Yes it was noisy over the weekend but by Monday nice and quiet. We had a studio room so it needed a little more work to truely be called a condo. There is nowhere to do dishes and only one comfy chair and housekeeping was hit and miss. We will stay there again for location, nice pool area and price.</p><br>Clean rooms but paper thin walls<p>I stayed one night in order to take a medical board examination next door at the Pearson center.
I paid $49 for a king suite on a Wednesday night. This was slightly higher than some big name resorts on the strip for a weekday price. (weekdays are ridiculously cheap in Vegas) There was no gotcha resort fees which is rare anymore. The hotel is very close to a boring part of the strip. You will have to walk at least 1 mile to see any action. The room was clean and comfortable. The big problem was paper-thin walls. You can hear people breath next door. No joke. I had to turn the fan on manual to make background noise all night which caused the room to be too cold.
Other than that all was well. So... if you are a sound sleeper and you like the price the hotel is decent. Otherwise this may not be your place.</p><br>Poor Service<p>This hotel is clean and close to the strip. Other than that, my stay at the Royal resort was TERRIBLE! At check in the front desk insisted that our rooms weren't ready despite other guest being able to check in. Our rooms were not cleaned. When we returned to our rooms in the evening I was surprised to see the bed was sloppily made and the bathroom had not been cleaned the only evidence that anyone serviced the room was a new set of towels. While in the hotel the halls smelled like someone was smoking weed. At check out we were surprised to find out we were charged for every face cloth we used to remove make-up with for our entire stay. The Manager was rude and demanding and resorted to insults while we tried to understand the outrageous bill. Please stay somewhere else. Vegas has other hotels that are nicer for the same rate.</p><br>Not like the photos<p>I do NOT recommend. The shower was so nasty looking. The carpet was even more gross. The lobby is nice. The reception desk, the lady just thought I should wait and she finished her work she seem to be behind on. On the weekends there's an active bar scene. However, if you're on the 2nd floor you will hear the noise your room. The parking lot gets full, especially with the people going in to have a drink. This is basically a motel you find on the highway in the middle of nowhere not a resort...what resort features? I checked out after a day and a half. I wanted the hotel that is in the photos. Book here if you're really that cheap, probably better off paying $5-$10 more per night elsewhere, seriously don't be that cheap...nasty shower. Try the Tuscany Suites if you're on a budget</p><br>Actually, It's Called The Royal Resort<p>There's a lot to figure out what's really going on at this property. First of all, I understand from some other guests I talked with, that there are some "larger" rooms in this hotel, but the rooms are definitely very smallish hotel rooms, at least on the 6th (of 7 floors) floor where my rooms was. I saw no suites. The property has definitely been remodeled, and the room I stayed in was redone, clean, and adequate. There is a pool, facing the parking lot, in the rear of the hotel. I reserved the room online from the hotel's website, but bookings and rates do not go through the hotel. When I tried to extend my stay, the front desk indicated that I needed to go back to the hotel website and book again thru that company.

There was no internet in the hotel during my stay. I was told that the hotel had just signed up with a new provider. Suggest you ask if this is a requirement.

I booked the hotel 3 days before a major convention and got an incredible rate of $30.00 per night. Frankly, I was nervous when I showed up. Again, the room was clean, but a very long walk up the street from the LV Convention Center. The other direction is the Strip, about a 1/2 block away. The older Riviera is just around the corner to the North, and the Wynn & Encore are just to the South. Not really in the mainstream of the the Las Vegas Strip, but you're not isolated, either.

If you need a very inexpensive place to stay while visiting in LV and don't need a restaurant onsite, you will probably find that this hotel is just adequate.
Room Tip: There is no bus service on Convention Center Drive. The hotel website is www.royalhotelvegas.com

It was easy to find (just off the strip towards the northern end) and parking is plentiful. It's also an easy walk from the Las Vegas Convention Center, and not having to do battle with the center's parking lot was a big plus. The rooms itself was spotlessly clean, and the bed perfectly comfortable. The only drawbacks with the room were no valuables safe and an extra $10 for wifi, though given the price of the room night the extra ten bucks is hardly worth complaining about. The only thing that really left a sour taste in my mouth was the downright rude check-in clerk. Her English was barely adequate, and she kept trying to suggest that the fact that I'd used an abbreviated form of my first name on the reservation but the full one on my credit card was a problem. "You need to sort this out!" she kept saying, jabbing her finger at me. Eventually she backed down and, after the best part of 15 minutes typing into her PC (with a long line accumulating behind me), gave me the room key, but it wasn't the best start for my stay.
Room Tip: One facing the back of the property will probably be a bit quieter.
