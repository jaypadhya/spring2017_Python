<html><head><h3>Royal Resort, Las Vegas Reviews Page 10</h3></head><body><br>It was just OK.<p>We just returned from spending three nights at the Royal Resort, and it was definitely a mixed bag. First, the positives: It's not expensive, the free parking is convenient, our room was comfortable, the staff were friendly, and they even replaced a broken shower head very promptly (on a Sunday, no less). The pool is excellent. And the onsite restaurant (The Barrymore) is terrific, definitely worth a visit.

And the not so positives: It's a tired property that is clearly past its prime. It just looks like nobody cares about making the space attractive or inviting. Too many things are shabby. There is a nice looking bar in the lobby, but it's not open and looks like it hasn't been for some time. The "Business Center" is an empty office where it looks like there were maybe once computers available - but now it's just an empty space. There is no free Wifi. And this is not the hotel's fault, but the neighborhood is pretty dreary.

On balance, there is no particular reason to stay here and we will stay somewhere else when we return to Vegas.</p><br>Lovely stay<p>Room was comfortable and clean, not the best of views but was not expecting it to be. Could easily walk to the strip. Staff wear friendly and welcoming. Stayed for six nights and only problem we had was when the wind blew one night and the patio door rattled. Would stay again.</p><br>Just average, wouldn't stay again<p>The reception area of the hotel is nice, the rooms are spacious and the beds are huge, it's handy to have a 7/11, a Denny's and other shops across the road. Other than the afore mentioned, this hotel is pretty average and I wouldn't stay again. The location isn't great as it's a long walk to the main strip were the big hotels and attractions are so we mostly got taxis. The decor is really dated and not what you expect from Las Vegas. Our room was overlooking the carpark and the 'balcony' can NOT be called a balcony. There was barely enough room for one person to stand with the door closed and as we were so high up it felt a little unsafe standing out there pushed against the railing. Our air con was broken, it was really noisy and wouldn't turn off which left us really cold in the night. Staff weren't very helpful with this, we contacted reception numerous times and when someone was sent to our room they didn't actually fix the problem. Our stay wasn't horrific, I suppose this place is ok if you're on a budget but we definitely wouldn't stay here again we would pay a little more for a better experience.</p><br>Comfortable stay for price, very clean<p>The location couldn't have been better: a ten minute walk from the convention center (great for attending NAB) and the street noise was minimum. The rate was as low as Motel 6 - I wasn't expecting much but the rooms and grounds were kept extremely clean! There was a fridge and coffee maker in the room, as well as a pool and hot tub (that stayed open till 10:00pm so a person working all day actually had an opportunity to enjoy them!) They also had a gym on the grounds but most of the equipment wasn't functioning properly. The aesthetics of my room weren't much to write about, but the sheets were clean, the bed comfortable, the shower had great pressure and I received an upper corner room as I had requested.

The staff, although friendly, wasn't overly accommodating. I was first told I could check in early but was turned away when I arrived. When I returned an hour after I was asked to, I still wasn't able to check in for there were computer problems. One would think being delayed would result in either a slight discount or a drink voucher at their restaurant but nothing was offered outside of an apology. The check out process was quick but not friendly at all.

Even with those mis-steps, I was very pleased with my stay. If visiting for work again and needing quick access to the convention center, i would absolutely return to the Royal Resort!
Room Tip: Request a back facing room to be off the street
See more room tips</p><br>Not So "Suite"<p>I Location: 1 block off Las Vegas Blvd turn right onto Convention Centre Drive. Between Encore & Riviera.
Resort: Older, typical pool, &Jacuzzi. Workout room well maintained with newer equipment
STAFF: Courteous & efficient
Rooms: No different than typical older Vegas hotel room. Our studio was equipped with mini-fridge, microwave, coffeemaker. Small 2 chair table, 1 chair, and queen-size bed. Small outside patio with 2 table & chairs. Overall furnishings somewhat dated but in good repair
Bed: Very comfortable with good quality sheets-but ours had a hole in it.

Would not spend more than $35 or $40 per night. Definitely do not exchange your week here. Not worth the money
Room Tip: Ask for a room overlooking the pool. Less noise. Also be aware that there's a good 3/4" gap...

Room was fairly large. Mostly quiet overall. Clean overall except hallways are a bit worn but not too bad. Now the problem. The Hallways and some areas of the hotel have a funny smell. Sort of like a skunk but nowhere that bad. Still it is prevalent. If they could do something about this I would recommend this hotel. But until they do I cannot.
Room Tip: Ask for a corner room.

"Vacation" - if you close your eyes
"Suites" - yup, if two rooms means it's a suite

This place is a really good deal if you need a place to sleep while in town for a convention. You can walk to the convention center which is really handy considering the traffic. If you think this is a vacation destination, you will be very disappointed.

The staff are really helpful - especially when they need to help move you to another room at midnight because the vibrations on the roof are so loud you can't sleep.
Room Tip: Do not take a room on the 8th floor - the AC gear above you is very noisy.
