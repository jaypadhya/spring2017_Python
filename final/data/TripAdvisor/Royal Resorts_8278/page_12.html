<html><head><h3>Royal Resort, Las Vegas Reviews Page 12</h3></head><body><br>Wacth out for internet fees!<p>This hotel is average at best - a decent price for the space compared to the glitzy casino hotels on the Strip. But it is a very tired, outdated hotel with limited services. It's only real selling point is proximity to the Las Vegas Convention Center. If you don't need to be there, then you can find better for a comparable price elsewhere. What I found astounding were the internet fees - $40 for 7 days, which isn't so bad until you realize that this is PER DEVICE! So if you are traveling with more than one person - say a family with children who use laptops and iPads, you will quickly eat up any savings in room costs with their internet fees. In this day and age, I found this incredible and a blatant rip off, especially since the hotel tries to market itself to families or those who need space for several people in one room or suite. I hope other travelers protest this so that perhaps there will be a policy change in the future. Very disappointing from a facility that should be doing more, not less, for it's customers, especially given the competition in a city like Las Vegas.

See more room tips</p><br>Comfortable, convenient<p>I was in Las Vegas for a training class, so I wasn't looking for a big name hotel. The Royal Vacation suites were just what I needed. I exchanged a time-share week, so the cost was minimal.The room was clean and comfortable.

The marquee outside shows the name "Royal Resorts". This is actually not a resort in that there are no activities or amenities that you wouldn't expect in a hotel of similar size. The hotel is conveniently located just off the north end of the Strip. Even though I did not visit any of the casinos, it was great fun to drive along the Strip. I don't think there's a place like it anywhere else.

I did not have to pay for wi-fi in the room because I was a time-share guest. Otherwise, I would have had to pay the going rate of about $8.00 a day. There is free wi-fi in the lobby, but that is not a secure connection.</p><br>Comfort and Fun<p>Great location to los Vegas bvd (approx. 0.5 mi). Room was spacious and clean. We booked through RCI so we had an adjoining room, which enabled us to sleep 6, 2 in the bed and 2 on each sofa. The staff was friendly and the hotel always smelled nice and fresh.

See more room tips</p><br>OK to stay but not that very good<p>I booked the hotel on some hotel site. The trick of this hotel is that the price looks rather good but there is cancellation fee. So basically you get stuck in before you know all the things.

OK. When we got there, the outside of the hotel looked really good, but the room for four of us looked small. Wifi is not free.

When we suggested to cancel the room with the folks there, they said that that was not their responsibility and I had to call to the head quarter somewhere else with confirmation number online. What kind of accountability was that?

Pros:

- Good location, very close to the center.
- Great customer service. If you need anything, call and they respond quickly.
OK a place generally.

Cons:
- No microwave in the room.
- Paid wifi.
- Small room.
- Not free cancellation</p><br>Clean, Convenient Las Vegas Hotel<p>Calling this place a ‘resort’ might be a little bit of a stretch, but this hotel is definitely a great place to stay. Our room was clean and comfortable.

One of our biggest concerns is being able to quickly get from our car to our room without going through the typical hotel casino maze. This place fit the bill. Parking was ample. Our walk to the Convention Center was easy. We rented a car, but walking the strip was also very easy from the hotel. The Walgreen’s nearby was also handy.

The staff was friendly and helpful with the questions we had and provided extra towels to our room quickly when we asked for them.

We did not take advantage of the pool or hot tub, but both looked very nice from a distance. We did not eat at the restaurant in the hotel.

I agree with another reviewer that the balcony is very small and that the view wasn't great. We found it funny and didn't really intend on sitting out on it anyhow. Not a big deal to us.

A small, fun group formed every night by the piano in the lobby. They seemed to be having a nice time.</p><br>The perfect budget hotel for Vegas Vetrans<p>We've stayed at several strip hotels over the last 7 years and we wanted to try a budget hotel for a change. The money saved is more than enough to compensate for any small disappointments you may have with the Royal Resort.

It's quiet, calm and doesn't have the big hotel attitude. Check in was a breeze, no queueing and efficient, as was the checkout process. They do take a $100 deposit on your card but it gets refunded on departure.

The rooms are more than adequate and the beds comfortable. Cleanliness was good, although we missed out on maid service a few days in a row because we slept very late (our fault not the hotel's). The bathroom is small but has everything you need and the water is hot, shower pressure is good. The small 'kitchen' area is OK for making tea and coffee in the supplied percolator and a small refrigerator is fine for milk and any snack items you want to store.

The building has a dated feel, probably a 60's or 70's construction and the rooms are a little tired with pretty bland décor but if all you do is sleep in it then it's no big deal.

If you are like us and use the hotel as a place to crash out, clean up and use as a base, the Royal is a good choice. We didn't try any of the other facilities like the pool or Barrymore restaurant but we were told by a couple of other residents that the Barrymore has a good reputation.

So the true test is would we go back? YES WE WOULD, and will next year.

See more room tips</p><br>Perfect slow paced hotel<p>This was our 4th trip to go to Las Vegas to go to SEMA show at the convention center and the 1st time to stay at this property. It is a small hotel in comparison to all the casino resorts which made checking in a breeze. There is no casino which was great for us as you were able to go straight to the elevator and to a nice clean room. The location was perfect for us - It is a short walk to either the strip or convention center.</p><br>Better than I expected!<p>As Las Vegas regulars, we were very nervous about staying here as we usually stay at Riviera and are generally happy there. Royal Resort was a good deal and didn't have the sting of the 'Resort fee' that many Vegas hotels charge (including Riviera) which are getting very high.

I am pleased to report that our stay was a pleasant one! The rooms are lovely, clean, have huge beds, lots of wardrobe and drawer space, an extra fold out bed, table, comfortable lounge chair, microwave, refrigerator and freezer, iron and flat screen TV. The view was also great, from our room we had a view of the pool, the Encore and a distant view of the Rio. The hotel even provided good quality toilet paper, tissues and Treseme shampoo and conditioner!!!

The area is fine, ignore other reviewers who say it isn't, it's a stones throw from the Vegas strip! Yes there are drug dealers who hang around outside Dennys/Walgreens (across the road), but other than that it's fine. By the logic that this is in a bad area, you could call the entire strip a bad area!

Yes you have to leave a $100 deposit, but if we'd stayed at a hotel with a resort fee we would've paid that and not got it back!

The only criticisms of our room were:

1 The heating didn't work. This sounds like a joke in Vegas but in November it gets chilly at night.
2 The safe was locked on arrival so couldn't get in it to use it.

There is a member of staff who can fix these things; when we told the staff at reception about the safe, they said to ask at 9am the following day for the maintenance guy, we then asked at 10:45 the next morning and he hadn't arrived yet! We never bothered telling them about the heating as we would never be in when the maintenance guy was so there didn't seem to be any point, plus, as we didn't have a safe we could use I didn't feel comfortable having people in the room while we were out!

Overall we had a lovely stay and would (and probably will) stay again.</p><br>Terrible place do not stay here!<p>Do not stay here, there are other hotels in Las Vegas for a similar price at a much higher standard. Staff were disinterested in providing quality customer service. We were charged 100 dollars on arrival as a deposit, we were not informed that there would be such a steep deposit requirement. The air con in the room was broken and was incredibly noisy keeping us up at night, and there were no instructions given on how to use it. When we contacted reception we were told someone would be with us in 10 minutes, we waited 40 minutes and when the man arrived he told us he was security and didn't know what to do so simply pulled it apart. When we contacted reception again we were told we could not switch the temperature from hot to cold without climbing into a vent. The fridge was warmer than the room, another item that was broken. The Barrymore restaurant in the hotel is ridiculously over priced, especially as it is part of a budget hotel. The television had extremely limited channels and when we did find a channel the signal made it almost impossible to watch. The balconies should NOT be labelled as balconies, there is barely enough room for one person to stand outside without feeling as though you will fall through the somewhat unsafe looking railing. We were told we had a strip view, we were given a parking lot view. The coffee making facilities were dirty, the bath was dirty and so was the shower head. The swimming pool was situated basically in the parking lot and was in the shade for most of the day. Housekeeping did not empty the bins in the room, nor did they change the linen on the beds. Housekeeping would enter the room at 8am and if you were not awake they would leave and the room would not be cleaned. The hotel is out of the way of the strip and the main attractions and restaurants. If you are planning a night out it will be a half an hour walk minimum or 20 dollars in a taxi. Overall, this was a really poor hotel in every aspect. Very disappointing and I would advise anyone not to stay here.</p><br>Don't stay here!!! Lots of better cheap hotels in Vegas!<p>I read reviews of this hotel and thought it would be a good cheap option to stay one night before heading back home, as we were in Las Vegas primarily to rock climb and run a race. The hotel looks run down from the outside and although not far from the strip it is in a kind of sketchy area. The hotel room did not have soap, shampoo, conditioner, lotion or even tissues. How can a hotel not even provide hand soap??? Also, the air conditioner did not work and our room was unbearably hot! We turned it down to 64 degrees and the coolest it got was 75 in our room. It blew hot air all night long. So uncomfortable!!! The carpet in our room was stained in multiple places with large dark spots and the curtains in the room smelled VERY strongly of cigarette smoke even though it was a non-smoking room. I would never recommend this hotel to anyone! Don't stay here. Spend your money elsewhere!</p><br></body></html>
