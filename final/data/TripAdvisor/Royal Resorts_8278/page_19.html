The room has always been very clean and tidy & it's nice to have a quiet pool area!! Overall, great hotel and would always stay here whilst in Vegas!</p><br>Horrific Customer Service<p>Beware of this resort. I recently had a reservation to stay here for three nights but they overbooked the hotel. Okay, these things can happen, but the way that the mistake was handled was completely unacceptable:
Upon arriving at the hotel I was told by the front desk staff that I was being moved to another hotel but the woman refused to tell me what hotel, explain how I would get there, or give me any additional details. A second staff member eventually came to explain the over-booking situation and told me that I would be moved to an alternate hotel down the street. When I was asked who would be transporting me to the other hotel I was told I could walk. When I stated that this was unacceptable I was told that a cab would be called but that I would have to pay the fee. Only after multiple minutes of argument did they eventually agree to pay for my transportation to the other hotel. Nobody apologized for the inconvenience.
Over the next few days I continued to be forced into arguments with various staff members as all involved claimed no responsibility for the mix up, moved me to lesser accommodations, refused to provide assistance, were exceptionally rude, and did nothing to compensate me for the inconvenience or unacceptable alternative accommodations.
I am still in utter disbelief at the level of horrible customer service and would never recommend this hotel to anyone.

Once back at the correct hotel, for the last night, I was neither impressed nor put off by the hotel rooms. Though I was only there for the one day instead of the three, I do think it's quite the stretch to call this a resort. It's a basic hotel.</p><br>Very good for the price<p>My husband and I stayed there for one night. Good hotel for the price. Near the Las Vegas strip but not the spectacular part of the strip. Older area but not threatening. We were glad to have Denny's, Walgreens, and several local eateries about 1 block away.</p><br>Nice Location<p>Was there for New Years.

Location was great - rooms were substandard - no wifi - the bar, pool and hottub were first rate - the entertainment was very good. Drink prices were superb based on the fact you were 150' from the strip.

The rooms need a serious facelift and carpeting everywhere was horrible.

All in all a decent place to stay - but it isn't ANYTHING like staying at one of the casino's - if it weren't for the fact that this was a timeshare exchange I would not have even known this place existed. Was across the street from CVS which was nice.
Room Tip: We chose the room overlooking the pool which gives you a sliding glass door to overlook the pool par...

Even though we did not have a full kitchen - the microwave, small refrigerator, toaster,and coffee maker were enough to allow us to make many simple meals there. The friendly staff were very helpful and efficient. Be sure to ask for a quiet room since they often have music downstairs that can be heard in some roooms. We plan to visit there again soon.</p><br>Upscale coming!!<p>I recently visited the royal resort and the only thing I saw royal as the renovation in the lobby. It looked very nice! When you get upstairs to the suites (timeshare) they are a let down. The only thing I saw upgraded was the bed and flatscreens. The living room has no light (only one small lamp) and the pullout sofas (2) need to be replaced (ASAP). The two bathrooms are great but the carpet (hallway included) needs replacing as well. Its on its way and I hope it continues to improve because it's right around the corner from the strip (location is the best)!</p><br>Noisy!!!<p>Also known as The Royal Resort Hotel............Avoid this place its so noisy and overpriced, nobody seems interested in pleasing the Hotel Guests, Rock n Roll concerts, Rap gigs, Karaoke in the Bar. Staff on reception do not aim to please....no customer service skills at all?
Too many problems to list...........Such a shame, to be let down by the noise in there, after a refit and lovely new a la carte restaurant...........
Room Tip: If you must stay there......take your ears plugs!!!
See more room tips</p><br>Upscale has begun!<p>Wow! What a difference a year makes! The Royal Resort was a functional, well placed, passable resort. The look now is sensational. The lobby has been completely remodeled to as upscale as you'd like. They have added a sensational restaurant, "The Barrymore". The lounge is old style elegant, with a friendly staff and great prices. They have entertainment on a small 2nd floor showroom or the now elegant lobby lounge. For free!! Excellent, likable bands, soloist or comedy troupes.

Apparently the "hotel/timeshare" is seperate from the renovation. The suites and 1 bedroom units are still functional, but not of the ilk of the lobby. Change may come, and I hope it does, but an elevator ride gets you a good show, a nice bar and a great restaurant. Located a 100 yds from the strip, this is going to be a gem -- functioning now as a diamond in the rough!</p><br>It has gone down hill and we hope to never go back<p>My wife and I have been staying at this hotel for 10 years and never had any problems until this year. They have changed management and most of their old workers have left. The front desk people are extremely disinterested and rude. Not one time during our stay did maid service come to our room. We went to the desk several times asking for fresh coffee cups and clean towels. Telling them each time that nobody from housekeeping had been to our room yet, not even to change out our linen. We would have to go back to our room and wait at least a half an hour for someone to bring up towels and coffee cups.
We also lost a days use of the pool because there was a band playing at the pool. Electrical equipment and water don't mix well. One night there was a private party for Yelp. They had 2 catering vans outside our window and it was extremely loud. Non-guest were outside shouting and wondering all over the parking lot. There was no security guard making sure cars were safe. We will not stay at the Royal Resort in Las Vegas again nor would we advise anyone else to stay there. There is nothing close by anymore. The Stardust is gone and not going to be rebuilt. The Sahara is closed. That entire part of town has become so run down and seedy.</p><br>worst hotel i've ever stayed in<p>This is perhaps the worst hotel that I've stayed in Las Vegas to date. We stayed in the the second floor, and you can hear the loud music coming from the main floor at midnight. the hotel restaurant was under renovation, and yet management does not have a list of recommended restaurant in the area. Being first time, I had to drive around to look for a place to eat on check in date. Unit appeared as if it has been vacuumed for days, you can practically see the dust on the corners. The worst that happened was that our room had never been serviced the two nights we stayed. When we confronted the manager upon check-out, she said that service should have been requested, which was contrary to the printed procedure in the unit. For a studio @ $75/night, this place is very expensive.</p><br></body></html>
