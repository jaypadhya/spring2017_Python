<html><head><h3>Royal Resort, Las Vegas Reviews Page 8</h3></head><body><br>Quiet, clean, friendly, convenient to Convention Center<p>I had a good 2 night-stay while attending a trade show at the Las Vegas Convention Center, 10 min walk away. It is an older hotel, but it has character and is well-enough maintained.

Pros: Quiet. No casino, no smell of smoking; clean and simple rooms; bed OK; convenient walk to Convention center (10 min) and Wynn Hotel (5 min) and Denny's/Walgreen (3 min). Great value. Barrymore's restaurant is a jewel (Yelp 4.5 stars) with excellent food and ambiance and live entertainment too. Ate there 2x.

Cons: Pillows a little lumpy. Only 1 person at front desk so could be a bit slow if you're in a hurry and there is a line. Not really an issue for me. No free Wifi.

Overall, I would have no problem staying here again on a business trip. Enjoyed it.</p><br>Had just what we needed and no resort fee<p>We went to Vegas for a concert and decided to stay here. We did so just for the price. Got a very good deal for a Friday/Saturday night compared to everywhere in Las Vegas. The staff was nice and check-in was no issue. The room was fine. It was clean and provided a nice base camp for our activities. The TV was old school and had very few local channels, but we weren't in town to watch television. Each room has a small balcony and it was pretty nice to just go outside and look around each morning. There was a downside to the balcony. The sliding glass door didn't do much to keep street noise out and there appeared to be a very active firestation just down the road, so there were a decent amount of sirens through the night. Not a huge deal, but caution for you light sleepers. One other thing, the hallway smelled kinda weird. Like baby powder or something. The room didn't smell at all but the hallway was a little funky smelling. I would stay here again if the price was right.</p><br>Shocked at the customer service by the front desk staff<p>I have stayed in this hotel before. We had a wonderful time. A very pleasant experience that we ended up extending our stay for another night. However, when trying to book another hotel room on their website, the website said it was working and never moved from the final page. Apparently online is the only way you can book a hotel room at this resort. I called to query why the website wouldn't work and the lady that answered the phone was rude, blunt and very unhelpful. The phone rang for a long time before it was finally answered by a woman who at first I thought was laughing which I considered very strange and unprofessional. I thought I had the wrong number for a while. I explained my situation which was then followed by a long pause followed by a comment about the possibility of the hotel being full. I felt like I was interrupting the womans day by calling her in the middle of possibly a very entertaining story. She didnt offer to check for me if the hotel was indeed full, just kept quiet on the other end of the line. When slightly prompted, she decided to finally check if that was the case. It wasn't full for the night I was requesting and no alternative reason for my problem could be provided. The more shocking occurance was the fact that she offered no further help in this regard. Eventually I made sure that there was nothing she could do about it and the response I received from here was shocking to say the least. No. There is nothing that she can do (despite the fact that she is at the front desk, accepting calls from potential customers, essentially the face of the hotel.) I could not believe the terrible service from this woman. Her total lack of disregard towards a potential customer was shocking to say the least.</p><br>One night stay in Vegas<p>We were on our way to California and stayed a night in Vegas before going the rest of the way. Then stayed on our way back home a week later. Royal Vacation Suites Hotel is not a casino which actually made it nice for us with our family. It is an older hotel but in good shape. The rooms were decent. The first room we stayed in had a king and a murphy bed. Our girls shared the Murphy bed and said it was comfortable. Good rating for teenage girls. The room was a little tight. On the way back we stayed in an Executive Suite which had a seperate bedroom and another room with two sleeper sofas. It gave us a lot more room and privacy plus 2 bathrooms which was nice with two teenage girls. The sleeper sofas were not as comfortable for the girls but liked having more space. The pool is nice. The hotel is right next to Las Vegas Blvd so close to the casinos and able to walk down and see the sights. Free parking was a plus. The price was decent. I would recommend it to anyone who doesn't want to deal with lots of noise and ok with not being in a casino.
Room Tip: Check directly with hotel website. May have better rates then other hotel sites. Pick the executiv...

The rooms are dated but that wasn't a bother. It was clean! It was a 10 minute walk to the convention center which was very convenient. Walgreens 24 hours, Denny's, Ross's and a few other restaurants were walking distance as well. Now you are very south of the strip. I went to the fashion show mall which is about a 10 minute walk so not so bad. From the strip you are right behind Wynn and Encore. Overall if I am working at the convention center again I will definitely look into staying here again. Especially if the rate was what I paid. Oh & WIFI is not free...$10 per day.
Room Tip: Go for the upgraded room.

Some of my family live in Albuquerque and are big UNM Lobo fans so we go to the mountain west tournament every year. I decided to give them one last look in March because I had a free week stay with interval international. Well it turns out I made the right decision 10 years ago. The resort is the same as it was 10 years ago. No to bad but not up to the Vegas strip standards. The tower that was suppose to be built 10 years ago has not happened. With so many places to stay in Las Vegas, I will not return to this location again.</p><br>Good value, good location<p>Spent a few nights here because I was attending a convention at the Las Vegas Convention Center. The hotel is near to a lot of restaurants and a 24 hr Walgreens pharmacy. It's also a 5-10 minute walk from the convention center. Our room was nice and beds were cozy. The staff was friendly and helpful when we asked for suggestions about good eateries and our check in and check out was very smooth.

The cons: our toilet did not flushing properly on the first flush and the mini-fridge was not working. Paid wifi; we decided to not to purchase as it was unnecessary for us but they should consider "free internet" or adding it to the room rates as it is becoming much more the norm now.</p><br>Remember<p>First casino I ever went to back in the day. I was disappointed there was no casino there anymore but as a hotel it was just fine. It's on the North side up near Circus Circus and there's a KILLER taco place AND an AYCE sushi place right around the corner that you HAVE to hit. The taco place after a night of walking the strip and the sushi place for lunch.</p><br>Very good value for money<p>We stayed at this hotel over the weekend when we were in Vegas as most hotels hike their prices on Friday and Saturday nights. Royal Vacation Suites cost next to nothing over the weekend priced at around 35 Dollars so it was our main incentive for staying there.
We weren't expecting much too be honest - budget hotel standard, nthing more. However we were really pleasantly surprised by the overall quality and service we experienced there.
The room was spick and span and spacious, there were French windows leading onto a small balcony, coffee making facilities and a fridge (note that coffee makers and fridges are hard to find in most Vegas hotels). We had a view of Riviera and Circus Circus from our room which was nice. The bathroom was functional but very clean, pleasantly decorated and had a hairdryer which was important for me.
The pool was quite simple but clean and warm and the hot tub was hot. There are cabanas available for free, and sun loungers with comfy mattresses too. Compared to the pool at Planet Hollywood (see my review of that hotel), the pool at the Royal Resort is miles better.
The front desk staff were friendly bar one lady who was rather curt.
The only slightly negative point I found was that the 'Barrymore' bar which is proudly advertised on the sign outside was never open while we were there and this makes for rather a sad ambience in the lobby which is a shame because the lobby is quite fancily decorated - they could make better use of the space.
Concerning the location of the hotel, it is close to Ross, Circus, Circus and Riviera and a 5 minute walk from Encore. It's not the best part of the strip but it's within easy walking distance of the more coveted part of the strip.
The bottom line: excellent value for money especially over the weekend.
Room Tip: Choose a non-smoking room if you don't smoke.
See more room tips</p><br>Average at best!<p>Just came back from a week stay at this hotel. The lobby is like walking into the 70's. Check in was quick and easy. Parking was plentiful and convenient. The room was a bit tired, but clean and spacious. The bed was comfortable. The fridge and coffeemaker, iron, and ironing board were nice touches. Now for the bad. The hall carpeting was disgusting. It was dirty and coming of the floor. The bathroom was small and the door opens into the bathroom, so you can't go into the shower with the door opened. The pool is opened all night long, so I could here kid's screaming at 1 in the morning. The room was only cleaned once during my stay. Its a good walk to the strip. All in all, I think you get what you pay for. I think if you look however, you can stay at a better place for the same price.</p><br></body></html>
