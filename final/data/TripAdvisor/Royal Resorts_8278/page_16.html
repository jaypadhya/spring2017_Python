<html><head><h3>Royal Resort, Las Vegas Reviews Page 16</h3></head><body><br>Royal House<p>We planed a quick weekend getway to Vegas and stayed at this hotel. Great value for the money we paid. We only needed a place to sleep (and used it as such), so it meet our expectations. We didnâ€™t have any issues and would stay here again. The only down side is that it is far away from everything else. However, every time we go to Las Vegas we buy daily/weekend passes for The Deuce, so getting to places on the strip has never been an issue. I strongly recommend using The Deuce bus if you are staying at this hotel.</p><br>Stay somewhere else<p>The hotel is off the strip, at the end near the Wynn. The strip is walking distance but it's a hike so don't think about it unless you're in shape. I am - and it took me 35 minutes to walk to the hotel from Bellagio. It is a little deserted around the hotel and probably not the best area to be outside alone at night. One of my friends was accosted last night outside the lobby doors.

As far as the hotel itself, I'm sitting in the room with the tv on. There is loud pounding music at the pool - it took 4 calls to the front desk to find out it will continue until midnight. The manager finally offered to move me, but I'm with friends and they are out for the evening so moving now (950 PM) isn't viable. Beyond that, the carpet is grungy. The beds are comfortable. It took two calls to the front desk to get more towels (the room had 3; we are a group of 4). There is a one-cup (not keurig-like, so don't bother bringing k-cups) coffeemaker in the room, but they only gave us a single coffee packet.</p><br>Royal Resort - Las Vegas<p>I booked and stayed at this property from September 29th through October 4th, 2012. This is a low cost, reasonably well appointed and centrally located hotel. I can see that they are trying to fit into the "Botique" hotel category. The entrance, lobby, bar, restaurant, and swimming pool-hot tub-cabana area have all been significantly (and recently) upgraded. They are painting the exterior (started on the October 1st). Parking is not a problem, even on weekends when the place is super busy.

The (1 king) room was large enough and well furnished. Both bed and pillows were firm, which I appreciated. The in-room TV small, but it worked. The coffee maker and coffee were welcomed. I suspect that the furniture and carpeting will be replaced in the near future, they are both showing their age.

This is NOT a Las Vegas Strip mega resort-casino, it is a step up from chain hotels, and quite appropriate for the price paid. The staff whenever - wherever encountered were friendly and helpful.

WIFI (although not free) is available, consistent, secure, and reliable.

While Royal Resort is centrally located, equidistant from the STRIP and Downtown it is not walking distance from either, you will drive and park to any "attraction". There is a Denny's and a Peppermill restaurant just across the street, and Korean and Indian buffet restaurants next door. You needn't go hungry just because there's no breakfast/lunch at the hotel.</p><br>not the best place to stay<p>We stayed there for two nights last week. We were checked in to the room near the lift. Nobody informed us that in the evening its gonna be two parties-one until midnight and another until 3am. We couldn't sleep because drunk people was shouting, screaming, running, smoking... The worst part they were riding an elevator up and down and barking. Now sounds funny, but when you want to rest, its not. We went to reception and changed the room. Our second room was in another floor, we could sleep at least a few hours. Next morning I wanted to make a cup of coffee, but the coffee maker was broken. I went to reception and asked for another one. Was waiting for about an hour but nobody brought me one. So I went to reception again. Then I got it very quickly. After a few minutes i found out that the fridge is not working as well. I asked to have a look and they replaced it very quickly.


They have beautiful swimming pool and the location of the hotel is very good. there is no free Wifi, no breakfast. Have we enjoyed our stay here? No</p><br>Such a nice place!<p>My husband and I planned a budgeted trip to vegas (it was my first time) and I was kinda scared after reading the reviews, but for 25 bucks a night, I thought we'd give it a try. Check-In was a little slow due to computer problems but once it was fixed, it was quick. They were also very friendly. I requested a room on a high level and when we walked in we were amazed at how clean and roomy it was and the view was fantastic! It was also quiet at night. The pool looked nice and big but we didnt go in. Check out was quick and there were no hidden fees. 25 bucks a night for 2 nights was defenatly a great find. We would stay again.
Room Tip: request a high level

Lots of free parking behind hotel, few steps through rear door to front desk where Roy very helpfully had us in a 4th floor room, away from really loud band on west ground side. Room was basic but adequate will very comfy king, microwave, fridge, coffeemaker, extra murphy bed, etc. Everything worked specially the a/c. Location is a matter of choice, so as we didn't need to be on the Strip, driving from the Royal was ideal for trips to Hoover Dam, Mount Charleston, Fremont, Stratosphere, Fashion Show Mall, Wynn and all other attractions south on the Blvd. Hotel had a nice sized pool but lonely as we were the only swimmers, no bar service. If extra trimmings are needed, pick another hotel, otherwise, the Royal is fine.
Room Tip: East side, at least 4 floors up, away from band music, otherwise very quiet.

No bells and whistles, but that shouldn't be an issue if you will be sightseeing. The king room was adequate and clean, the flat screen was nice, and the bedding was excellent! The hotel staff was ok. They told us that there was no WiFi, however, there is for free, but they have to give you a code. You're close to a Dennys, walgreens, 711, and a Chinese restaurant in a strip mall. The express bus stop is across the street from the hotel, and the strip bus stop is at the corner from Convention Ctr Dr. and Las Vegas Blvd. ($7 for 24 hrs). I would stay there again!</p><br>No Las Vegas "Resort Fees"<p>This is not a fancy place, but is in a quiet location just off the strip and is comfortable and clean. Every room has a small balcony. The pool and hot tub are very nice and private within a locked gated area. The area around the hotel has homeless people, but so does every pedestrian walkway near the strip area. There is a "mini" refrigerator, and single cup coffee maker. We found all staff to be very helpful and pleasant. Most Las Vegas hotels will give you an low nightly rate, then surprise you with a "resort fee" of $5 to $25 per night at check in. The Royal Resort does not play that game. I would compare this hotel to a Super 8, Econo Lodge or Howard Johnson.
Room Tip: We liked looking at the lights of the strip from our small balcony at the front of the hotel. The r...

I loved that it was away from the strip. I loved that there was a Walgreens and a Dennys right across the street. And the bus was very easy to catch. The staff were friendly enough. Except for Rosario, the lady that checked us out. She was mean and didnt know what she was doing. That is why I didnt give a 5 star review. Would I stay there again?!! You bet!</p><br></body></html>
