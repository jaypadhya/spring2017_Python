<html><head><h3>Royal Resort, Las Vegas Reviews Page 15</h3></head><body><br>Coming Back<p>My fiance and I were there to look at wedding venues. We like the hotel so much we would like to book a group of the rooms for our wedding and am trying to arrange that now. The 1 thing we look for it climbing is and amenities. Your hotel offered both. Our wedding is scheduled for March of 2013. We will be making at least 4 more trips that way and plan on staying there. The staff though young are very professional and that really helps. We look forward to staying there again real soon thank you</p><br>Super Location to Convention Center<p>This was our second time at this hotel (stayed there 2 years ago and our experience then was also positive). Our unit was dated but clean with everything we needed for our one night there. We arrived at 11am only hoping to get our parking permit and were delighted to find we could check in and put our luggage in the room. We had none of the issues other reviewers had. We did see that the restaurant was very pricey so ate at the Peppermill, only a short walk away (will review it separately). The desk attendants were very friendly. We saw the bar and the limited slots, but didn't take advantage of either. This is a great alternative if you are attending a convention and we would definitly stay there again. To get 10% off (covers the tax), mention AAA or AARP. To get that discount, call the 800 number given for the Trading Places office -- you don't get that booking on line.

Upon arrival, we were informed that for the first night we would have 3 rooms and the following nights only 2 rooms due to their system "GLITCH". For the following nights, they offered to put the one room in some weird hotel DownTown.

As far as we were concerned, that was not appropriate and we were very unhappy about it. We were there for work and imagine to have the group separated. Not only that, CES was only a 10 minutes walk down from the hotel. If we have had taken up their offer, our other colleagues will be put up at least 30 minutes away from us. Such inconvenience they caused us. Instead of a one person occupancy, the room had to accomodate 2 people. Worst stil, our group was a mixture of both male and female. Terribly inconvenient.

The lobby receptionist was terribly rude and kept insisting it was AGODA's fault but we've had booked many times with AGODA and they did a very wonderful job in all our previous bookings. We came co a conclusion that because it was CES, they accepted walked-ins as the rate has gone up triple comparison to a normal date. Imagine the frustration we had to go thru.

On top of that, the moment we got our rooms, two of our rooms water heater was not working. It was winter for god's sake! Another one of our room, the heater itself was not functioning! They dare call themselves a hotel or a resort? They were worst than a motel!

They changed our rooms and again the heater was not working. The service guy had to come up several times to sort it out.

We will never again stay in this particular hotel. For the price we were paying, it was totally not worth it.</p><br>A fixer upper of the motel variety<p>I got what I paid for! The ridiculously expensive rates during the New Year forced me to look for a motel off the strip. I paid on average $350/ room for cold, cramped, dingy rooms with awfully noisy heaters. I'm absolutely sure there weren't any insolation around the patio door because the bed beside the door was freezing cold. Upon closer examination, I saw a sofa with torn upholstery, loose faucet, and musty smelling comforters. To make matters worse they charge a $100 deposit " for security authorization" in case we damaged/ steal something. I got my deposit $ back but the rooms were already in poor condition and had damaged furnishing already...</p><br>Noisy Stay<p>I stayed at this hotel about two years ago with no problems. Since the last stay the hotel now has live music. The music from the bar area is so loud it can be heard throughout the hotel. My room was vibratuing at 12:30 AM. Front desk person was nice but could not do anything. Cora the manager said sorry but the bar area is a rented space and we have no control. The offered to move my room but it was only a few doors down. It would not have made any difference. It is so obnoxious for the hotel to have live music late night and disturb the entire hotel. There were only about 5 people in the bar watching the band.... If you stay at this hotel beware of this issue. Room was clean but looked dated and tired.
Room Tip: Far from the bar area on live music night
See more room tips</p><br>Good location for trade shows, reasonably priced<p>This place is good enough, well situated between LVCC and the strip. Small refrigerator in the room. Clean. Wifi access is $10 per day per device, so if there are two of you and you each have a computer and iPad, that's $40 per day. Nice little bar, just a handful of slots. No munchies, just a very expensive restaurant next door.

Bring your own pillows. They give you two anemic little things for a king sized bed.</p><br>Good place to stay on a budget<p>We stayed here for a week using and RCI coupon. 1 minute to the main strip street and a bus stop for the double decker either way right on the corner. Located just behind the Wynn/Encore at the north end of the new strip. The room was very comfortable. A super 8 type standard room with a comfortable bed, fridge, microwave, coffeemaker, table and chair. We were very happy with the room. Our idea was to spend little time in the room and more time running around the strip. Total success. The location is great! The staff were very friendly and helpful in giving suggestions on where to eat and things to do. The pool was nice and the hot tub was also great. If you don't want super fancy and just simple hotel with good rates then this place rocks. Hope you like it too.</p><br>Great location to the Vegas strip! Decent accommodations for price paid<p>I booked this hotel thru Orbitz. When I first called to confirm room wih two queens they found me but could not enter the request until 2 days before checkin. When I called back to confirm this 10/17, they couldn't find me in their system so I had to call Orbitz, and then they firmed it. Phew! I had pre-paid $194 for two nights (Fri and Sat.), I better have a reservation. The hotel location was great to the strip!! You can walk but with heels...no thx....a 5min taxi for $10 please! :-) There is no valet but the parking lot was right next to it. We stayed on the 8th floor in a two queens room, great view of Riveria. I didn't really experience lots of noise but after partying in Vegas and I being a heavy sleep, it satisfied me just fine. The room was decently nice and comfortable for the price paid. We even had a small balcony too!! There was a pool, but we didn't have time to use it. I would def stay here again due price and location.
Room Tip: It's a $10 cab fare (inc. tip) from the hotel to The Venetian. No nightly resort fee.

The pool area was clean and pleasent. The only negative was the band that played in the club on Friday, had one VERY loud number at midnight. Fortunately we were not asleep yet so we did not get blasted out of bed. The location of the hotel is wonderful. Having a coffee maker, fridge and micro was great! The street noise is almost non existant. The lobby is smoke free which we really appreciated after the casino's. The check in/check out was very fast and the desk staff was very courteous and helpful.
The lobby is old and needs updating. What items they have around are from times long gone. Look past that, it is worth it. (There is a lot of potential there if someone were to invest a little money.)
We would definately stay there again. We did not miss a thing by not staying at a casino. (Except noise, smoke, crowds and slow elevators). Their elevators are really fast. I highly recommend this hotel. In my opinion the only reason it is not a 3+ hotel is the lobby decor.</p><br>Clogged Bathtub<p>We stayed in this hotel for 4 nights last September. My husband was attending an exhibition and the last minute booking was arranged by his company as the other hotel was already fully booked. If you are driving, parking is not a problem. Asked from the reception a tag to be displayed in your car to avoid being wheel clamped.
Our room with a balcony was in the 7th floor overlooking the main road and noise was not a problem. Although the room was clean, the carpet was old and grungy The beds and pillows were comfortable. The shower was good but the tub gets flooded really fast. I went to the reception twice to request that the clogged bathtub be fixed. After 4 days, nothing was done. For US$90+ a night without free wifi, it's not worth it. Walgreens and Ross store were across the street and kept me and my daughter occupied during the day.</p><br></body></html>
