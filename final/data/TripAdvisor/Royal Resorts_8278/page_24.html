<html><head><h3>Royal Resort, Las Vegas Reviews Page 24</h3></head><body><br>Good location but bring a torch<p>If you're visitng the Las Vegas Convention Center, this is in a good location - it's 5 minutes to walk to the venue while in the other direction you're only seconds from the strip with some reasonable casinos and shops around.

This hotel's location is a good compromise for LVCC visitors, and you can walk to just about anything, or get the monorail.

The lobby was nice and marbled, check-in was fast as were the elevators which eerily always seemed to be ready and waiting no matter what floor you're on.

When you get out of the elevator, though, things take a turn for the worse. The carpet looks worn and shabby with industrial lighting in the corridors.

The room was OK as far as furnishings go, but it was oh so dark. They're using energy saving lamps throughout which is fine, but they seem to be about 5W in power so at night or early in the morning before the sun's up it's just so gloomy. In the bathroom there's one lamp by the basin, making the shower in almost darkness at any time of day.

The room has a small balcony about the depth of a pack of poker cards, but it was nice to open the doors and watch the construction workers hard at it on the new hotel they're building at the back.

Parking is plentiful and I believe there's a pool at the rear, but the weather wasn't up to the job during this trip.

It seemed a number of airline staff stay at this hotel, so it's probably quite good value. Either that, or they like the fact that the lights are already dimmed for take-off.

Vegas seems to have become expensive for hotels in general, so the Royal Resort is a fair price for the convenience but unless you're visiting the Convention Center, there are probably better deals to be had just off the strip.</p><br>Better Than Downtown If You're On a Budget<p>Royal Resort is similar to a Holiday Inn Express or Best Western or other generic hotel you'd find in your own hometown. It doesn't have a theme, or a casino, or any of the glitz and glamour that tourists want to see when they visit Vegas. But if you've been to Vegas as many times as I have, and all you care about is whether the hotel is safe, clean, and affordable, then this may be a good option.

The hotel promises a bit more than it delivers. It's not a "Resort," just a hotel. It's not located "in the heart of the famous Las Vegas strip, next to Wynn," but is a block or two off the strip and it took us about fifteen minutes to walk to the Wynn. The "studio suite" we rented was a regular hotel room with one king bed and one queen Murphy bed. Have you ever heard of a hotel room with a Murphy bed?! That was a shocker but was actually quite comfortable. When we checked in, the desk clerk said, “Your room has a balcony!” as if we should be excited, but we realized later that every room has one.

Pluses: Room rate was only $99 during the week and $149 on Fri/Sat, this during March Madness when other hotels were crazy expensive. Room was very clean with coffeemaker, microwave, and refrigerator. Modern decor including flat screen tv (although our friend's room was furnished differently from ours). No wait to check in, no long walk to get to our room, no getting lost in a giant parking garage, and no having to walk through a smoke-filled casino to get to the hotel. 24-hour Walgreens right across the street. Very quiet, no noise from the hallways or other guests. The guests we encountered in the lobby or hallways were either airline employees or well-behaved adults. No partying or little kids running around.

Minuses: Seemed like most cab drivers had never heard of Royal Resort and we had to tell them how to get there. There aren't any cabs waiting outside like you'd find at the big casinos, just a courtesy phone in the lobby that you can use to call yourself a ride. Then it takes forever for one to show up, probably because they can't find the hotel! Room felt a little warm at times and thermostat was locked so that we couldn’t set it any lower. Balcony so small that you couldn’t fit a chair out there – standing room only. The closest strip casinos are Riviera, Circus Circus, New Frontier, and Wynn. Yuck, Yuck, Yuck, and too expensive. I wouldn't recommend this location for a first-time visitor to Vegas, too far from center strip and a little bit seedy.

Finally, based on other reviews I should add that we didn’t notice a bad smell anyplace in the hotel and nobody bothered us about buying a timeshare. I will add photos to this review as soon as I can.</p><br>Good location, good price<p>We just returned from the Royal resort and had a great time. From views to staff to location, everything was great. I do agree with a previous reviewer that there was a horrible smell in the halls mid afternoon, but whatever it was did not reach the rooms... Staff was very helpful and friendly..

Cosmos has great food and prices, but the jazz music in the morning is way too loud, and staff are not permitted to turn down.</p><br>Just Okay<p>Very nice lobby in the hotel. Close to strip..definitely can walk..only like a block. One problem upon check-in was that we paid through Travelocity and they made an error and were going to bill us again directly (it was pre-paid)..so that would not have been correct. Although they corrected the error, they were very apologetic or very friendly at the desk for causing the inconvenience. The decor is dated, but all in all for the price the hotel if fine. We stayed in the Ambassador Suite. It was nice because it gave us two bathrooms and a separate living and bed room. It was pretty well kept clean. We stayed here two nights and then the Excalibur one day (due to weekend rates the Royal Resort was cheaper for Friday and Saturday). There is no comparison though to that end of the strip and the Excalibur end of the strip. Do yourself a favor and pay the extra few,several bucks a night. The Excalibur is close in price and waaaay better and nicer to stay at. There was nothing wrong with the Royal Resort, though I felt the price was a bit high for the accomodations and room decor. One other thing - the fitness room that is advertised would be nice with the exception of only having two treadmills that are both broken.</p><br>Great Place &amp; Location<p>We stayed at the Royal Resort for New Years Eve and had fabulous views of the Fireworks at Circus Circus and Stratosphere. The staff were polite and friendly. Cosmo's had great breakfasts and lunch, courtious staff. The room we had was large, clean and the housekeeping service was good. Bed was comfortable and lots of room. The place is located right of th strip near the Riveria but within walking distance to just about everything and across the street from a 24 hour Walgreens and next to a Nail and Salon Day Spa which gives the best pedicures ever. We enjoyed our stay and will return next year for another great stay.</p><br>Excellent choice<p>The Royal Resort is an excellent hotel in Las Vegas. I particularily enjoyed the lack of a casino which means you enter the doors and the front desk is a few feet away! The lobby is non-smoking - another huge plus in my view. Our room had a very comfortable king size bed and a queen size murphy bed. There was a small balcony. We made use of our fridge, microwave and coffee maker. Just across the street is a Walgrens, next door is a liquor store, the Strip is half a block and a block away is the Riveria. Everything you need is close by. The hotel staff was so friendly. Airline staff stay at this hotel so you know it is going to be great. I would highly recommend this hotel.

The bonus of this hotel is the superb restaurant - Cosmo's - which is off the lobby. I loved their breakfast as well as their wonderful dinners. Although Denny's is just around the corner you can purchase a breakfast special at Cosmos for the same money. Bravo!'

I will certainly stay here again.</p><br>Smelly<p>Every time I walked on the fifth floor of the building I smelled this odor that smelled like it was coming from a sewer. I am glad I was either out of the building most of the time or tipsy to not become to sick over the smell. The pool had cabanas and mist sprayers that were nice, but my friends had a bad experience at the pool. A man near the pool was touching himself and it made us very alarmed. Glad the radio worked since we left ours at home. Liked the location since it is close to Ross, Wallgreens, and Denny's (which is great for those long nights when you need some food after a lot of drinking).</p><br>Good Experience<p>We stayed at the Royal Resort 3/17/06 to 3/24/06. I have read reviews about an odor coming from somewhere, but everything smelled fine to us! The room was spacious and very clean. The staff was more than helpful and made us feel like family. Cosmo's Restaurant serves a delicious breakfast which we had every morning, but were gone all day so didn't eat other meals there. The location is good. Construction hasn't started yet on the new buildings, but I heard all the investors have sent back the papers so it should start soon. The Stardust across the street is going to have a $5 Billion renovation next year, so that will only increase the value of the property. We'll be back in the Fall.</p><br>The Royal Time Share Rip Off<p>The Royal is a good hotel for the price...but watch out for the time share people. They are great at offering the world, but losy at coming through. They are not ethical. I would not trust anything they say. Yes, we did the time share thing and yes we were offered a "steal". The only steal would be if you sign on the line for the "RESORT" that ha s been promised to be built for the last 2 years. I really do not think it will ever be built. Incidentally, the hotel was empty even on the weekends except for the "time share hawks".</p><br>Very accomodating - would go back<p>I was in Vegas for a wedding over the weekend and all of the guests booked rooms at the Royal Resort. We received a great value on our rooms. Booked a $169 room for $49 a night (it was $49 on Fri & Sat nights also). I do not feel that the hotel misled us in any way (as some of the other reviews suggested). The Royal Resort is very nicely decorated/furnished. The hotel interior is updated and classy and the entire property was spotless. The king suite was spacious, comfortable, elegantly decorated and everything in the room was new. The pool is larger than average and the staff allowed us to stay in the pool area "after hours" to finish watching the baseball game on the TV in the cabana. I worked in the hotel industry for seven years at a four-star hotel and I would rate this property very high in cleanliness, interior decor and friendly staff. Every hotel employee that we came in contact with (from maintenance staff to maids) sincerely asked how our stay was going and wished us a good day.

Indeed there was a somewhat surprising smell when we stepped off the elevator on our floor. The smell lingered in the hallway - but the rooms did not have an odor to them. The smell in the hallways seemed to be contained to the elevator area mostly and we didn't make a habit of hanging out in the hallways so it didn't affect our stay.

Riviera and Stardust Casinos are across the street. There is also a 24-hour Walgreens across the street. Denny's and McDonalds are within a block. The monorail is within walking distance. Conveniently located!</p><br></body></html>
