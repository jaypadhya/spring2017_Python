<html><head><h3>Royal Resort, Las Vegas Reviews Page 9</h3></head><body><br>Great price,service and location<p>Its not your most luxurious hotel, but extremely close. Its location at the beginning of the strip was amazing and the service was very hospitable. Rooms were decent sized and the balcony was great. The gambling pay out was awesome and the pool and cabanas were relaxing.</p><br>Excellent value for money and no resort fee!!<p>Lovely hotel, quick check-in, great rooms, great price, friendly staff, what more could you ask for?

I was also impressed that when we left our bags in the safe room we were asked to describe them before we could get them back, nice to know someone can't just take them!

The only complaint is the wifi, one day for $10 is outrageous, cheaper to go and use McDonalds up the road!</p><br>Convention Center Convenience<p>I attended a convention at the Convention Center and the hotel is a 12 minute walk from the venue. Convention Center has free parking, so actually driving made more sense in the 111 degree heat. The hotel is also located 1/2 a block from The Strip (close to the Riviera). Besides The Barrymore, hotel restaurant, there is a Denny's across the street through the Ross store. The room was clean and spacious. King size bed, table and chairs, additional lounge chair. Looks like a Murphy Bed was also available. Balcony isn't really a balcony, sliding glass doors that opened onto a rail to hang your pool towel. I used the pool one evening, very refreshing. Front desk folks were very friendly and helpful day and night.
Room Tip: 6th floor pool view. Very quiet.
See more room tips</p><br>An ideal poker players resort<p>Our second stay at the Royal; which should say something. We've stayed at all the big strip hotels over the years but when you remember that you mainly sleep there, we wondered why we spent the money.

The Royal is a time share resort of an average standard - probably a converted hotel from the 70's but it's fine. Check in is extremely fast, unlike the Venetian, the staff are helpful and you don't get any time share sales pitches at all.

Location is good being just 5 minutes walk from the Wynn poker room! And there is a Denny's just across the road which is perfect for breakfast at 3pm! Or dinner at 4am!!! Well, we play a lot of poker!

The room is as expected and as you see in the photos. Adequate comes to mind. A/C is standard and needed in the summer months and the mini fridge is a great help if you take tea bags and use milk...or beer!

Overall the place is clean, tidy, very quiet and the maid service is flexible...although our cleaner seemed unable to dust! Other than that a great place to stay at not a lot of money.

We'll be going back there again for sure!
Room Tip: If you expect to sleep during the day ask for a room on the opposite side of the pool.

Room Tip: Stayed here a few times city or pool view is your choice.

I was not too fussed by the need to stay at one of the big name hotels (and in fact every time I visited one of those, there were check in lines a mile long)

Royal Resort is about two thirds of the way down the strip near the Riviera - making it nice and central to most things. The property is a little dated, but I can't fault the staff, cleanliness or the price!

The other big advantage of being slightly away from the centre of the strip is that once you retreat to your room form the night - it is nice and quiet!

There is a discount ticketing outlet on site and right next door are a range of supermarkets, restaurants, liquor stores and convenience outlets.

The place felt safe enough and there are security guards on duty at night - and the walk to and from the main parts of the strip also felt safe.

I'd certainly consider staying again next time I am in Vegas.

I'd certainly</p><br>Great place, if you know what to expect<p>I've owned a timeshare at the Royal for at least 8 years, however have never actually stayed as a timeshare guest. However, we book and stay here at least once a year for a shorter stay (3-5 nights) and love it. Here's what it's not - it's not a casino property. It's not glitz and glam. What it is is conveniently located, sufficiently quiet and relaxed, but just steps away from fun, food and more. We love waking up and making our way to the Peppermill for breakfast. The restaurant in the Royal is fabulous and to my knowledge has become a very popular place for locals. The new hidden gem (or not so hidden) is the Tijuana Taco place in the strip mall right next to the hotel on the strip (not the real name, but you won't miss it if you ask anyone). The hotel also has a nice pool and spa out back. All in all, it's a nicely located, convenient property that is as clean as any normal hotel/motel across the country.</p><br>No Royal treatment here!<p>Booked hotel through Booking.com for a one night stay May 31st. Booked a SMOKING room and received a confirmation for our stay. Upon arrival we got to our room and found there was not any ashtrays. My wife called the front desk and was told that all smoking rooms had been taken. We informed the clerk we had a SMOKING room reservation and he again said they were out. Then suggested we just smoke by the patio door. Really? Normally it wouldn't be an issue except for the fact that ANY changes made by me to the reservation would have resulted in a $25 minimum fee. I think if a property expects you to stick to your reservation they should too! Patio is about an 18 inch extension with sliding door. A normal sized person cannot stand or sit outside. Our sink drain did not work properly. No Bell hop to assist with luggage and location is not that great. Limited Valet as well. After this I would rather stay at Motel 6. That sums it up and I don't usually stay at Motel 6 for a reason.

Consear was great because he had lots of great information .Room was nice and had a balcony.it was nice to be able to stand out side on are on balcony.would definitely stay there again.</p><br>Decent hotel, close to Convention Center. <p>The Royal was a decent hotel, nothing terribly fancy. It's obviously an older establishment, but the rooms were pretty clean. I've stayed here twice in the last few years.

Booking in took about 10 minutes, as there was only one agent at the desk who was constantly distracted by her cellphone.

The rooms were Vegas-typical, nothing to write home about, but comfortable enough.
The restaurant on-site was way to pricey for us, so we opted for some in the vicinity (within a block or two).
Located in a sort of run-down section of town, which is currently undergoing renovations, the views and neighborhood definitely lacks appeal. The Convention Center was about 5-10 minutes away walking time, dependent on traffic. Flagging down a cab is most difficult as local ordinances prohibit cabs from picking up passengers on the side of the road; the front desk did call a cab for us and a few other groups of folks who were waiting, but it was sort of a free-for-all when they finally showed up.

If you're looking for a relatively inexpensive hotel close to the Convention Center, you could do worse... But could probably justify a few more dollars and stay a block closer in one of the major chain hotels.</p><br></body></html>
