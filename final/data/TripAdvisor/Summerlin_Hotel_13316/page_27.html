Very large rooms. Quite a distance from the strip, but that is reflected in the price. Good breakfast selection.
Room Tip: This property is several blocks from the interstate and does not face a major highway. All rooms sh...

The front desk person tried to get my into another hotel and found a room at a Holiday Inn. However, the front desk clerk at this Hampton and the one at the Holiday Inn did NOT know how to make the transaction!!!!??? So I was told to wait for the hotel manager at the Hampton Inn who they could not locate. So I got on the phone with Hilton and a customer service rep was able to get me into another Hampton in the area. It is important to note that I was told that ALL Hilton Hotels and affiliates were booked. Well apparently that was not true for there were rooms available at the Hampton in Speedway in Las Vegas per Hilton Customer Service. I have made a formal complaint with Hilton regarding this issue. The manager of the Hampton Hotel Red Rock did finally show up and gave me a free night at the other Hampton. No apology however. Id recommend to Hilton to changer their staff at the Hampton Inn Red Rock and rectify the situation as soon as possible. In the meantime, id avoid this hotel and stay somewhere else.</p><br>Very good Hampton Inn<p>Stayed in a king room and not a suite and was surprised that there was no refigerator or microwave but at least plenty of ice for our cooler. When you opened the luggage rack in the closet it would not fit in the closet so you have to place it in the room. Very stylish hotel, lobby area with breakfast area along with the room. Hard to adjust the temp in the room. Convenient location near sites to west of Las Vegas like Red Rock Canyon but also easy to get to Strip. Would stay there again when in the area.
Room Tip: Ask for a top floor room to the east to see the Strip.

Hotel was near some shopping but really needed a car to get around the area. Bus access to the Vegas strip was excellent and service very regular double decker buses and the drivers were very friendly and helpful. Breakfast could have been better for the price we paid $125 night. I was disapointed at the high rate my guess is it was because of the tournament. We could have found something much cheaper closer to the strip. Hotel dealt well with our soccer team. Front desk was very obliging and helpful. Rooms were average nice beds, but had no fridge which would have been helpful as most people bring in food for such events.
Room Tip: I was staying right next to the elevator and found the room very quiet given all the activity the so...
See more room tips</p><br>The room was much bigger than I expected.<p>My wife and I traveled to Las Vegas this year to be with family for Christmas. We are both Hilton Honors members and we used our points to book this stay. The location was nice as it's very close to the 215 loop and that makes greeting around Vegas much easier. Check in was fine we went to our room. It was a Jr Suite I guess because it had a wet bar area in the entrance with sink, microwave and mini fridge. There was the standard in-room single serve coffee maker. Then the rest of the room was huge with a seating area with a couch and coffee table, a very large work desk and a king size bed. It was nice to have so much room. The dressing area with the sink was nice and clean with the closet with full length mirrors. The tub/toilet room was clean and everything worked fine. They also gave us a room all the way in the back of the building. It was quiet and easy to get to from the back door and parking lot. So we were very pleased with the room. Now, there were some things that need some attention. My wife and I are both allergic to goose down. As soon as we got to the room, I checked to see if there were some extra pillows in the top of the closet. Most hotels will have a couple of foam pillows up there for the people like us that can't sleep with the way too soft goose down. No extra pillows so I call the front desk to ask about getting some. The desk clerk says, um no, we don't have any foam pillows and no one has ever asked for them before. Really? Then she says "there's a Walmart across the street, you could go buy some pillows I guess". So that's what we ended up having to do. And lastly, I have to agree with a previous reviewer, the complimentary breakfast is really horrible. Muffins and bread that was hard and had to be days old. The "omelet" was something from outer space. So just just had coffee and we went out to eat. Overall, a good stay.</p><br>Just like other Hampton Inn's-excellent!<p>We visited this HI because we were visiting friends in the area. Service was excellent, rooms were clean and comfortable. As in an earlier review the room was freezing until we turned down the thermostat. Food was good for breakfast and kids enjoyed the Belgian waffles & cereal. Would stay here again if in the area:

Pro: location off freeway, breakfast included, served coffee & tea all day
Cons: small exercise room, jacuzzi would be nice</p><br>Surprises in the Morning<p>Although I've stayed at this hotel numerous times, this visit was definitely lacking. First, when checking in, the room was 57 degrees F. It was inhospitable at that temperature; apparently the thermostat had been set to off, and the weather was really cold, hence the room temperature. Additional pro's and cons:
Pros:
* Free wireless access
* Widescreen TV
* Free hot breakfast provided downstairs - with belgian waffles included
* They were very hospitable in offering a late check-out when we asked.
Cons:
* Shower only worked in mega massage mode - too hard to even shower in, much less wash my hair. Tried many times to adjust the Waterpik showerhead, to no avail
* Only decaf coffee was left for the coffee maker; had to call the front desk to get non-decaf.
* Beds are only sort-of comfortable - not soft enough for my liking, and with scratchy sheets, and what seemed like fake stuffing pillows
* Towels were rather threadbare and not pristinely white. They should change their laundry service.
* Breakfast was lackluster - "omelets" that were pre-prepared, and resembled what you might get on a plane; oatmeal that had clearly been prepared hours before; maple sausage that was less than appealing; yoplait yogurts (but none were sugar-free); muffins that were very dry; fruit salad with oranges, grapes and melon, and a few other things. We didn't have the waffles, although in the past, they have been quite good (make them yourself). All in all, the breakfast wasn't that appealing.

Bottom line - the hotel was very empty; maybe it does better with more guests. I probably won't stay here again (you would think being as empty as the hotel was, they would offer a free upgrade to a room with a mini refrigerator to a good Hilton Honors guest). I have heard The Element by Westin is very competitively priced, and will check that next time.
Room Tip: In the summer, ask to have a room on the opposite side from the fitness club next door.

It was clean, had very comfortable beds, good hot breakfast -- all of the things Hampton is known for. But, we were MOST impressed by the extremely friendly staff at the hotel. Their service was above and beyond what we expected, and they were consistently helpful and always smiling. We were very impressed by the efficiency and friendliness of Gloria, who serves breakfast. Not only did she keep all of the breakfast items fresh and stocked, but she also showed a genuine interest in each guest who came to eat -- always offering to do anything she could to make theirs a better experience. Francisco at the front desk, Mary who cleaned our room, and even the maintenance man (who hooked us up with a refrigerator for our stay) were all awesome as well. The quality of the staff make a huge difference at any hotel, and in this case, they made a very positive impression!</p><br>Good for off strip<p>We chose this hotel as we were spending most of our time away from the strip and wanted a non-gambling, non-smoking hotel. It was fine for our purposes. The location was hard to find at first, and the area has a definite residential/strip-mall feel to it, but overall it was fine. The beds are super comfortable and it was very quiet.

My only complaint would have been the breakfast. The hotel doesn't appear to have a kitchen or restaurant and providing a "hot" breakfast means food prepared elsewhere. We just stuck to the bagels and a yogurt, which is ok for us, but I think the hotel should stick with a continental breakfast and not try to do too much. The eggs and sausages looked inedible. For us, quality is much more important than quantity and we're not a fan of sweet muffins, danishes, and other pastries for breakfast.

Along that line, the hotel only uses disposable dishes -- paper cups, foam plates, plastic cutlery, etc. A huge amount of waste and in conflict with the environmental sustainability image Hampton is appearing to project.</p><br>All Good &amp; What You Would Expect from Hampton<p>Stayed here for weekend soccer tournament with a bunch of other teams from Idaho. No complaints other than one of the elevators smelled funky but that was no biggy. Naturally the whole place was pretty loud with all the kids running around but not excessive. Our room was clean and as we would expect it. The morning breakfast was awesome and the lobby area is set up well for group get togethers. The computer in the business center worked perfectly. The staff did a great job and were very responsive to requests. Outdoor pool was open and the kids enjoyed it. Easy access to Flamingo Rd & 215. Lots of good restaurants real close by and a Target. Would definitely stay here again.</p><br></body></html>
