<html><head><h3>Hampton Inn & Suites Las Vegas-Red Rock/Summerlin Hotel Reviews Page 3</h3></head><body><br>Hampton's is always good<p>Bad point:
- area in construction / closed deadends roads
- far from the typical Vegas but everyone has a rental car when going to LV
- if you drink the cab may be expensive

Good points:
- decent price and cheaper than the Strip
- as always the breakfast, room is nice, all is as expected
- restaurants open late nearby / BBQ Famous Daves etc.
- free parking
- internet</p><br>Loved the Off-Strip location.<p>Newly renovated rooms. Spacious and quiet. Staff was friendly and helpful. Area is away from the Las Vegas Strip and all that crazy traffic. Nice to know you can always count on The Hampton Inn and Suites.</p><br>Great Hotel - Bad Location<p>The hotel is very good, and the staff is amazing. The only problem we encountered was due to the location. Cabs would not leave the strip to come get us since we were about 15 mins away. Not the hotels fault. . . just make sure you rent a car.</p><br>Hampton Inn ALWAYS great<p>I never seem to be disappointed when I stay at any Hampton Inn. It is my preferred brand out of all the Hilton brands, but I can always find a good bargain either way thru Hilton and AAA. Along with other promos that may be offered, Hampton Inn still comes thru</p><br>Messy &amp; Loud &amp; Stained Worn Carpet<p>Yes, they are renovating the hotel and one of the rooms we stayed in had just been renovated and essentially it was putting lipstick on a pig. The elevators "ding" loudly their arrival twice for each floor. Stay as far away from the elevator as possible. Due to renovation, beds and furniture were stored in the hallway just down from our room. Good breakfast.</p><br>Great breakfast<p>The breakfast was good at this hotel. I enjoyed waking up to run down and get some. The floor we were on was getting ready to be renovated so as people checked out furniture was placed in the hallway. It wasn't a problem, because it helped to know they weren't letting it get run down.</p><br>Comfortable, Quiet and Comvenient<p>Away from the chaos of the strip but convenient for Wet n Wild and excellent golf courses like Siena the rooms were comfortable and the breakfast and coffee all good. Some shops and restaurants nearby but would recommend a car is essentia</p><br>Hilton Family Hotels<p>As with so many of the Hilton Family Hotels we have stayed in this Hampton Inn was clean, quiet (even though they were renovating), and friendly. Our room was large and we would totally stay there again!!</p><br>Average Stay - Staff Uninterested<p>My stay at this hotel was average. Room was clean and lobby area was adequate. However, when I asked about restaurants, transportation to the Vegas Strip, etc., staff seemed uninterested and bored in their responses.</p><br>Redo<p>Clean the carpets! Update the ac. Use anther type of laundry detergent so the scent doesn't overpower when a guest is trying to sleep. Update the internet. It would be advisable to only perform the construction going on during the day since some of the guests are actually staying a the hotel and in the area for professional training and need to sleep! Warning you might end up staying in a room with work going above you during the night!!</p><br></body></html>
