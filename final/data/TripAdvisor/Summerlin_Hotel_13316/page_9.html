<html><head><h3>Hampton Inn & Suites Las Vegas-Red Rock/Summerlin Hotel Reviews Page 9</h3></head><body><br>Just right for the money<p>If you need to stay on the west side of Las Vegas, this hotel is just right. It's near 215, the price is very good (especially with AAA discount) and the included breakfast has decent variety and tastes very good.</p><br>Be careful where you walk<p>First room didn't have window covering; second room had path in carpet; shower stall had broken handle; watch out for "elephants" above you that keep you up at night & wake you early in the morning; look out for a racing treadmill; you may not get cable during your stay.</p><br>Don't Waste Your Money Here Until They Remodel<p>The location worked to be near family. The staff was friendly. The rooms were the worst Hampton inn I HAVE EVER STAYED AT!!!!!!!!!! Beat up furniture, nasty carpeting and the walls were marked. Stay away for now!</p><br>Good overall quality; excellent staff!<p>This hotel is a good value for the money. The staff is very helpful and friendly. The room could be cleaner; carpet was very worn and dirty. The linens seemed okay. The continental breakfast and complimentary internet makes the cost of the rooms okay. Otherwise the room value is more like a $69.00 value not over a$100.00, which is what I paid.</p><br>Great Stay<p>Stayed here for a night and nothing but good things to say. The property is very well maintained. Great place to stay with kids. Bed was very comfortable. Bathroom was super clean. I felt very comfortable in this hotel. The breakfast was also great! Usually hotel breakfast buffets are hit or miss. This was definitely a hit. They had good options to choose from even for the health conscious crowd.</p><br>Reliable<p>Typical of most all Hampton Inns, this one will suit you quite nicely. Beyond the good service and accommodation, the location is terrific for shopping, restaurants and reasonably quick access to downtown and the strip.</p><br>It is 43 degrees out, and the A/C is turned on in the hotel hallways<p>I am a very frequent traveler, and as another guest and myself exited the elevator, we both looked at each other in amazement (which is kind of odd for two strangers to do this.....). But we exited the elevator to feel A/C blowing on "full blast" right into the hallways. I actually walked up and down all of the floors and found that the A/C was turned on full blast, EXCEPT for the first floor where everyone walks in.

Not to harp on this, but I presented the front desk about this issue, and she remarked I was the first guest to complain about it. I asked her if she wanted to just ride up to any floor and see it for herself (it is quite obvious you are walking into a freezing hallway the moment the elevator opens). She then replied that she was the only person actually working at the hotel at this time; and that she couldn't leave the front desk.

I asked if she could just turn the heat on floors 2/3/4 (because yes, you can actually feel cold air coming in under your door). She then replied that she has no control over this/does not know how. I find this to be ridiculous, you work at a hotel, and yet you do not know how to adjust the temperature?

I asked if there was maintenance around to look into the issue, and then she remarked that maintenance will not be in for another 12 hours or more (I checked in at 7pm). We did a little back and forth. I inquired about just what do you do..........when you have a maintenance event or any sort of thing that requires attention after 5pm.......who do you call? What do you do? Do you just literally say, tough luck (as I was told tonight). She could move me to another floor; but not a floor with an actual heated hallway (the first floor is the only floor heated).

All of her answers unfortunately did not inspire much confidence in this hotel - or the Hampton Inn brand in general. This will make 174 nights this year that I have stayed in a hotel, and this hotel has probably been one of the top 5 least impressive I have had the opportunity to stay at. this year.

I just thought of something, maybe I should stuff towels under the door to try and block the flow of cold air! Wish me luck :)
Room Tip: The Element by Westin is brand new and costs the same. Yet they have a lot more to offer on this sid...

When entering the lobby was very clean the front desk was nice. The overall appearance was inviting. It was late at night we had traveled many hours for a funeral so asked for a quiet room and was given a room on the 4th floor (not by a ice machine) :-) When we entered the room we was actually pretty shocked at what we saw. The room looked very "old" the carpet looked dirty, the bed spreads looked lumpy, very lumpy, the bathroom vanity looked like it was from a garage sale, the TV was sitting on the dresser not even in a entertainment center (I know this is a little picky but just looked weird) The chair in the corner also looked like a garage sale find. Also there was a humming noise that was WOW crazy. We had turned off the fan on the AC because it was to noise and ended up turning it back on to help drown out the jet engine noise we was hearing. It was soooo bad. Just not what you would expect from Hampton Inn. More of a lower chain quality.</p><br>Not the Best Place to Stay in Vegas<p>The staff are very good at this hotel. However, the room we stayed in did not have a fridge. The lamp switches were loose or broken. The hair dryer was broken but the maintenance personnel were quick to replace the hair dryer. The air conditioner ran all night and was extremely loud. Carpet in the room was dirty and/or worn.</p><br>Close to Red Rocks<p>I stay in Hampton Inns and Hilton Garden Inns regularly. This was one of the best Hampton Inns I have stayed in. It was very close to Red Rock Casino Resort, where I needed to be for a couple of days. Very convenient, plus was away from the casino energy at night and in the morning.</p><br></body></html>
