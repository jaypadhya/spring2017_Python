The suites need upgrading as the wood furniture was very worn and somewhat outdated. The carpets were a blah dark brown and could stand to be updated as well. The beds were average comfort, and although the comforters looked and smelled clean, they had these freakish looking lumps of filler like they didn't put tennis balls in the dryer to fluff them up but it was all over purposely designed as such. Gross looking - took some getting used to. The complimentary breakfast was unexpected and they did offer a bit of everything... I personally was underwhelmed because I live for the fresh waffles but the waffle mix was not good (personal first world problem). There was no refrigerator nor microwave in the suite which was unexpected given the daily rate and hotel class - I can't recall the last time I stayed at a Hilton or Marriott property without a fridge. If you can score a $79 average rate, this is a great hotel option. I wasn't so lucky and will likely not return unless I find a rate reflective of the amenities.</p><br>Unpleasant Surprise<p>Have stayed at Hamptons before, always with a decent experience. This time different.
Hallways unkempt, carpet in room stained, worn and dirty. Lacks care generally. Drinking fountains have lime deposits. Not what you would expect from this chain.
Room Tip: See it first!

What a great experience and a great value! We'll definitely stay at a Hampton Inn again. The entire hotel, including the rooms, was very clean. The pool area and exercize room were both well-kept. The complimentary coffee bar in the lobby was so nice, and the complimentary breakfast was a FULL breakfast - not continental. We had so much fun.</p><br>Horrified Blood On Sheet<p>OMG. I am Gold Member. I travel weekly for business and stick to Hilton brands because they fall within our travel policy and are always in convenient locations. I booked this hotel because I was flying in for business. I will be flying into Las Vegas weekly for a project that ends in September. Not in the mood for "What Happens in Vegas....." type hotel, so I booked a family friendly Hampton Inn. Place is dated. Oh well. One night I will live. I checked in. Went to me first room. Yes first room. Situated behind elevator. Went straight back down. She gave me a different room. Went back up and remote did not work. "Really?" Ugh...called downstairs. Said need a new battery. She claimed she could not leave her post. I said OK. Ready to go downstairs, clerk called my room and said she would bring me a new remote because she has to go to another room to get it anyway. I said OK. As I went to one of the queen beds, I pulled back the comforter and sheet like I always do, and HORRIFIED, blood on the sheets. Freaked me out. Get me out of here. Called her back up and explained. She was as horrified as I was. Came back up with new keys and both she and I took pictures of the blood. Im here in room #3 typing because I am too grossed out to go to sleep. YUCK YUCK. Never coming back!!! Oh. Im not done. Will be send pictures to Hilton.com Corp Hear Quarters and will report to the Health Department. Trust me....dont come here.... GROSS. I told here this housekeeper needs to be fired. She said they probably will.</p><br>Terrific experience in Las Vegas<p>The Hampton Inn Red Rock/Summerlin is conveniently located to all of Las Vegas and provides an excellent services. It was quiet and comfortable. The staff were all friendly and efficient. We plan on staying there on all trips in the future.</p><br>Cash Stolen<p>300 dollars cash was stolen out of my room. When I told management about this they informed by that they have a lock box in the lobby I could use, that anything greater than a 20 dollar value should be locked up... I thought this was the entire point of having a locked room... I shall remember next time to lock up my shoes and pants since they exceed the "safety" value... service.. stolen money value.. 125 a night.. sleep quality... air condition was broken and over 114 outside.. location.. far from everything. rooms. clean</p><br>Super convenience in a hotel - in Las vegas!<p>Just a really great hotel, with wonderful staff and amenities. Close to everything one could need. Great swimming pool. Great little gym for that basic but intense workout when you're staying in shape on the road. I'll become a regular here.</p><br>Quiet hotel away from the strip<p>We stayed at this hotel while we were in Las Vegas for hockey. It was 5 minutes from the rink, and we were very happy with our stay. The room was very clean, the staff was friendly and helpful, and the hotel was very quiet.</p><br>Great Hotel<p>We stayed at this hotel twice at the beginning of our Southwest vacation and at the end before flying home. We stayed here instead of on the strip and saved a lot of money and the hotel has a lot of added value that you don't get on the strip.</p><br></body></html>
