<html><head><h3>Hampton Inn & Suites Las Vegas-Red Rock/Summerlin Hotel Reviews Page 19</h3></head><body><br>Great experience<p>short notice for a reservation Dante was so accomodating we had a problem with our heating at home when i called he was amazing will be back,my Kids love to stay at Hampton Hotels anywhere we go very happy to do business with you.</p><br>Disappointed<p>We have stayed in many Hampton Inns over the years and must say this is the first time we have been disappointed. The carpet in room was filthy as was the upholstered furniture. Comp breakfast was not up to par from what we have experienced at other Hamptons.</p><br>Hampton Inn Summerlin Las Vegas<p>We had a pleasant stay, all amenities excellent. Great breakfast! Rooms quiet and well insulated. Staff friendly and helpful! Location is close to major roads and within easy reach of the city. Close to nearby sights like Hoover dam, Lake Mead and the Red Rock Canyon area. Plenty of good restaurants within walking distance.</p><br>a<p>Very Good place, close to highway and redrock, plenty to eat around and next to the largest fitness center in Las Vegas ... It is also quite with plenty of parking space... Small pool and breakfast is nothing to talk about, but enough to get one going. Starbucks within walking distance</p><br>Hotel Review<p>This hotel was very clean and the staff was very outgoing and friendly and helpful. There were a lot of us staying there from all over. They were saints for having to put up with a lot of nurses and IT people.</p><br>Sewage<p>We were put into a room with a broken sewer line and when we complained maintenance KNEW OF THE PROBLEM. We had to demand another room. No apology for the inconvenience. BTW, I am a Silver member can you imagine the service if I were a casual traveler?</p><br>What?<p>Overall a nice hotel. location on west side of valley, close to Red Rock Valley. Good place to stay if you want to be away from the Strip. Lots of shopping,eating, and drinking near by. Small saloons close by with slot machines!!</p><br>Good and Bad<p>The breakfast is good, and the staff is friendly, but the bed, air conditioning, and bedding needs better monitoring for wear and comfort. The blanks were too think for use, and the air conditioing noisy. The wifi signal was weak on the 4th floor.</p><br>Not a recommendation<p>The carpet and room quality is not up to par. Although the breakfast and service was pretty good. The location was convenient to my employment....if it wasn't for that I would have ventured out to another Hotel.</p><br>So-So<p>If you like Hampton Inns, you may be disappointed.The non-smoking room had residual smoke smell (or something) and it had been a good while since any effort had been made to remodel or update it. We also thought we were going to be a little closer to the Red Rock Park but we were simply in the city. Canceled our remaining nights and moved on.</p><br></body></html>
