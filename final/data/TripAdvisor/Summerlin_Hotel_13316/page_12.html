<html><head><h3>Hampton Inn & Suites Las Vegas-Red Rock/Summerlin Hotel Reviews Page 12</h3></head><body><br>Check the bed sheets!!<p>This is a good hotel and a great location. I was here on a rock climbing trip at Red Rocks Canyon. The only disappointment was upon arrival and checking my bed, there was alot of hair on the sheets and pillow. It seemed like the sheets were not changed prior to the previous guest arriving. I called the front desk and asked for clean sheets to be sent up. When the porter arrived I showed him the hair on the sheets.</p><br>Family Reunion - Aug-Sep 2014 Labor Day<p>wow, so far from home, yet this property makes you feel at home. From the reservation request; duration of stay; until check out, FIVE days later, this is an awesome find. Close enough to get to the action, but far away enough to not have to deal with volumes of traffic. My husband is dependent on a wheelchair. The suite was perfect for mobility assist, plenty of room without obstacles and a roll in shower. The breakfast buffet, was superb,,, spotless, plenty of choices for the healthy minded,, spacious dining area and a decent hour. The staff, at this Hampton Inn property were like extended family, the friendly ones. :-) OK,, no trip goes without a snag. Our refrigerator quit. One call, and property folks were there the same day, diagnosed the refrigerator had a dead motor,, and a replacement was put it. Housekeeping daily, a perfectly fresh room every day. Ten stars! Professional, courteous, kind. Third stay in a year,, will always stay here.
Room Tip: we have stayed on several different floors. First floor is best for seniors. Easy access to everythi...

The breakfast was fantastic with something for everyone. Hot and cold choices. This was one of the best stays we have ever had anywhere. Everything was wonderful, people, accomadations, breakfast, cleanliness.....everything! The room was clean and comfortable away from the beaten path. Very happy with the entire experience.</p><br>Wonderful staff, comfortable beds<p>Everything I needed in a hotel. Very good rates with a great breakfast included. The rooms were older, but we had a great view of the mountains. Cleaned very well. We asked for extra towels and hangers which were furnished right away. Customer service is excellent. More than pleased and would stay again. Good News- remodeling in the future.</p><br>TOP NOTCH HOTEL<p>Everyone should eliminate their need to stay along the Strip and book at this hotel which is a short cab drive away. EXCELLENT service, room accommodations, awesome bed pillows, beautiful clean suite, complimentary breakfast, ample parking, grounds are clean, the best nights sleep and price. You have a lot of hotels to choose from in Vegas, of course, but put your mind at east by booking at The Hampton and you will not be disappointed.</p><br>Excellent but.....<p>All in all this hôtel was a good experience .:convenient , confortable ,spacious room and bathroom large The breakfast was quite good.
The only downside is that the invoice was not given,even upon request. The receptionnist pretended that Booking.com would email it, which was not true.Something weird,I wish the manager will give clarification.</p><br>Good stay, great rate<p>This was a good hotel stay with a lot of great restaurants close by. You can enjoy the entire Vegas area without the hustle and bustle of the strip...for a small drive of course. It is well worth it for the small business trip I needed and the lobby is a great place to relax and enjoy a cup of coffee.</p><br>Every Year<p>For the past few years, have always stayed at this location in Las Vegas. Not too close to the strip, but not far either. Hence quiet, close to shopping complex. Easy access from Flamingo Road near 215 Beltway and a short drive from Red Rock Canyon. Breakfast good and staff always friendly. Seem to always get rate just below 100 dollars. Maybe not the newest of hotels, but does the job very easily.</p><br>Hampton Inn Visit 08/2014<p>Average atmostphere and lodging. The primary feature was the Inn's breakfast buffet. All told, it was a safe place to rest for my stay and will make tertiary consideration in future visits to the area.</p><br>Home Away From Home<p>Basketball team from Australia stayed for 8 days and found this stay their best accommodation experience during the tour of USA.

Central to our needs and 20 minutes to hub of city.

Rooms were clean, quiet and good standard and reasonably priced.
The Internet was amazing - considering the issues we had in other hotels.
Staff were friendly and very helpful.

The attention the boys were given by some of your staff, is sincerely appreciated by all our parents and players. This is best summed up by the following event – when walking through the Venetian I asked one of the players if they would have preferred to have stayed there with their parents, he responded with “no thanks, they wouldn’t bake us cookies and bring them to the pool and allows us to gather in reception to make our goodnight hot chocolate” . Need I say any more ?

Hampton Inn has certainly set the standard for the 2015 upcoming tour !!!
Room Tip: All suites are ground floor
