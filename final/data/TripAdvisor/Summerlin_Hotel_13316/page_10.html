<html><head><h3>Hampton Inn & Suites Las Vegas-Red Rock/Summerlin Hotel Reviews Page 10</h3></head><body><br>So so<p>Hotel staff were friendly and helpful. Check in and check out were fast and efficient. Room furnishings and carpet were dated and worn. Carpet in the room and elevator lobby were dirty, with path of travel clearly worn into carpet. Breakfast items OK. Internet OK. Parking convenient.</p><br>October 2014 Red Rocks<p>Out of all of the hotels in Las Vegas with my family, Hampton Inn at Red Rocks is the best. Located near restaurants and Target, and far from the traffic from the large casinos. Hampton Inns are pretty consistent in quality and service, so choosing the right location and accommodations are usually what you need to be concerned with. The price is usually pretty fair. However, this location is not convenient if you want to casino hop on the strip, unless you don't mind the cab fare or driving to nearby casinos/stations.</p><br>OK<p>Good location and friendly staff. Hotel needs to be remodeled. Carpets are stained and dirty and furniture is old and worn. Breakfast is good, but the coffee tastes terrible due to the taste of Las Vegas water. Does not meet the standard of most Hampton Inns that I have visited.</p><br>Using my Hilton Honors "rewards"<p>We made a trip for business to Las Vegas and I used my rewards to stay 2 nights on this hotel.. kind of dirty (furniture and carpets). Staff and breakfast was excellent... and what I did not like is that they charge me cash + all my points ... where similar hotels (or nicer) don't charge me a cent more.. only my points. +++ Super Far away from strip.</p><br>Worst Hampton Inn we have ever stayed at<p>Flew to Las Vegas on the 4th of October, 2014, intending to stay a full week. We stay at Hampton Inns when we travel, when they are available. All prior stays have been great, with clean and comfortable rooms that come with a microwave and a small fridge. We like the breakfast, the general atmosphere, and the nice people. ……… until now.

This Hampton had no microwave or fridge. (Never been to a Hampton that way…) The beds were just OK … barely. The carpets were terrible, both in the room and in the halls. They were stained, worn out, and ripped. Housekeeping didn’t change any towels one of the days there … and they WERE on the floor. The lights down the halls were all crooked, some had covers on right and some not. They didn’t even have the same color bulbs. Thought we were in a house of ill repute.

The man at the front desk said this motel was ONLY 6 years old!!! Looked more like 16 years old … or 26. We could have had a better stay at a Motel 6.

We cut our stay short, leaving three days early and we went elsewhere to finish our stay.

This place needs a complete makeover … and some management that cares about appearance. My wife and I used to run a motel in tourist country over 30 years ago … and we could still do better than this.</p><br>Always a Pleasure<p>I travel to Las Vegas a couple of times per month and always look forward to staying at this property. The staff is amazing, the rooms are clean and the parking is never an issue. If you are looking to unwind and want to stay away from The Strip, then this is the place to go.</p><br>Hampton Red Rock/Summerlin<p>Decent location but the rooms are not up to the usual Hampton Inn standards. The rugs were very stained and dirty looking, and overall the room and bathroom need some updating and freshening up. For a business traveler who is used to the steadiness of Hampton Inn quality and value, this location was far behind and unexpected.</p><br>This hotel needs a makeover<p>Very dissatisfied with the cleanliness of the hallways and rooms. THe lobby and location are great. The room's cleanliness was very disappointment. First room had a running toilet with urine splashed on the inside of the toilet seat cover. There was food on the floor in the seating area. The staff moved us to another room and the carpet was stained. We stayed one night and spent the remainder of our trip at the Springhill Suites.</p><br>Hampton Inn and Suites Hotel Great place to stay.<p>The stay here at the Hampton Inn and Suites Hotel was very comfortable . The staff was very pleasant and I have no complaints at all about my stay here. I would stay here again. I hope to return here some day for a vacation.</p><br>Once is enough!<p>I will start off by saying when we travel we only stay at Hampton Inn. I have come to expect a clean, reasonably priced room. This trip only the reasonably priced part was in the equation. We didn't mind being 15 minutes from The Strip but this Hampton is a little tired. I keep seeing reviews about it being clean......I would say that's really not the case. Almost everywhere we look we see things that need attention.....from the elevators to the halls to the rooms. For the 2 days that we have been here the floors in the elevators have been dirty. There are stains all over our walls, the carpet and furniture is worn, but I think the worst thing of our trip so far is the cockroach we just killed in our bathroom. Yup that's a first for us.....a cockroach in our room. When I went down to see if there was a manager on duty I was told no so then I explained what I found. The desk clerk told me when a manager would be in, apologized and then explained that they were do for a remodel soon. He then told me that the cockroaches come from outside and come up the stairs and there wasn't anything they could do. Seems like there would be a very easy fix....an exterminator. Since he had a reason for the cockroach, they must of had other problems. I understand the need for a remodel but some of the things we have noticed can be fixed with some good old fashion cleaning. On our next trip to Vegas, I don't think we will staying here. On a positive not the shower in our suite was really nice......except for the water that leaks through the bottom seal.</p><br></body></html>
