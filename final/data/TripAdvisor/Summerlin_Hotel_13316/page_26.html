<html><head><h3>Hampton Inn & Suites Las Vegas-Red Rock/Summerlin Hotel Reviews Page 26</h3></head><body><br>Needs work<p>The rooms in this hotel are not worth the price they are asking. The front desk clerks were the best. They were very friendly and knowledgeable. The rooms on the other hand are another story. Tried to take a shower, but took a shower/bath all at once. The tub filled up as I was showering. Yuk. Then when trying to close the closet door, which is made of glass, it would not stay closed. Walked right into it during the night trying to go to the bathroom. The room was not cleaned very well. Pubic hair was left on the floor after cleaning and paper that was left on the floor was just swept into the floor right in front of the bathroom door. There were three of us staying the room, but everyday the cleaning aide kept leaving 2 towels. No refrigerator and was not given a suite when that was what we were supposed to get.</p><br>Best Value New Hotel Wonderful Staff<p>This hotel looks brand new! The rooms are spotless! The staff is very helpful! The location is perfect for ease of access to hiking in the area and to the "hot spots" of Vegas via freeway. Love this place - right next to huge exercise complex also!
Room Tip: This is "off the beaten path" in Vegas so if you want the bright lights of the strip - thi...

But it's a transient hotel or one at least for transients. The property is old. It sites near an athletic 'club' and a number of large vacant lots. That said, it's quiet. Front desk staff esp. Sunni are really quite nice and friendly. Breakfast is rather sad but adequate for most and a real treat for those who usually stay at Rodeway Inns or Motel 6s. Carpets on the floors leading to the rooms are threadbare and dirty. The 'business center' is OK. The gym, not so much, Two worn out treadmills and an elliptical have seen better days. The rooms - and we had a suite - are at best barely OK. There are no pillows - I suppose they're called head cushions, which is a real turn off. The clock radio is bolted to the night stand. Towels are of poor quality and resemble those found at the gym across the street. Cable channels are limited. No glasses to be found anywhere; plastic and styro cups only. But the room came with a microwave and small refrigerator so that's a plus. All in all, a very good staff, hard working housekeepers, decent location but a very tired and outdated hotel with bare essentials for amenities (IOW nothing worth stealing) which would leave all but the transient disappointed. The Element by Westin just down the street at Town Center Drive is a much, much better option and we will stay there next time.</p><br>Flea bites<p>Hotel is conveniently located off I215 about 6-7 miles west of the strip. The staff was very friendly
but seemed a bit overwhelmed the day we arrived. They were trying to place a basketball team in adjacent rooms on the 3rd floor. Rooms are definately showing age and use. We were in 127 on the first floor. This was not the room I requested as I always request a room on a high floor away from elevators and ice/drink machines. As with other reviews, the a/c window unit was noisy and kept us awake most of the night. The worst part - (which I didn't notice until several hours after check-out) was the flea bites on both of my feet.
Room Tip: I doubt a tip would matter because hotels rarely read requests until the day of check-in. In our cas...

What really makes this hotel exceptional is the customer service. From the moment you walk into the lobby and are greeted by Anthony, you feel like it's going to be a good experience. He is professional, courteous, efficient and just a pleasure to speak with.
What makes the customer service Exemplary? Here's what happend to me. i checked out and left my laptop in my room. i didn't realize it until I left the laptop until i was going through the airport security. I called the hotel and spoke with Valerie. She was professional, pleasant and expedient in detrming if my laptop had been turned in. I told her I would take a cab to get it and that's when she said "I'll bring it to you." Within 20 minutes Valerie shows up with a smile and my laptop. She saved me the expense of a taxi and a new flight. This is absoultely the best customer service i have ever experienced. (Pete you need to give Valerie a big raise.) Check it out, it's a great hotel.</p><br>Good Value<p>Good location to explore Las Vegas beyond the Strip. 10 minutes from Red Rock Canyon for great views and hiking. There are many restaurant choices in the Summerlin area. I have stayed at this Hampton on business and personal trips. The staff is always friendly.</p><br>Disappointed<p>We have stayed at other Hampton Inns, and enjoyed the motel very much, but sadly we cannot say the same for our latest experience in Las Vegas (Red Rock/Summerlin). The room was certainly showing its age, and the air conditioning unit was so loud and rattling that we were unable to sleep with it on, but it was too hot to sleep with it off (Las Vegas in June....) The eating area at breakfast had overflowing trash receptacles, so there was nowhere to put plates, cups, etc. once done eating, which we were unable to do anyway because of the surprisingly poor quality of the food. There was also a very large contingent of a girls softball league staying there and checking in at the same time we were, but knowing this, they still only had one person working the desk, and the process was interminable. All in all, a very disappointing stay!!</p><br>Friendly, competent, nice hotel<p>While exploring Las Vegas I decided to take up base in various parts of the city, away from the Strip. I popped in at the last minute at the Hampton, and found Anthony and Sunni at the front desk to be very accommodating and delights at the counter. They set me up with a nice room facing east, looking toward the Strip -- which, though at a distance of several miles, was still impressive to see. The choice of room also enabled me to be woken up at sunrise and nab a couple of nice dawn photos.

Whereas I've experienced some difficulty obtaining speedy internet at some other Hampton locations, the Wi-Fi here worked fine. The breakfast was standard Hampton, but I especially liked the fact that the oatmeal was pre-mixed. My stay was hassle-free and I spent two nights at this location instead of the one I intended.</p><br>I expected more from a Hampton<p>The hotel is in a very residental area and we didn't see many choices for dinner nearby. The room was clean and modern and the check in staff was friendly and helpful with directions to the airport. Given a top floor, western facing room, on an afternoon of at least 103 degrees, had to keep the curtains closed, but I guess we weren't the only ones. AC worked well but a little hard to regulate - either too hot or too cold - 1 degree seemed to make too much of a change.

Business center consisted of 2 computers, which was nice, but one of them would not get you on the internet at all, so I had to wait until the other was free and use it. Not a big deal, but inconvienent at best.

Breakfast was less than desirable, employee was working, but things did not get wiped up and freshened up as it should have. Waffle batter all over the counter, butter packets swimming in water, burnt scrambled eggs, etc.

On the whole, it was okay, but my one major disappointment was not having a refrigerator. Most, if not all other hotels I have stayed in, of this level, all have mini fridges in the rooms (and usually microwaves too). When I asked at the front desk she said they have the fridges in the rooms with King beds, but since I had 2 Queen beds, I couldn't have a fridge. That made absolutely no sense to me at all. Just because I was traveling with a parent and didn't want a King bed, I can't keep my drinks cool? Dumbest idea Hampton Inns has ever had! It may be enough to have me shopping around to a new hotel chain for furture travels.
Room Tip: I never seem to get a choice, but if they let you have a say, I would asked for an East facing room...

Eateries and shopping are nearby. A shopping destination, Tivoli Village, is a short, fifteen minute drive. A small pool is available for cooling off. Hot or cold self-serve breakfast is included in the room rate and is available from 6-10am in the lobby. The beds and room are comfortable although the quilts are heavy. The air conditioning unit was a bit loud but the manager was going to have it evaluated when we mentioned it to him. Staff was very pleasant and accommodating, including a request for non-feather pillows.</p><br></body></html>
