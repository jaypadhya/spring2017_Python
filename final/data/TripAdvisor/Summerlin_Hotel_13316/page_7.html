Staff was super friendly and free breakfast was really good. The beds at this hotel were super comfortable, and all the parents were in agreement that they slept extremely well at this hotel.</p><br>Smoke free hotel in Las Vegas<p>The hotel was nice, clean and smoke free. It is about 20 minutes from The Strip. Close to tournament soccer fields if that is why you are in LV. The staff was outstanding. My only complaint is that the walls are very thin which made the room seem noisy. But, it was worth it to be in a smoke free environment.</p><br>I cannot believe they asked me to review this hotel publicly!<p>Dirtiest hotel I have ever stayed in (and that is saying something) The air conditioner sounded lie a train, the shower wouldn't drain and the carpets were black from dirt. We booked 10 rooms for business and each one was worse than the other.</p><br>Blech.<p>Rooms are tired and dirty. The carpeting was dirty and the walls scuffed. It looked like the room had seen one too many vegas hotel room parties. The staff, however, was friendly and helpful. If you need a relatively inexpensive place to stay in Summerlin area, and don't care about the presentation of the room then you could do worse.</p><br>Average experience<p>This hotel is in need of an upgrade. Love the signature white bedding provided by Hampton! That was the only thing to "love" here. Walls, carpets, doors, light fixtures etc. all need to be cleaned or replaced. Lots of noise travels from hallways, but not from other rooms or from the floors above/below. Other Hamptons in the LV area are more updated and provide more amenities for a similar price.</p><br>quality stay<p>Hampton Inn is a very good value for your dollar. The staff is very welcoming and helpful, the complimentary breakfast is one of the better ones I've experienced, the room is quiet, clean and comfortable, and the views are beautiful. Close to the city center and many dining choices, this hotel provides free printing, a morning paper, small workout room, pool, etc, for a competitive price.</p><br>Could be better<p>There was no refrigerator or microwave in my room. The ice machine was at the far end of the building. My in-room movies were not available my first night and then were $18.00 each the next day, a bit pricey for a movie. The room was a bit on the small side. The orange juice was watered down at breakfast. Other than that it was fine.</p><br>Las Vegas Option<p>I am a Hilton Honors member and was in LV for business. The hotel where our convention was being held was sold out and so I had to stay elsewhere. I saw the Hampton was close to where I needed to be. The hotel outside looks great. Pretty much what I expect from a Hampton. The room I was in was sort of dingy and looked as if it was in need of some TLC. The carpet was stained and worn looking-just not up to Hilton Hotel standards.</p><br>Decent for the location<p>If you need to stay on the west side of LV for business, this location is decent and convenient. The facility is better than a motel, but significantly less than a hotel. This isn't a destination for a family vacation and more for business travel, where you're not likely to be in your room much.</p><br>It's a room<p>Nice looking on the outside. Inside clean, but not fancy or elaborate. Room ok, 2 queen beds. Very comfortable mattress. Duvet covers not in very good shape so it gave the room a rather shabby, unkempt feel. It was clean & free of odors. I slept well.</p><br></body></html>
