<html><head><h3>Hampton Inn Las Vegas/Summerlin Hotel Reviews Page 34</h3></head><body><br>100% Satiisfied, 0% Excited...<p>We stayed here because it was offering rooms through Hilton HHonors on an
"Opportunity" Category basis, meaning 7500 points, which made it practically
free. I have no real complaints about this Hampton Inn, but there's nothing to
get excited about, either. The room size is nice, there's adequate work space
with free high-speed internet. Everything was spotlessly clean, and, as usual,
breakfasts are among the best of the free breakfasts in this category of hotel
(a bit better than Holiday Inn Express in my opinion). The exercise room was
small but well-maintained.
However, there are no meals other than breakfast either at the hotel or within
walking distance. The pool is tiny. The hotel is in a dull business park area
by a freeway. Getting to downtown or, worse yet, the strip is awkward,
especially during the ongoing freeway construction (the traffic was always
bumper-to-bumper). You don't get an upgraded room for being HHonors Gold (and I
had to remind them just to get the package of oreo cookies I was entitled to).
I certainly would have trouble understanding why one would stay here unless one
needed to be in the immediate area, at the prices they're asking (and certainly
at HHonors Category 3 that they're now under).
Hampton Inns offer a 100% satisfaction guarantee. If you're not 100% satisfied with your experience, you get your money back. There's nothing to be dissatisfied about this hotel--but not much to be excited about, eihter.</p><br>As long as you don't care what you get...<p>We made an on-line reservation for our family - 2 double beds in a non-smoking room. Got a confirmation that stated we had reserved 2 beds/non-smoking. When we arrived - we were given the key to a (really smelly) smoking room with one king-bed. I showed the desk clerk our confirmation but was told, "well, that's what they reserved for you and we don't have any other rooms...(shrug)" so at 11:30PM, with two exhuasted kids - we were scrambling to find a place to stay. As we were gathering our stuff to leave, another couple entered and asked, "Are you leaving? Is something wrong with this place?" and I recounted our experience. This other couple checked in and got a non-smoking room(?!) If they couldn't honor reservation, they should have sent me an e-mail or phoned. Apparently, what you reserve has no correlation with what you actually get...</p><br>Great Non Gambling place<p>Nice to be able to stay in a place thats not full of smoke and slot machines. Great staff and clean rooms. Better make your reservations as soon as you know you want to stay there (I got the last room at 4PM on a Tuesday) and the clerk said it was always that busy. There are nice shopping centers close by with Outback, Olive Garden, Walmart, KFC, Target, etc. Liked it so much, made a resv for last night b4 flight back.</p><br>Don't count on them!<p>I had a 3 day reservation: was informed after 2 days that I only had a 2 day reservation....and the rudeness started.... from the desk to tom the houseman ...if you are doing business, avoid this place like the plague!</p><br>Great non-gambling hotel.<p>This was a great place to stay, especially if looking to be away from the strip. It's not over crowded. The free business center is nice, as well as the juice and coffee. My kids enjoyed the 8 pm cookies.

The rooms are well-maintained and clean. No complaints. The breakfast, however, is very continental. But it worked fine. There are a few malls nearby and the strip is only 15 minutes away. Great choice.</p><br>a fine choice<p>We stayed here twice (at the beginning and end of our Southwest vacation), and it was a fine choice. It's not near the Strip or the airport, but they're only about 20 minutes drive. The property is clean and well-maintained; the room and bathroom are good sized; and the staff is friendly and helpful. The complimentary breakfast is generous, and there are tons of restaurants right nearby.</p><br>Excellente place, not too far from the fun, away from the noise<p>Excellent place to stay. OK, is far from the strip and downtown, but it depends on your reasons to be in Las Vegas. I went to a software convention and stayed al the Flamingo during the convention, then we moved for three nights to this Hampton Inn. We found the excellent service we have founf on other Hampton's like Houston Galleria. Clean rooms, good complimentary breakfast and peaceful zone. The restaurant nearby is also a very good choice for dinner.</p><br>Recommended.<p>I always stay here when I come to Vegas for business. They never fail to have clean rooms, a good business center, and a decent breakfast. They work well with special requests and the staff is always extremely pleasant.</p><br>Very pleasant experience<p>We have stayed at this hotel several times and have never been disapointed. I was pleasantly surprised on the little extras that the hampton Inn provides to make for a comfortable stay. The cookies and snacks are available throughout the day, newspaper every morning, great complimentary breakfast, the business center, fitness center, and attractive room. Very Reasonable rates.
Summerlin area is beautiful but wish the hotel was closer to the strip.
highly recommend it.</p><br>Christmas in Vegas<p>We came to Vegas to celebrate Christmas with relatives after the death of my Mother. We were treated with respect and dignity. We babysat our 2 little nieces and the entire staff went out of their way to accomodate our little ones. This is best place we have stayed in a long time. Highly recommend it to anyone.</p><br></body></html>
