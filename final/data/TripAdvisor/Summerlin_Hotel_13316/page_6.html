<html><head><h3>Hampton Inn & Suites Las Vegas-Red Rock/Summerlin Hotel Reviews Page 6</h3></head><body><br>Great accomodations<p>The hotel staff went out of their way to correct a problem during our stay. Since the problem was of a mechanical nature, they even sent the maintenance staff to address the problem at 11 o'clock in the evening! Wonderful people and wonderful hotel. We would recommend this hotel to everyone and it is the hotel we stay at exclusively when in the Las Vegas area.</p><br>Room was outdated<p>I chose this hotel since it was close to my meetings the next morning. The room furnishings was old and dated along with the carpet. Air conditioner was noisy. Lobby was fresh and seemed recently updated with paint, furnishings, and new flooring. They need to do the same to the rooms.</p><br>Poor Customer Service, clean rooms<p>The hotel room and pool were all clean and well taken care of. I was not impressed with the hotel staff. We arrived 1 hour early, and even though we had called ahead and told them we would be arriving early, were not allowed to check-in until exactly check-in time (3:00). We were told our rooms weren't ready, but at 3:00, all of the sudden, 5 rooms were miraculously ready?? I felt like the hotel staff was just trying to prove something, and messing with us. It was very frustrating as we had a family event we needed to be at.</p><br>Great Value<p>For $339 we stayed three nights in one of their king suites. We couldn't have asked for a better value. The room was clean, the staff was friendly, and the location was great. We were 15 minutes from the strip and 10 minutes from family. It's convenient to target, McDonald's and a few sit down restaurants.</p><br>A quiet corner of Las Vegas<p>We were surprised by the quiet surroundings despite being in a commercial area. A grocery store (Alberson's) was nearby for anyone who needs to stock up for a stay or further travels. We were not there to see the familiar Las Vegas sights, so the location away from the Strip was ideal.</p><br>Nice Bed<p>The comfort of the bed alone would be worth staying at this hotel. The room was very quiet and clean. Good restaurants within walking distance of the hotel with a variety of options and was also close to shopping.</p><br>Excellent and well placed<p>Well positioned for golfers, several golf courses are nearby. Lots of eating options with several craft brews and shopping near the hotel. Just off the highway and an easy drive to the airport. Quiet area without a lot of traffic made getting around a lot easier.</p><br>weekend stay<p>i wasnt looking for a LV strip experience, just a htel that was comfortable for rest, good free breakfast, with a straight shot to major casinos. need a car if you want to get anywhere. lots of food int the area and right next to la fitness.</p><br>Not what it used to be<p>Although this hotel was clean it was not up to the standards that I have come to associate with Hampton. The carpet needs replaced the shower had a large crack running down the wall in it. In a city where I could of had my pick of hotels I picked the Hampton because of the quality and sense of pride which was always evident when I have stayed in Hamptons. I was a little disappointed . I wouldn't stay there again. I could of gotten the same quality for less else where.</p><br>VERY GOOD HOTEL<p>The hotel is located in a very nice area of Las Vegas. All personnel and services is excellent. There was well used furniture in my room that could use replacing or refinishing and some carpet cleaning. A daily $10.00 "Occupancy Tax" is a little out of line.</p><br></body></html>
