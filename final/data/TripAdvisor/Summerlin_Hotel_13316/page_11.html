I love the location and the staff. Our trip was perfect for business travelers and people who want to stay away from the strip. I will stay here again in the future.</p><br>excellent hotel staff and clean room<p>I stayed over a week at the Hampton Inn and had an excellent experience. The front desk staff was very helpful and remembered me from the moment I checked in. Room was clean and quiet. I would highly recommend this hotel based on cleanliness and location.</p><br>Rode hard and put up wet<p>This hotel looked thrashed throughout, the carpets, walls, wallpaper, doorways were abused. The outlets in the rooms did not all work (had to unplug a lamp to charge my laptop). They had post-it notes (2) on each bed assuring that the comforter had been washed - I understand, it was startling at first to see something so lumpy but that happens to down when it is washed. I was ok with that. Bed was ok. Hotel overall had kind of a funky sickly odor (probably from drunk people).</p><br>Nice Las Vegas Stay, Away from the Commotion<p>We made a trip to Las Vegas recently for a family birthday party, which was located in west Las Vegas. I didn't want to stay on The Strip; it wasn't that kind of Vegas trip. So, I found the Hampton Inn, just about a mile from the neighborhood where the birthday party was to be held. It was easy to find: Off the 215 at Flamingo, left to Grand Canyon Drive (entry is on Grand Canyon).

The girls working at the front desk couldn't have been any friendlier! They welcomed us warmly with a lot of personality. Our rooms were on the 1st floor, not far from the lobby (120; 122). The rooms were very clean and nicely furnished. The bed was made with a (somewhat lumpy) duvet; there was an interesting sticky note on the headboard that said, "Duvet covers & sheets are clean for your arrival." Whew...clean sheets!!!

The room had a nice desk area and the WiFi is free. There is also a lap desk, for use while sitting on/in the bed. One negative were the drapes. A first-floor room is convenient, but it would have been nice to have privacy drapes (sheers) so that guests could get some natural light into the room without opening up to anyone in the parking lot. The black-out drapes were the only ones there.

The bathroom had a large stall shower and granite-topped, free-standing vanity/sink. For a shorter person or child, the countertop/sink would be SO high! It was kitchen-counter height and, the sink itself was set back on the counter about 6". Other than that, the bathroom was nice with a shelf below the vanity for personal items. A coffee maker was housed in its own inset-shelving area behind the door. Amenities were Neutrogena brand (shampoo, conditioner, lotion, soap). A hair dryer was on the wall.

While we were relaxing in the room in the afternoon, the fire alarm went off. You WILL hear it in case of an emergency...it was LOUD! Hotel guests left their rooms in an orderly manner and waited outside until it stopped. There was never any explanation or "All Clear"...it was over and we went back inside. Apparently, it was a false alarm.

While waiting outside during the "fire drill," I checked out the pool area. It is a small pool, with a deck surrounding it. No frills or ambiance there. It basically sits adjacent to the lobby, in the parking lot. However, with the summer temperatures in Vegas over 100 degrees, I'm sure it is a welcome sight!

The complimentary breakfast was quite nice! Eggs (scrambled or boiled); sausage; waffles; yogurt; cereals; oatmeal; juices; breads; more. Coffee always seemed to be available in the lobby.

There are many places to eat nearby and retail stores aren't far either. I would stay at this Hampton again and would recommend it to anyone who has a reason to be out in west Vegas or who doesn't like the hustle bustle of The Strip or Downtown Vegas.
Room Tip: If you like to have your drapes open, ask for a room that is not on the first floor.

There was one employee that was defiantly " the best". Her name is Sunni. Appropriately named I'd have to say. Sunni is very pleasant and helpful.</p><br>Away from the Strip<p>Was in LV for a funeral and didn't want to be on the Strip. This location was perfect for our needs: quiet area; close to restaurants, basic retail, and grocery. The staff was friendly and helpful. The breakfast was better than most other inns: cheese omelet, sausage patties, breads, cold and hot cereal, eggs, yogurt, waffles... Climate control was a little wonky. The difference between 72 and 73 degrees was either the Ac or heater. Too cold, too hot. Had to adjust the temp often. But maybe it was just me and I didn't know how to work that particular unit. Overall, a good stay and can recommend it for all types of travelers: business, families, etc.</p><br>Staff outstanding<p>I know what to expect when I book a Hampton in the US. Great rooms, good (free) breakfast, free wi-fi and the fridge and microwave in the spacious and very clean rooms.

However, this Hampton outstripped all the others we stayed in this trip. The staff were just brilliant - knowledgable on the area, and the attractions we would go to on the rest of our holiday even some that were several hundred miles away. Very friendly without being intrusive.

I would go back in a heartbeat!
Room Tip: Rooms facing the north get the most shade and in summer this was just super-practical. Also park on...

The carpet in our room had huge stains and looked very filthy and unsanitary. The bathroom looked well used with some mold around the shower. The elevator looked and sounded like a freight elevator. Most Hampton Inns are so nice we want to spend time in the room relaxing, but this property was unpleasant enough that we left quickly in the morning never looking back as we drove away. The poor quality of the property did not match the high price for the room. On a positive note, the breakfast was quite nice and it is fairly close for driving to the Vegas Strip.
Room Tip: make sure it is far away from the loud elevator
See more room tips</p><br>Good last leg of Vacation<p>The hotel was near the Red Rock Canyon area and the Red Rock Casino. Many restaurants were nearby. The desk person the night we checked in was friendly and helpful about internet access and nearby restaurants. The breakfast was very good. We had a very enjoyable stay</p><br>Our Stay<p>It is a very nice Hotel and everything was in Tip Top Order. I would stay at another Hampton Inn if there was one in the town I was going to be in and it was close to where I needed to stay for Business or pleasure.</p><br></body></html>
