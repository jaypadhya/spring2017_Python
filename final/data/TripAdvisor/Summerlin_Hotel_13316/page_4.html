<html><head><h3>Hampton Inn & Suites Las Vegas-Red Rock/Summerlin Hotel Reviews Page 4</h3></head><body><br>stains everywhere and no air conditioning<p>Very very tired hotel with little or no air conditioning in the rooms!! The 2 rooms that we were assigned on the 4th floor had stains everywhere----I could not believe this has a Hilton product. I would not recommend staying at this property.</p><br>Back Again<p>Traveled last few years to Vegas and always stay at this hotel, not far from the strip or Red Rock Canyon. Breakfast is good, rooms are clean. Good staff. Hotel is starting to show it's age; undergoing renovations</p><br>Friendly staff, comfortable accommodations<p>If you're seeking to escape the hustle and bustle of the strip, but still want comfort and convenience, this place is for you! The staff was very friendly and helpful, from the front desk to the breakfast team to housekeeping. They took care of everything that I needed and always had a positive response for every request. The AC in...
More </p><br>really nice experience<p>short stay. The staff was friendly and accomidating. The rooms were clean and very comfortable. For the price you cant beat it. And breakfast is included. The staff at breakfast were helpful and cheerful which is always nice. The staff really seemed like they enjoyed their jobs.</p><br>Convenient hotel, nice staff<p>It looks like they are in the process of refurbishing some of the hotel. The staff was friendly and the price was reasonable. The lobby coffee was good. I had to rush out, so I grabbed a breakfast bag, and it was ok. Got my room upgraded for free and it was spacious in the room and had a sitting...
More </p><br>Retiree working stay<p>Went for a union meeting and was looking for a quiet stay out near Red Rock National Park. The breakfast was wonderful and room was comfortable. The Staff seemed to care about making our stay feel worth our cost. It is a hotel that takes a little determination to get to, you have to circle around to find the access...
More </p><br>Dirty Condition of Rooms<p>Filthy, smelly carpet in my room, beat-up furnishings, bath tub dirty. Had to turn off air conditioning due to room odor. Very dissatisfied! Will NOT recommend this location! The room charge was exorbitant due to the uncleanness of this room. Road entrance to this location was hard to find.</p><br>Have a medical condition - find another hotel!<p>If you have any kind of medical needs, look for another hotel. I had medicine that needed refrigeration and was told that they have 3 units for such purposes but all 3 were out for repair. Thank goodness I had family in the area that I could use their refrigerator. I asked for a sharps container which is the proper...
More </p><br>Not a typical Hampton Inn<p>Staff was nice but room was in the worst condition I have ever stayed in. Reminded me of a bad motel you would see on TV. Stained, worn and ripped carpet, badly worn furniture and the AC made so much noise it kept waking me up. Hotel in bad need of a remodel.</p><br>Condition Disappointing<p>,This hotel was about what I expected from Hampton Inn with the exception of the carpeting in the room. The carpeting in our room was the worst I have ever seen. It should never have been rented to a guest in that condition.</p><br></body></html>
