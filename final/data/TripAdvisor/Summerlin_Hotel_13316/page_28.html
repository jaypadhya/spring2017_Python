Overall it was very clean and well maintained.</p><br>Definite bang for your buck<p>I just spent the weekend of Oct. 21-23 at this Hampton Inn. It was great! I last stayed here one year ago and thought it was great then too. The front desk staff are EXTREMELY helpful and go out of their way to assist the guests. I was able to check in early, about 11:00. The room was always cleaned by my return each day (noonish). I stayed in a clean/fresh looking room which was quite large. It had both a king & pullout sleeper sofa plus a mini fridge/microwave. The breakfast was good, the view of The Strip was great, the location to The Strip was 10-15 minutes away with a wide variety of restaurants nearby too. The price was low for so much!
Room Tip: If you're traveling with a child/teen get a room with a king & pullout sofa sleeper because...

We had a minor problem with the first room we were assigned, there were loose parts to the toilet paper holder laying on the table as we entered the room. The front desk person promptly reassigned us to another room, and apologized for our trouble. It was a really good stay, and we would definitely stay here again.</p><br>Quiet, comfortable, perfect off strip respite<p>Excellent hot breakfast, nice room, good view of mountains only 10 minutes from the Strip but much more relaxing
Room Tip: Great price on line for prepaid room
See more room tips</p><br>Love the hotel<p>My friend and I had a wonderful time at the Hampton's hotel. The hotel was cleaned and quiet. We stayed in the suite and the experience was great! The housekeeper cleaned our room every morning. The breakfast was great! In fact when I arrived at noon, I was afraid that my room wouldn't be ready in time for my arrival. But the ladyat the desk was pleasant and had my room ready as soon as I got there.

I gave the hotel four stars instead of five because I ran into manner problems. One problem was when I asked the staff if the shuttle goes to the strip, I was told no. However, the breakfast attendent told me the day I was supposed to checkout that they do take customers to the strip. I was upset about that.

The second problem was I got lost driving to the airport to pick up my friend on hwy 215. So I called the hotel thinking they will be knowledgeable about the airport since they are ten minutes from the airport. When I called to ask for the exit, the gentleman put me on hold for ten minutes trying to get me directions. I think it was better for him to have told me he didn't know how to direct me to the airport than to have me on hold for ten minutes.

Thanks
Room Tip: Stay away from the ice machines and closer to the backyard to see planes landing...
See more room tips</p><br>Not a Good Experience<p>Staff was not very friendly or helpful. I waited at the check in counter for about 10 minuets as there was no one behind the counter and no bell to call anyone. I am a Gold Card member and was not greeted as a Gold Card member. The room was uncomfortable, (matters was hard, furniture was cheep and uncomfortable). Tile floor in the bathroom and Kitchenette area's where scuffed and dirty. Towels and washcloths were gray and scratchy. The shower curtain smelled sour like body Oder. We were there for 5 days and washed our cloths before leaving and the laundry room was unbearably hot as there was no air conditioning at all in the laundry room. The laundry room did not have a garbage can to empty the lint filter into and the desk could not provide us with change for the machines.
Overall a very disappointing stay. We always pick Hampton Inn as they have always been the greatest for value and comfort, unfortunately that was not our experience here.</p><br>Needs Preventive Maintenance!<p>We are Las Vegas residents and needed a nearby hotel for a couple of nights so chose this Hampton Inn because it is rather new. We are HHonors Gold members and have stayed in many Hampton Inns. The check-in was flawless and the staff pleasant. The hallways were HOT and the walls in the hallways and our rooms (we stayed twice) were dinged up and marked...something a little elbow grease would clean. The carpet in our room on our second stay was FILTHY. The breakfast utensils for serving had dried food on them and the entire setup just didn't seem clean. Management needs to get on top of the maintenance of this hotel or it's going to be in sad condition soon!</p><br>Excellent Customer Service makes this hotel a great place to stay!<p>When you feel like your needs are the priority of a customer service reps, you know you are in the right place. Simple questions like " where should I eat?" and " how do I get there?" were promptly handled with a smile. Thank you for making our stay in Las Vegas comfortable.</p><br>Excellent service, nice rooms, good amenities, some noise.<p>Rooms, complimentary breakfast and other amenities were all very good and at least on par for similar hotels around Vegas. Service was excellent, particularly when dealing with a noisy neighbour (tv on very loud all night). We were moved to a quieter room. Our original room had a door connecting to another suite which allowed a lot of sound to transfer between rooms.</p><br>Just like home<p>This hotel was excellent. My entire family stayed here, 4 children under 6 and 6 adults. We had 3 King suites with the hideabeds suited us to a tee. The entire staff made us feel like we were family. The breakfasts filled up the children and satisfied the adults. The variety of food also helped since we stayed for a week. The front desk and food attendant went out of their way to welcome us. They used our names and made us feel right at home. The hotel was very clean and the pool was very warm and inviting for the group. All in all it was a very memoral 70th birthday celebration for me and my entire family. We will be back next year! Well done Brian and Cindy and thanks.</p><br></body></html>
