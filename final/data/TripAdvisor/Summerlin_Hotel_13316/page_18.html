<html><head><h3>Hampton Inn & Suites Las Vegas-Red Rock/Summerlin Hotel Reviews Page 18</h3></head><body><br>Nice room - bring your own snacks<p>I have stayed here multiple times and I like the suite rooms best. However, be aware that there are no healthy snacks in the "pantry" near the front desk. The only choices were packaged chips (all fried), nuts roasted in oil, and candy, cookies and ice cream. Even Sun Chips or fruit would have been good alternatives but there were none. There is a Target within walking distance, but still, the hotel should do better for its guests.</p><br>What's that smell?<p>I stayed here for the CES show. It's located in a nice and quiet area and is only about 15 minutes from the strip. Upon entering the room, I could smell something weird coming from the bathroom - not sure if it was from the cleaning chemicals or something else. So I opened the window a bit and it got better. The next day I could smell the same thing after returning to my room. Since I was only staying for 2 nights, I didn't bother to change the room. But this definitely shows that the room was not being properly cleaned or maintained. Also the AC/heater is too loud, so I just turned if off when I went to sleep - another negative point about this place. However, its kitchen staff was great and they do offer different varieties for breakfast.</p><br>Great accommodations close to the strip<p>I have stayed at this Hampton Inn in the past and enjoy the clean and comfortable accommodations while still being close to the Strip without the hustle and bustle of a casino hotel as I usually am traveling with my family. Nice accommodations and good location to restaurants and I-215 bypass so getting to the casinos is an easy drive.</p><br>Emergency Stay<p>My nephew was in a near fatal car accident and was in the UMC ICU for a week. I was able to book a room with little effort and reasonable rates over the New Years holiday. It was an excellent home away from home with excellent hotel staff and location !! I'll stay here again without question</p><br>Excellent Accomodations<p>I have stayed in hotels around the world and this Hampton Inn rates as one of the finest I have ever had the pleasure to visit. Both the quality of the accommodations and the professionalism, friendliness, and helpfulness of the staff definitely exceeded my expectations.</p><br>Hampton Summerlin<p>Nice, clean, typical Hampton. We stayed one night, mostly trying to avoid the LV Strip area, and also to be near the Red Rock Canyon. We're into hiking and it's a great recreation area with numerous trails and points of interest along the scenic drive within the park. The Hampton Summerlin is minutes away from from the park and provides clean, comfortable accommodations along with a free hot breakfast to start your day.</p><br>Don't Stay Here! Avoid at all Costs<p>This hotel is awful. The carpet is so filthy and the breakfast is very sweet and commercial. I was so disappointed in service and my room was freezing. I was moved to the room next door and it was in the same condition. In addition, the bedding was lumpy and the blanket was paper-thin and felt awful, not soft, warm or comfy at all.</p><br>DIRTY CARPET<p>I am a Hilton Hhonors Diamond member and have stayed in many Hampton Inns. Management needs to step up. The carpet is dirty. It's dirty in the hallways and the rooms. It's amazing to me how management style affects each property. You can stay in one within a few miles of another and the difference is remarkable.</p><br>Worst Hampton Inn ever!!!!!<p>Dirty Dirty Dirty!!!!!! Carpet was soiled it almost looked like dirt was spread across the room. It was a beige color. A clump of hair was under the sheets when we went to go lay down. Vomit on the drapes!!!Yuck!</p><br>super friendly staff<p>The best staff at a Hampton Inn I have encounterd aover many years of travel. This location has incredible location, quiet off the strip. And walking proximity to many restuarants and shops. Definitely worth staying..</p><br></body></html>
