We found out the thieves had hit the parking lot the night before as well. There are no parking lot video cameras and the thieves are well aware of it. Do not stay here!</p><br>no security<p>This hotel is located next door to a 24 hr gym, during our 1 night stay 3 cars were broken into during the early morning hours. This location needs lots of security and has none, no cameras, no patrol, nothing.</p><br>Fool me once...<p>I stayed at the property about a month ago and it was fine. The only issue I had was the housekeeper flipped the latch on my door when she cleaned it one day and never flipped it back. When I arrived to my room that night It was a little scary to see. Nothing was missing but the desk clerk didn't seem to care to much.

I stayed again this past weekend on a my way to California. The stay was fine, room was okay but again the cutsomer service was shocking. I got a call to my room in the morning that my car was broken in to. (4 others as well). I went outside to assess the damages. Nothing major was stolen my window was shattered but all and all not the worst thing that can happen. That's life I guess. What upset me was the lack of sympathy the managment had on the people that were broken into. No real apology, no compensation for our troubles, no real interest. I would think maybe a list of places that could get a window fix, maybe our night taken care of since our cars got broken into in your hotel parking lot, SOMETHING. But nothing, except a response "that's why we have signs in our parking lot." Signs say "not responsible for damage caused to your vehicle."

Again the stay(s) weren't the issue but the service will be the reason I will not stay here again. Maybe this happens all the time and that's why they didn't seem to care.</p><br>Could never stay here again<p>The staff was great. They were the only good thing I can say about this location. The room I had on the 3rd floor has the worst carpet of any room I have ever stayed in anywhere. They may try to clean it but it doesn't show. It looks dirty, and very worn. My sliding shower door cam off the first morning after I showered. Hair all over the bathroom floor from previous visitors. Breakfast was mediocre. Could not stay here again because it wasn't clean. I travel to Las Vegas 8 times a year for work. This is the 3rd Hampton inn I have tried in the vegas valley, and easily the worst..
Room Tip: Avoid thus place
See more room tips</p><br>A great stay<p>I was in a 100 Mile bike ride that weekend and this was a perfect location. The staff went out of their way to accommodate my late checkout request so I could have a shower after my event. The breakfast was great pre-ride fuelling and the complimentary coffee in the lobby was a real nice touch.</p><br>What a dump!<p>The carpet in room 318 hasn't been replaced in eons. I expected more from a Hilton associated property. No hot tub, the pool was filthy, the breakfast staff was overwhelmed on Saturday morning due to the soccer groups (which the management knew about) and not a manager in sight on a busy weekend</p><br>Stole my goods<p>Everything was fine until the last day, when my $150 bottle of perfume was stolen. Annoyed that the front desk didn't do anything to help. They said we will look into it, but didn't follow up with anything. Hotel was clean and near suburbs, not near the strip.</p><br>Comfortable place - great beds<p>Room was very nice and clean. The beds were comfortable. I am a restless sleeper but I had not problem going to sleep and staying asleep all night. Breakfast was nice, a wide variety of breakfast items.</p><br>Great place to stay<p>Hampton more than any other chain I go to treats its guests as royalty, especially their HHonors members. Front desk personnel very nice, room great, internet fast. A quick 10 minutes from the airport and saved $60 from cheapest airport hotel.</p><br>Irritable Staff and Higher than Worth Price<p>This hotel was clean and well kept. However, if you are looking for friendly staff that is willing to help solve issues or provide customer satisfaction, you are better off looking at other places. The cost was higher than hotels on the strip and possessed less comfortable amenities such as lighting and the bed itself. I would rather stay on the strip for less money and more comfort than away from the mainstream for higher price and unfriendly staff.</p><br></body></html>
