We arrived after 10:00 p.m after a flight into Las Vegas. The lobby was quiet and our check-in was very fast. The room was nice, well-appointed and clean. The hallways were quiet. The breakfast was what you would expect at a Hampton Inn, which is good. If we had more time and sunnier weather, we would have used their outdoor pool in the morning because it looked pretty nice.

The hotel is in a very nice area with many dining and shopping options very close by.
Room Tip: We were on the fourth floor facing Grand Canyon Drive. We couldn't hear any noise coming from o...

The hotel is very close to the 215 so its easy on easy off. You are about 20 minutes from the strip so keep that in mind. Area around it is nice and not shady or dirty. Construction is basically done, just looks like punch list stuff left. We stayed in a double queen room. The only thing I, and my family, thought was missing was a mini fridge. It would have been nice if the room had one, for say you get subway for the next days activities so you are up and running first thing in the morning. The breakfast was good although the OJ tasted strange. All in all a good stay. Thanks

When travelling, I like to "recharge" my blue ice for our small Igloo cooler that we store drinks in. No such luck this time. So, I had to load it up with regular ice from their ice maker. Also, this place is still being remodeled (this was supposed to be done by the end of September). Despite being "remodeled", one of the shower doors was stuck in place. Also, my wife thought the quality of the towels was the worst we've ever had at a Hampton's Inn. I seriously doubt that we'd be staying here again. On the plus side, the person attending the breakfast did a great job. The food was sufficiently stocked and the breakfast area was spotless.</p><br>Good Stay<p>Stayed 4 nights. Remodeling still going on but noise was not a problem. Room was spacious and well set up. Bed and couch were very comfortable. Room was quiet, hallway noise was minimal, however some noises from room above were heard.</p><br>Way away from the strip but in a beautiful area of Vegas<p>This hotel is still going through renovations. However, the room we stayed in was all done with a modern bathroom. Beds were comfy with down pillows. Breakfast had waffles, hot oatmeal, eggs, sausage, cereals, fruits, coffee, tea, bread,bagels ---which was more than I expected. Surrounding area full of restaurants and stores. If you are looking to be near the strip, this is not walking distance. You would need to have a car.
Room Tip: Stay away from rooms close to the elevators

Engineer Alex arrived shortly. A/C wouldn't work for him. I expected move to next room. Nope, we got upgraded! Alex even helped us carry our luggage. Would come back.</p><br>Better bring a hard hat<p>This hotel is under major renovations and is currently a wreck! Everything is torn apart and they actually have hazard tape throught the lobby. All advertised amenities are not even available. Have no idea when renovations will be complete.</p><br>Great hotel!<p>Great staff! Even with remodeling going on everything was in order and breakfast are great! Nice to stay away from the strip for a more normal travel experience. Excellent access to the 215 and Red Rock Canyon. Several eateries close as well.</p><br>Las Vegas NOT ON THE STRIP<p>location location, location. Great place to stay, with many restaurants near and the Las Vegas Athletic club just next door. Easy access to the interstate and if you have time, all that Summerlin has to offer. Will definitely return.</p><br>Relaxing visit<p>My husband and I enjoyed staying here. We had the pool to ourselves two mornings in a row. It was fairly quiet and the staff was very helpful! The breakfast selection was good. I would have liked more of a fruit option. I like that this location was far enough out from the strip, but close enough that you could get there easily.</p><br></body></html>
