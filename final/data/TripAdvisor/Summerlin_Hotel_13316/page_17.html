<html><head><h3>Hampton Inn & Suites Las Vegas-Red Rock/Summerlin Hotel Reviews Page 17</h3></head><body><br>Hotel Stay<p>Rooms were nice and clean, had a good refrigerator, but no microwave, but the one in the microwave was available to use. Continental breakfast had a variety of foods and was good. The workout facility had 2 treadmills an elliptical and bike with some weights. Equipment was older but worked fine.</p><br>Very impressed<p>Every member of the staff was extremely friendly, the hotel is very clean and the room was clean, fresh, and very quiet. Highly recommend this hotel for business travelers or families visiting the Las Vegas area.</p><br>never disappointed with Hampton<p>Great for family. always loves Hampton breakfast and friendly stuffs. This one is no exception. The stuff called us in our room to make sure everything is all right. Great personal touch. However, no hot coca available that disappointed my kids ( They so used to hot coca from every Hampton Inn in the past ). Also our room did not get serviced in the second day of our 4 days stay</p><br>So far so good<p>Stayed at several hamptons...this one is up there in terms of quality. Good location, decent breakfast and the staff was great to work with. The work out facility room is substandard but its likely due to the size of the room.</p><br>Too expensive for what you get<p>The breakfast is not great, the beds are firm, and the fitness room is very tiny. No fridge or microwave unless you upgrade to the King Suite. I thought $129/night was too much for a hotel of this quality. I am going back to Vegas next week, but staying at The Trump Tower for LESS!!</p><br>Comfort off the Strip<p>We were overjoyed to find a reasonably-priced hotel last minute that was far off The Strip. We were offered a good AAA rate, and off course, the expected clean and comfortable room and complimentary breakfast, as well as the other amenities that come with Hampton Inn. The location was easy to get in and out off (just off 215) and close to Red Rocks on the west side of town. Service was very good and it was very quiet here. One of the nicer Hamptons I have stayed in.</p><br>Dried urine on toilet seat and bowl rim... come on!<p>This hotel is a little dated and in need of a update. Luckily while I was there I saw some design/architect folks with plans consulting with Mgt in the lobby. My bathroom smelled like swamp gas. Pretty disgusting. THe toilet seat had some dried urine dribbles on it and on the toilet bowl rim. Really?? Come on!! Rest of the room was clean. Hotel was quiet. Front desk staff were great.</p><br>Get me the ___ out of here!<p>Hotel was filthy - carpets, seating areas. Moved my breakfast 3 times before I found an area I felt comfortable sitting. Shower head fell apart, shower door off track, nauseating smell of sewer when we returned to our room after seeing show in Las Vegas. Not consistent with Hilton property standards!!!</p><br>Will definitely return<p>Stayed here on 3 occassions and each time we are not disappointed. The staff, room, complimentary breakfast are great. If you don't like all the smoke and buzz on the strip, this hotel is conveniently located far enough away to feel like you're not in Vegas, but close enough to get the Strip when you want to gamble and enjoy the shows. We will definitely return.</p><br>House of horrors!<p>I traveled on business to Vegas and didn't want to stay on the Strip so I choose this Hampton...big mistake! The grounds were littered with trash and the rooms were dirty with stained carpet and stained duvet covers. The staff was rude and seemed indifferent to the guests. The hotel had a strange odor that wouldn't go away and it just appeared uncared for. I wanted to speak to the manager to complain however I was told by the desk clerk that "she" wouldn't do anything about it anyway. I left a message on the managers voicemail, but I never received a call back. I guess the desk clerk was right.
The rate was rather high for the horrible accommodations. I don't know how this hotel can be a Hilton property. Very disappointing.</p><br></body></html>
