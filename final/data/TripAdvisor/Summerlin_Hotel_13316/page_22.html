Clean, super helpful staff, the usual VERY CLEAN rooms and bedding and the location is close to everything you might need. Onsite laundry for folks who go there for sports tournaments and need to wash uniforms etc... All Great! The staff is friendly and helpful, the rooms can be as cool as you want (and you truly control it) and the beds are the most comfortable I've found. The Hampton Inns have the bedding stuff figured out. I'd only rate the Fairmont and a boutique hotel in the Caymans as being better, which the price differential is a Huge indicator. Visit this hotel with confidence.</p><br>Nice clean hotel!<p>Was here on business trip for only 1 night but lived up to all expectations. Room was clean, free internet, friendly staff, walking distance to nearby restaurants and bars, had a pool, free breakfast...what else could you ask for??</p><br>Sweet Hotel<p>My son and I stayed at this hotel in early July 2013. The weather was VERY HOT when we were there and coming back to our room was a real treat! One of the amenities was a free breakfast, which seems to be hard to find in Las Vegas. The breakfast had an assortment of waffles, eggs/sausage, cereal [hot and cold], fruit, muffins/rolls, coffee and juice. Two of the mornings we were there the place was packed and it was hard for the staff to keep up. However, they made a good effort in getting the food areas filled.

Our room was nice and clean and everything was fresh. The only thing I can say, and it is not really a complaint, but an observation. Perhaps you should have someone NOT 6 feet tall as a measure to how high the bathroom counter is made. I am 5' 2" and I felt like a kid next to the counter. Nice counter but WAY TOO SHORT for those of us under 5' 4". As there were a lot of children at this hotel, I wonder how they did with the height.

The location is nice and near stores/restaurants and not too far is the Red Rock Canyon which is a must see!

All in all I would stay here again. The staff is friendly and one gentleman even took a photo of my son and I when we checked out. Check it out!
Room Tip: We were on the 4th floor and had no problems with noise outside or inside. AC was fine.

We booked a room because we needed to be in Las Vegas to meet some other family members before starting a week long vacation. The hotel is in a great area (shopping wise) and 15 minutes from the airport. Above average free breakfast, but still with fake eggs!</p><br>family reunion stay<p>Our family was disappointed with the Hampton Inn even though one problem was fixed the others did not seem to matter. I also heard other folks at the desk complaining about their problems Just expected a better experience My son in law who had their door left open by housekeeping stays in many different hotels, and said he will never stay at a Hampton inn again</p><br>Average<p>Bath tub was dirty when checked in - had dirt in it. Did not get my wake up call which made us a little late then to top it off, our breakfast bags were not ready and that put us another 15 minutes behind. Management did not live up to the 100% satisfaction. Very disappointed.</p><br>Very convenient hotel for Las Vegas<p>In general the service was very good, I would recommend this hotel to people who want to enjoy Vegas and being away from the craziness of the Strip. Prices are affordable and the staff are very helpful. The hotel is clean and safe. However, there are few things that need to be addressed:
1- When we are driving at the South Grand Canyon st, the sign for the hotel is too small for the first time visitor to notice it. There should be a bigger sign with the name of the hotel placed at the current location at that street.
2- Internet was slow, unbelievably slow on Saturday and Sunday, when I complained to staff, they said because the hotel is full there is high demand on the router!! I never had this kind of problem in bigger hotels. This is a problem that should be fixed by the management.
3- I had a problem in the door lock of my room, apparently something was messed up in the electronics of the lock, however I was lucky to have the technician come and fix it within 15 minutes after I was locked outside my room. Maybe it is time to do a check up on the locks.

With the exception of the above, I had a pleasant stay at the hotel.
Room Tip: If you want to enjoy mountain views ask for a room looking West, if you want your room to be facing...

They are quick to help everyone and yet find a second to say hello to passing guests. They try to accommodate all your needs and I find that they are very caring. Kitchen help needs work, and the food is your normal mediocre hotel stuff.</p><br>A great value<p>My stay at this Hampton Inn was as good as it could be. The room was clean and comfortable, the staff was helpful and professional, and the breakfast had a nice variety of choices with good coffee. My room was quiet and comfortable with good air conditioning.</p><br>Could be much better if they cleaned up the place...dirty carpets and litter.<p>This is your average Hampton Inn with a lot of wear and tear. The carpet in our room was very dirty and the exterior areas had lots of trash. Service is good and great location. Would be much better if they took better care of the place.</p><br></body></html>
