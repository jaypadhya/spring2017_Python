<html><head><h3>Hampton Inn & Suites Las Vegas-Red Rock/Summerlin Hotel Reviews Page 21</h3></head><body><br>Great Hotel<p>I've stayed the this Hampton Inn a few times in the past and it's always been great! I've also recommended this hotel to friends who liked it and would go back. If you want a nice place to stay in Vegas, this is it.</p><br>A Great Hotel Experience<p>Inviting and helpful staff, professional attitude from the front desk to the cleaning staff. They made me feel welcome and important. A very clean hotel, neatly kept, with obvious care. I recommend anyone stay at a Hampton Inn and Suites.</p><br>Good place to stay and decent price.<p>Super nice people. Super clean. The furniture and carpet are a bit old, but I've seen worse. I actually ended up staying there again and the front desk guy remembered me. The people there rock. Plus, there's a ton of places around to explore.</p><br>The room was not up to Hampton standerd<p>The staff were very friendly and helpful. The Carpet was either dirty or stained. The chairs in the room were on the desk not on the floor. The air conditioner was so loud we chose not to use it. Not up to Hampton standards.</p><br>Vegas Hampton<p>The hotel facilities, staff, value for the money and location are excellent. The staff remembers me and remembers my needs. There is easy to all major roads and highways, shopping and eating. The facilities meet most people needs.</p><br>Vegas Stay<p>The hotel is very clean, comfortable, and secure. I do not like staying on the Vegas strip when there for business. Great location for food and drink, health club, moderately priced. I used my AAA for a discount, and got HHonors points too!</p><br>Love coming back here<p>This hotel is perfect for our groups competing at Red Rock - quiet and away from the busy casinos - the complimentary breakfast is an awesome bonus! The staff accommodate our group really well - considering we are a group and most hotels hate dealing with groups!</p><br>Really like the Red Rock Hampton Inn in Las Vegas<p>We have stayed at the Red Rock Hampton Inn for the past several years when we visit Las Vegas. We have found the service to be excellent, the rooms nicely appointed and the free breakfasts very good quality. Also, there are a couple of very good restaurants close by, not more than a quarter mile. The location is very helpful, with quick access to the 215 beltway, which will get us a good route to any part of the Las Vegas Valley.</p><br>Big Bang for your Buck<p>Cannot say enough about this place. Excellent services, cleanliness and value. Quiet location but close to all amenities, natural attractions such as Red Rock Canyon and quick 15 minute trip to the Strip. Appreciated the building being entirely non-smoking. Great breakfast buffet. Very professional staff. It felt so good being there that we hated to leave!</p><br>Hamptom suites redrock summerlin<p>Good clean quality establishment. Staff are very helpfull and professional. quite a disstance from downtown and the stip so have transportation or the cab fair will be very expenisive. nearby shopping and dining. nearby fitness center in walking distance the hotel offers a 15$ pass to. this is very resonable when health club passes can run between 20 to 100$ per day.</p><br></body></html>
