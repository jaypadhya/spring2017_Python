So I cahnged rooms, the scond room was 60 degrees and it took the HVAC system 3 hours to get the room up to 72 degrees. The fitness center equipment is not maintained and the treadmills are a hazard. The belts catch and could cause you to be thrown and seriously injured. Also most of the TV equipment is broken and not maintained. If you want a better place to stay in the area, try The Element hotel - nice quality rooms, better breakfast, great fitness center. I stay at this Hampton at least once a month but will be changing to the Element which is a shame because I am a Hilton Honors member.</p><br>High traffic problem solver<p>This hotel is a few miles from the strip but when there is a big convention at the LVCC or when you have to save a few dollars it is a good place to rest your weary bones. Breakfast is very good for a little buffet and I'm hooked on the waffles. The property is right off of the 215 bypass and very easy to get to. Right next to a shopping center. To get to the strip you just drive East on Flamingo and park at one of the hotels. Most have free self-park lots. If you are really adventureous you can take the bus that stops at the shopping center.

Good value and clean, safe, tech connected.</p><br>Everything was great!<p>We had a group staying here to participate in a relay race in the area. When my two friends and I arrived, we realized that the group had booked 5 of us to one room. Not wanting to put this many people in one room, we went down to the front desk to see if they had any other rooms. The guy at the desk was very friendly and joked around with us. We were able to book a suite, which was really nice, at a very reasonable price. There is a small store area near the front desk where you can buy snacks, water, soda, etc. The free breakfast in the morning was really good and just what we needed before a 36 hour relay race. I would highly recommend this hotel if you are in this area. The view of the mountains is awesome too!</p><br>Not up to standards<p>My wife stayed here over the weekend because we were in town for some family business. This Hampton Inn was close to our events. We like to stay at Hampton Inn because their beds are always REALLY COMFY. This location was no different, I slept GREAT.

Now for the bad. First of all the website is set-up so that your reservation is easily hijacked by some cut-rate reservation service. Other people have commented on that, I won't repeat their compliants. Cancellations are NOT allowed.

Secondly, the breakfast this location provided was one of the worst hotel breakfasts I've ever encountered. I know that "complimentary breakfast" isn't going to compete with any restaurant but this was just plain awful. We had seven family members in three rooms and it was a unanimous vote to skip this breakfast even though it was "free".</p><br>Great Hotel, Staff &amp; Away From The Madness<p>The Hampton Inn & Suites Redrock/Summerlin is a wonderful choice away from the madness of the Las Vegas Strip or Downtown! You have a chance to feel a little more like a local as the Strip and Downtown are still easily accessible. The staff is amongst the best around, and the overall property is clean, the rooms are good size, and it is nice not to deal with a casino downstairs! There are plenty of opportunities for gambling for those who want to partake. The breakfast buffet was good, and is something as a traveler I really appreciate. It is a simple way to start the day and let's you explore other eating options for lunch and dinner!
Room Tip: One tip for all hotels is not to get one next to the elevators or ice machine.

We loved driving up to Red Rock Canyon every morning to walk and drink coffee, very near to hotel. The staff and room were excellent, no problems or issues.</p><br>Solid hotel<p>I recently stayed in this hotel for a weekend. I thought it was a very solid and pleasant hotel.

The staff is extremely friendly and hard working. While not gourmet, breakfast was perfectly acceptable. The room was pleasant and clean. The lobby provides a good area for meeting and hanging out. The hotel is well located - relatively easy to get to many places all over the city.

The only problem I had was with the computers. They were barely functional.They were so slow I believe that they were being powered by rodents on a wheel. It took more than ten minutes to print out a boarding pass.</p><br>dirty and in need of renovation<p>By far, the dirtiest and most run down Hampton we've ever stayed in. For $80 a night we could have stayed on the strip in a much nicer place! As a Hilton Honors member, we try to always stay with the brand and expect a certain level of comfort and service. The bed was clean and the bathroom was clean but everything else was in very poor condition.There were marks and dirt all over the walls, the carpet was dirty and worn. The furniture was all banged up. The lobby and lobby restroom had dirt on the carpet and floors and paper towels littering the floor. The front desk personnel were indifferent at best. I could go on but you get the picture!
There are 2 restaurants within walking distance of this hotel: Dave's BBQ and a Mexican restaurant. The BBQ place is outstanding We did not try the Mexican restaurant..
Room Tip: Not up to Hampton standards
See more room tips</p><br>Typical Clean Hampton; showing some age<p>Hampton Inns are generally extremely clean, well managed and do what they are designed to do: provide a good night's sleep in a reasonably safe and clean environment. Red Rock/Summerlin does exactly that, with a morning breakfast also. This particular Hampton is showing some age but the staff is still wonderful.
Room Tip: East side rooms avoid afternoon summer sun, wake up with sunrise AND have a (distant) view of the La...
See more room tips</p><br>Outstanding service<p>We booked for one night as we expected to fly back to the UK the next day. Unfortunately my husband became very ill and was admitted to hospital. I stayed at the hotel for 5 nights. The management and all of the staff were so supportive during this stressful time. I can't thank them enough. I hope we can return one day so that my husband can say thank you in person.</p><br></body></html>
