<html><head><h3>Hampton Inn & Suites Las Vegas-Red Rock/Summerlin Hotel Reviews Page 23</h3></head><body><br>Excellent Hotel with Reasonable Rates<p>Warm and friendly staff, very clean, comfortable beds, internet in rooms, pool, gym, and a full breakfast with great room rates. Negative - not a big selection of TV channels and movies very expensive ($16)!</p><br>Great service but the place needs to be taken care of better.<p>I was looking for a place in Summerlin. This had a great rate and was close to a lot of things.
It was a little challenging to get to. Maybe I was not paying attention but I kept going down the wrong street. Even with GPS, I did not get to the entrance the first time.
The landscaping definitely needs attention. Looks like the scrubs are not being taken care of and just overall lack of attention.
My room looks like someone had spot painted the walls instead of repainting the entire wall. All in all, I think it needs some updating.
The lady at the front desk was very nice.
Room Tip: Kind of weird to find.
See more room tips</p><br>Decent but showing wear<p>There are not many non-casino hotels in SW Vegas/ Summerlin, so its good to find this one. A decent property with comfortable features, but it shows a high level of wear and tear for only being 5 years old. Its good for traveling, but if you are looking for a backdrop for a lasting memory (like a wedding) then be aware that this hotel is slightly scruffy, but still gets the job done.</p><br>Quiet in Vegas<p>A nice place to stay off the Strip but easily accessible nonetheless. Beautiful area, lots of shopping and freeway accessible. The staff is friendly and helpful. I had difficulty with billing although I paid in advance to secure a better hotel rate, and although my bill balance was 0.00 when it was placed under the door, I was still asked to leave my credit card information, "just in case". Terrible and racist.</p><br>Great location off the strip<p>Great staff, above average complimentary breakfast in the morning. Had a couple of minor issues with our rooms and the staff took care of it immediately. If you are looking to stay off the strip, would recommend this place.</p><br>Great Value and easy location<p>Nice value for the money. Hotel Staff is great, easy location by the fitness center and off of 215. Clean rooms and feel safe in this location. I originally showed up at the wrong location but the starff took care of me so I could stay at this location.</p><br>Clean, comfortable with a good location<p>Good stay for the business traveler seeking a NW location. Decent sized room, polite staff and above all, very clean. The breakfast is typical for Hamptons and Faifields - fresh with a good selection. The property is about eight miles (25 minutes) from The Strip. I found the beds to be a little too soft for my liking - prefer a good firm mattress but other than that, an OK place to stay. I will be returning again in two weeks.</p><br>Great Alternative to Gaming Hotels in Las Vegas<p>The hotel is a short drive from the Las Vegas Strip, but is a GREAT alternative to all of the gaming hotels. It is a non-smoking facility. Yeah!! We were very comfortable here and enjoyed not having to deal with the hustle and the bustle of the Las Vegas Strip.</p><br>Great quality for the price.<p>I would recommend this Hampton Inn and look forward to stays at other Hampton Inns. Prior to this trip, I was unaware that Hampton was owned by Hilton. I do use and like the Hilton Honors program and will continue to use their services. It was a very enjoyable experience.</p><br>Wow! Customer Service At Its Best!<p>Sunni (sp?) was EXTREMELY helpful both with my reservation process AND during check in. During the reservation, there was an issue with getting one of the rooms for Fri & Sat. I explained over the phone what I needed and she took care of it. Then when we arrived, she remembered me and helped with getting us checked in. After the reservations were made, I found where the prices were not what I expected. I do not remember the gentlemens name who helped me the next morning, but I explained my question and he took care of me; promptly! I do several BBQ contests in the Vegas area and I will DEFINATELY be back to this property!</p><br></body></html>
