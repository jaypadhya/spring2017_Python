<html><head><h3>Hampton Inn & Suites Las Vegas-Red Rock/Summerlin Hotel Reviews Page 14</h3></head><body><br>The staff is great<p>Our team was in Las Vegas for a softball tournament. We stayed at this hotel - the accommodations were very good and the staff was great. Breakfast was good & the rooms were clean/nice. Next year we will probably stay here again. Thank you for all you did!</p><br>good value<p>Great location in the suburb of downtown Vegas. Very clean. Non-smoking hotel, which is great and someone down the hall was actually getting kicked out for smoking in their room. Thankfully! Great breakfast area and Starbucks and many other restaurants within walking distance. Have stayed here twice now.</p><br>Nothing Spectacular<p>This hotel had its good points and bad points. The breakfast and internet were fine. The pool was dirty and I found leftover items in the room from the prior guests. Good location, plenty of places to eat nearby, some within walking distance.</p><br>Pleaseant and Economical!<p>Clean room, comfortable bed, complimentary coffee and tea bar along with complimentary breakfast makes this a great choice. It is also within walking distance of some great restaurants! I would stay here again and highly recommend staying here.</p><br>Good place<p>The hotel is affordable and does the job: it provides good amenities and the service is good as well. It also provided free wireless and a complimentary breakfast that is decent (eggs, meat, juices, pastries...).</p><br>Pick another Hampton /hotel<p>I would not stay at this Hampton Inn again. The carpets in the room were very dirty. LOW END on the towels and bedding. The air conditioning wall mounted system was loud even on low. Accessing it was challenging at first as signage was poor. But the location for my purpose was good. But again, NOT AGAIN. I'd pay more someplace with clean carpets, nicer amenities, and central air.</p><br>Typical Hampton Inn, nice staff, breakfast area smallish<p>Very satisfied with this hotel, exactly what we've come to expect from the Hampton Inn brand. Clean, good beds, friendly staff. Only (slightly) negative remark would be the rather small breakfat area and limited breakfast options (it was however probably exceptionally busy due to the memorial weekend)</p><br>True to Hampton/Hilton standards<p>Convenient and comfortable place to stay if you want to be near Red Rock area. Tons of shopping and restaurants close by and located just off 215 beltway. Rented a studio suite for much needed fridge/microwave. Typical Hampton comfy beds, smaller than normal suite (but so is the hotel). Nice staff, good hot breakfast.
Room Tip: Upper floor has view of the strip (east) or Red Rocks (west)

I was really impressed with the grab bag breakfast idea though we chose not to use it this time. The beads were high quality for this price room.</p><br>Good Service<p>The stay went really well, it was great to stay at a property away from the strip. Jeromy, who was on Night Audit while I was there did a fantasic job. The service really went out of their way to make us enjoy our stay. We did have some engineering issues, including the shower head falling off and this piece of wood that fell off of the desk (which my 16 month old daughter found and nearly pricked her finger. Jeromy went ahead and gave me the 100% and engineering came up and fixed it the next day. The pool was nice and warm and the breakfast was good, but the service will bring us back. My daughter did get a little scared of the right elevator, as the loud beeps frightened her. Although the floors and rooms need a remodel (and the HVAC units were loud!!), if you're looking for great service, this property was top notch.</p><br></body></html>
