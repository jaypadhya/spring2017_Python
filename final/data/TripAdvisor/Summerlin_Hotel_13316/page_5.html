<html><head><h3>Hampton Inn & Suites Las Vegas-Red Rock/Summerlin Hotel Reviews Page 5</h3></head><body><br>Worst Hilton property ever.<p>My room was not cleaned properly. There was hair under the sink and in the shower. The AC would not turn off and kicked cold air all night. The walls and fixtures were in need of a good scrubbing. The walls in the hallways also needed to be washed. The furniture in the room was outdated, and the curtains needed to be cleaned.

The staff was worst than the rooms! First desk clerk had patrons in line while she gave out nutrition consultations, and wanted to verbally attack me when I called with an issue.

The general manager did not even give me the courtesy to return my call, but simply blew me an email. WOW. . I thought Hilton/ Hampton brand spoke of excellence? Not this time... I would never recommend this propety to my worst enemy.

Just horrible!</p><br>Nice to be off strip<p>Hotel was very nice. Clean, conveniently located, nicely furnished, sufficient amenities. The complimentary breakfast, while not gourmet, was handy and sufficient to get us out the door, and the coffee is always available, complete with flavored creamer (made MY day!). Hampton's never disappoint - this location was no exception.</p><br>Business Trip to Summerlin<p>This Hotel needs to step up, furniture is outdated and rooms are not cleaned properly. Carpet is dirty and stained Have your cleaning staff retrained Staff is nice and good service. The rates are not bad.</p><br>Good value away fro LV Strip<p>I've stayed at the Hampton Inn Red Rock a number of times. The rooms are always clean and comfortable. The staff has been friendly and helpful with restaurant recommendations. Breakfast is acceptable, but not great. Usually get a free room upgrade. I'll be back in June for work again.</p><br>SUPERB HOTEL AND A GREAT RATE!<p>Every time I come to Las Vegas, for business or relaxation, I stay at the Hampton Inn and Suites. It has absolutely everything I need including internet, swimming pool, small gymnasium and complimentary breakfast. Great value for money.</p><br>Inexpensive but shabby<p>Rooms are clean and staff is helpful, but this Hampton is a heavily worn version of the usually reliable chain. Rugs, furniture, and walls are all are in bad shape. My room required maintenance which should have be detected before I arrived and the business center computers did not work. Did not have breakfast, but it looked good. Local traffic around the hotel was very busy due to a heavily used fitness club next door. About 30 minutes from the strip and airport. Nice view of sunrise over the strip if you are up early.</p><br>Most pleasant hotel experience<p>Incredibly kind, patient, and helpful staff. Very clean room. Quiet and comfortable. Great water pressure in the shower. There is not one thing I can say anything negative about. Wonderful from check in to check out :)</p><br>Great Location away from the Strip.<p>If you are looking for good, quiet and clean accommodations off the strip, then this is the place for you. The staff was friendly and organized. The beds were comfortable and the breakfast was great as well. Great for families who want to be away from the Vegas action. Good experience.</p><br>Looking Very Worn<p>I had stayed here before when it was newer and it was quite nice. But, it has not been maintained and everything from the spilled drinks in the elevator (not cleaned up all day) to the worn and dingy carpets were a turn-off.
Room Tip: The side facing the gym parking lot can be noisy into the night.

Great breakfast! Comfortable bed. Extremely quiet! Great customer service. Cant say enough about the breakfast.</p><br></body></html>
