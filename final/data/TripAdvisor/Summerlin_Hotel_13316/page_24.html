<html><head><h3>Hampton Inn & Suites Las Vegas-Red Rock/Summerlin Hotel Reviews Page 24</h3></head><body><br>Happy Traveler<p>My experiences with Hampton Inn's have always been positive. It doesn't matter where I go, their facilities are clean, associates are nice and informative, and the price is good. Thank you for making my nights away from home enjoyable.</p><br>Had a wonderful stay with my family at this hotel. All staff were very well trained or were very well helpful.<p>Even-though we stayed there for sleeping, showering and breakfast, there were many other amenities available that we did not use like exercise facility and the business center. We stayed there for five days returning from a trip to Los Angeles, before staying at Mega Hotel on the Las Vegas Boulevard which service was not even close to this hotel. The hotel is located in a very new developed area on the outskirt of town however easily accessible by only a 10-15 minute drive. In addition, as a foreign visitor best and safest shopping experience around the area from a few minutes of driving. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to stay for leisure or attend for business purposes.</p><br>Quiet place to stay in Vegas if you don't like to stay on the strip.<p>I really enjoy staying at Hampton Inns when I travel. Vegas is not my kind of town but it is a convenient stopping place on my way to or from LA or Phoenix. this is perfect if you want to stay off the strip. Very quiet and nice staff.</p><br>Very good, not great.<p>Good location right off Hwy 215. Lots of Dining options within walking distance. Room was clean and well furnished. Good exercize room, good laundry room, nice lobby. Complimentary breakfast was below average for a Hampton Inn. No mini-fridge in the room.</p><br>Dirty Hotel<p>I'm astonished that this property is a Hilton property. I'm a Hilton Honors member that travels a lot for business and I try to stay at a Hilton because I know that I can (typically) expect a good nights stay, a clean hotel, and friendly staff. That was not the case with this hotel. I had reservations for three nights, but the hotel was so bad that I checked out after the first night and went to a different hotel. Every wall in the room had marks on it, the carpet was dirty, the furniture was so beat up it looked like used furniture, the parking lot looked like the scene after a frat party, and the staff was unattentive. The morning I checked out, the person working the front desk was sitting in the breakfast seating area playing on his phone and talking to the breakfast server, who was also sitting at the table.
I would NEVER stay at this location ever again and would not recommend it to anyone.</p><br>Great stay, will come back!<p>Our family traveled and stayed at this hotel. It was great! The extremely clean room and hotel was refreshing! The hotel staff was wonderfully cheerful, helpful, and quick for check in and check out procedures. My kids just loved the breakfast choices in the morning. Us too! My husband loved the coffee cart for his early mornings, and the kids even went down with him for the hot chocolate! Our only dissatisfaction was the lack of appropriate channels for children on the t.v. They had the nickelodeon channel, but for our 5 and 7 yr. old, it had inappropriate shows on for their age. A disney or cartoon channel would of been nice. But our time in front of the tube was small anyways. Other than that, we would definitely come back, and absolutely recommend this place to everyone!!! Oh, by the way, when we checked out, and didnt have time for a hot breakfast, they had to-go bags for us all filled with water, a muffin, a fruit, cereal bar and mints! How thoughtful was that!</p><br>Downhill Slide<p>First impressions: trash on the perimeter parking area, smokers hovering near front entrance, stale odor in lobby. An accommodating, friendly staff member greeted us inside the empty lobby with a quick check-in. We were told the on-site fitness center was out-of-order. Our first trip up to our assigned room was not good. We arrived to a stinky room without bedding. Our second room was better but still lacking in freshness. The usual complimentary breakfast was available, but, again, we sensed a lack of freshness. The price was probably right but we probably won't return here.</p><br>Great for Visiting Teams<p>I would give this hotel high marks for customer service. We have stayed here in the past for the same tournament and have always had a very nice visit. The hotel staff was very accomodating and went out of their way to make sure we were well taken card of. The complimentary breakfast is a huge hit with my lacrosse team and saves the club money as well. The hotel is very tolerant of the girls and again, their customer service was outstanding. We will definitely be staying here at future visits to Las Vegas.</p><br>Nice but...<p>This is a nice property, located right off I-215 about 15 minutes west of the Strip. We got a king suite, which included a sofa bed, fridge and microwave. The room was spacious and even with the sofa bed pulled out we didn't feel like we were right on top of each other. The staff was nice and the breakfast was good.
It should be noted that the type of room we got has a room with the toilet and shower and the vanity is in the common area. It's hard for a person to get ready and allow others to sleep in this situation, and some people might not prefer this set up.
There is something that prevented this from being a 5 star stay and that is cleanliness. Our room itself was very clean, but there were stains on the couch. Every common area was dirty, with stains on the carpet and furniture. The elevators had debris in every corner and the carpets in the hallways were black. I don't think the hallways had even been vacuumed, as the same food debris (corn nuts) were on the floor in the hall both nights we stayed. Even outside there was an excess of garbage lining the property. I am sure this is a high traffic location and it might be hard to keep up with the volume of guests, but all of the common area looked like they could use a good deep cleaning.
Room Tip: Rooms on the east side have a view of the Strip.

I booked one of the king whirlpool rooms and it was worth the extra money. It had a large shower in addition to the whilrpool and the shower had three seperate water sources, including one of those overhead rainshower things. The room and lobby were very clean, but I did notice what others have pointed out. The walls in the hall are a little scuffed up and looks like people banged their luggage against the walls. I wouldn't, however, say that the hotel itself is dirty at all. Sunni and Francisco at the front desk were very helpful. I was rather indecisive on where to eat and they gave some good recommendations. I even chit-chatted with Sunni a bit later in the evening. The only negative was that the fire alarms went off late in the evening. That was disruptive, inconvenient to leave the hotel, but it wasn't the end of the world. At least I knew the alarm system was working! There were numerous food places around. Sunni recommended Sushi Tower and I thought it was delicious.</p><br></body></html>
