<html><head><h3>Hampton Inn & Suites Las Vegas-Red Rock/Summerlin Hotel Reviews Page 8</h3></head><body><br>Cleanliness<p>The rooms were clean and did not smell. service was excellent especially for the complimentary breakfast. she really kept the fresh food out and the place clean. The receptionist was polite and efficient and started calling us by name immediately.</p><br>Hotel Staff is Excellent<p>The hotel staff was so friendly and helpful, anticipating my needs and being genuinely kind to me. I'm so impressed with Hampton Hotel Staff, I'll definitely stay again. __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __</p><br>Stressful Stay<p>I was staying at this hotel with my grown son in two separate rooms while relocating to Las Vegas from northern Nevada. There was ample space to park my U-Haul truck and the accommodations were adequate but a bit shabby. Unfortunately, my room key stopped working when I returned to my room from breakfast. It took awhile to regain access to my room for check-out. Thus I was delayed in moving my suitcases and other stuff back to the car and truck. We were late getting to my new apartment to unload the U-Haul truck with paid unloaders who were waiting for us. Overall, a very stressful experience.
Room Tip: I am not sure what would help make a stay at this busy hotel more comfortable.

Staff was very attentive and very nice... just too bad the property itself was such a dump.</p><br>Nasty<p>Just too dirty.........breakfast below acceptable but people there are nice. Sausage smell wafting through out the building. Carpets are nasty, exercise room is below par. Stay elsewhere, I travel all the time and would avoid this place altogether.</p><br>In need of upgrades<p>The location is good with easy access to southwest Vegas locations. The breakfast attendants are super. Unfortunately that is the end of the good.

The hotel exterior has received the requisite fancy Hampton upgrade, but that hasn't translated to the interior. As a Hilton Diamond I spend many nights per year in Hampton Inns, and this one is in dire need of the interior upgrade program. Unfortunately there are no signs of this in process, such as the big shipping containers in the parking lot.

The hallway carpets are stained and tattered; the walls chipped and scarred. This continues into the rooms. My King Standard had numerous dark scuffs on the walls, the bathroom vanity water-stained and peeling, and the furniture was outdated, worn, and broken. A 70s-era dining room table was the desk, complete with shattered leg. See the pictures.

The small TV is basic cable at best, with fewer than 25 real channels. AMC? Nope. Comedy Central? No. Spike, FX, Food, Travel, Nick, Disney? Not here. And for some unknown reason, certain cable channels are not on Pacific feed, so for example Conan starts at 9:30p.

Also note that only certain rooms have a refrigerator and microwave.

The cramped exercise room has likewise escaped the latest Hampton upgrade cycle; during my visit one treadmill was non-functional, the elliptical was clanking loudly, and the minimalist weight machine missing several key components.

This hotel is in a rapidly growing area of Las Vegas, and if Hilton doesn't address the shortcomings at this property pretty quickly, Marriott and IHG are going to eat them alive. I know I won't be back until there's significant improvement. Certainly not up to the current Hampton Inn standards.</p><br>Always a Great Place to Stay<p>I have stayed at the Hampton Inn in many cities and each one of them are of excellent quality and service. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone. The rooms are always clean and the breakfast one of the best quality I've experienced.</p><br>Recent Stay<p>The room was fine and the staff was well trained and helpful. The room was quiet by the in room HVAC was loud and did not control the room temperature very well. It was in a convenient location as we were looking for a new home in the Las Vegas area.</p><br>Comfortable but in need of remodel and upgrades<p>This property does not live up to the Hilton or Hampton Inn standard. First, the good news, the beds are reasonably comfortable, the lobby is clean and well appointed and the location is excellent with close by access to numerous restaurants and shopping. However, customer service is lacking, rooms are not clean, TV is sporadic (remote did not work), and the bathroom is in dire need of repair and furniture upgrade. The shower head came apart when being adjusted and the door and furniture show obvious water damage.
Since I have family who have moved nearby I will stay at this property in a few months to see if it has improved. I hope it gets better.</p><br>Nasty<p>The hotel was dirty and in disrepair. The rooms were not clean and the linens dirty. The HVAC was malfunctioning. When I tried to turn the heat on it did not work the AC just continued to run at full effort. The bed was lumpy and just plain scary.</p><br></body></html>
