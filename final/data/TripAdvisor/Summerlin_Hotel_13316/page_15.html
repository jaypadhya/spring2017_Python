<html><head><h3>Hampton Inn & Suites Las Vegas-Red Rock/Summerlin Hotel Reviews Page 15</h3></head><body><br>Great Stay<p>The hotel was very clean. The staff was excellent. The pool was perfect...... Breakfast was very good and the food was hot. There was no issue with parking or security. There was one issue with someone smoking on our floor and the staff handled it right away. Did not have any other issues during our stay. Will stay here again.....</p><br>Find another hotel<p>Although most Hampton Inn's are clean and consistent, steet clear of this one. It is badly in need of renovation and the front desk staff was quite rude (we waitied for over ten minutes for her to get off the phone to check us in). In addition, she informed us upon check in that this stay would not count toward my Hilton Honors points because we had booked the hotel through Expedia -- HUH? That makes no sense. I get airline miles when I book through Expeida, why not hotel points. The room was dingy and dirty and the pool could use an update as well. You can find much better hotels in Vegas for the same price or less. Save your money and book elsewhere.</p><br>Clean rooms, poor cooling system<p>My mother was in a hospital that was situated near this hotel. The room was clean and not cramped but the AC unit rattled all night and the cover eventually fell off of it. There was no way to adjust the direction of the blower and the cold air would blow continuously on the bed. The high/low feature was not functional. Setting the temp at 80 would freeze you out and any setting higher caused the heat to come on. After talking with other guests it was clear that the cooling system didn't function well in other rooms. Not worth the time and bother to change rooms. Did not bother to complain to management as they already knew many of the rooms had this issue. The bed was comfortable.</p><br>Red Rock, Las Vegas Hampton Inn<p>Great location away from the strip, access to many nice restaurants and convenient stores. Easy access on and off I-215. Hotel staff went out of their way to be friendly, accommodating and asking he right questions at check in and check out. I'd definitely stay at this Hampton Inn again.</p><br>Best place to stay<p>From the moment we arrived until we drove away, this place was the best substitute for home. Easily the most comfortable bed we have slept on in the past YEAR! We are planning to buy a mattress like Hampton's for our home now. Friendly staff, clean rooms, excellent breakfasts, economic price.....we will be looking for Hampton Inns again as we travel in the future.</p><br>Clean<p>I checked into this hotel and was greeted by a friendly staff who allowed me to check in early. The rooms were clean and the location was perfect. I was also pleasantly surprised that they had free breakfast every morning with plenty of options.</p><br>Handicapped/Not<p>I am not Handicapped and respect those with any type of Challenge. I did not ask for a Handicapped Room, nor did I want one. I DID ask for another Room. I was told that was the only Room available. Hard to believe, I stay here occasionally because it is 8 miles from the LV Strip and I don't really go to there. Just passing through.</p><br>Really Great Hotel<p>Everything was so clean/fresh looking and smelling. I will definitely stay at a Hamton Inn & Suites again! A little off of the Vegas strip, but its nice to be away from the craziness and get a room that has higher standards than most casinos.</p><br>Las Vegas Birthday Party Visit<p>Nice Hotel with the exception of the digital cable TV service and the maid service on Saturday. The staff responded well to the two issues. Kevin Jackson in the breakfast room and Steve at the front desk were exemplanary employees and do a Great Job!</p><br>Overall - Mixed Bag<p>Staff was extremely friendly and prompt. You can't beat the free breakfast and the price of the room, it's a great value. The beds and pillows were really comfy, comparable to higher end hotels. It's off the 215 freeway and 10 min to Chinatown and 20 min to the Strip. However, the interiors are a little old and dated. The walls and carpets had stains.</p><br></body></html>
