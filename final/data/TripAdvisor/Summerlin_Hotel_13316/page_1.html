I like this place since it is not attached to a casino, it is fairly easy to get to (but hard to find if it is your first time there) and it is close to Red Rocks. It was awesome at first. This current trip I stayed when I got to Vegas, then went to Death Valley, then stayed when I got back. The arrival stay was bad. The room had a broken AC unit, so it was making this god-awful noise. I immediately called the front desk for another room or for them to fix it and the lady seem befuddled on what to do and said there were not any more rooms available. Luckily it was nice out so i left the thing off and kept the windows open. By the way, there are no thick curtains to block out the city lights. Again luckily I had Tylenol PM. Another disturbing thing was it appears the housekeeping do not clean underneath the toilet seat. I'll keep the details to that. The elevators were nasty, lots of trash. The food tasted mediocre, but the food area was clean and the food appeared to be prepared well. I had no major issues with the second stay, other than the pillows seem to be oddly plastic. They need to turn down the volume of their elevator bell. This place is right next to the Las Vegas Athletic Club, so expect testosterone in the parking area. Lots of little but loud cars driving fast.</p><br>Best Hampton inn in summerlin.<p>Good breakfast and great service. Best Hampton inn in summerlin. There are two of them in summerlin, Nevada. If you're heading to the Vegas strip, it's a straight flight down flamingo, which is located a couple blocks away.</p><br>A good Hampton<p>I picked this hotel because I was working in Vegas and didn't really want to stay on the strip. It met all of my expectations. The location is very convenient if you're working in the Red Rock area. The view is stunning if you're on the side of the hotel facing the mountains.</p><br>bored and discourteous staff<p>Place will be overrun by adolescent sports teams and their parents until March of 2016 (according to staff), and this will make your experience loud, uncomfortable and annoying. The parents got drunk on our visit and there was often no place to sit down and eat breakfast. the pool is miniscule and filthy. No refrigerator in our room - in LAS VEGAS!!! (plan on spending a lot for cold drinks)</p><br>Convenient to Red Rock Canyon<p>The overall amenities of this hotel were fine and the staff were friendly. We stayed here twice, one night each time. Our biggest issue was that none of us (2 adults, 2 teens) slept well during either visit. The hotel was quiet but we all tossed and turned all night. My best guess as to our sleeping issues were that the pillows were horrible and the comforter was too hot and bulky. There was not a regular blanket on the bed so the option was sheet only or use the hot, bulky comforter.</p><br>When in Vegas don't miss Red Rocks! <p>During your next trip to Los Vegas, do not miss the Red Rocks NATIONAL CONSERVATION AREA and STATE PARK! Take the 1/2 dozen mile trip out from the heart of town and discover this gem for yourself! The park and NCA is centered around a climate controlled main visitor center comprised of an interpretive center run by the BLM complete with 20 minute video presentation of the history and current offerings of the area. In another section there is a fantastic gift shop run by the Friends group of the National Conservation Area. It is extremely well stocked with the usual merchandise along with a great book, and monogrammed clothing section. Prices are about right without the usual gouging taken to access.
Centered around this complex is a 14 mile paved vehicle or bike route through the most scenic and geologically stunning areas. Contrary to the northern Sierras this area is comprised of sandstone- ancient sea floor- and in most cases uplifted at angles by fault activity, quite stunning. Add to this the intensely red dyed formations and you have a small idea what is in store for you.
The 14 mile loop is broken up by numerous turnouts, parking areas, and trail heads, which we used to great photographic advantage! The travel loop is well designed for families and older users and even ADA friendly. We were there at the beginning of October with daytime highs in the low century mark, so be prepared! A great trip can be had even in the protection of your air conditioned conveyance! We went during mid day when the abundance of critters was well hid, morning or later in the day would have been better, for wildlife viewing. Enjoy and have fun!</p><br>Great Quality - Good Price<p>We only stayed one night but it was great. The mattress was wonderful along with the pillows. I usually don't sleep well in hotels, but this one I did. They were in the process of remodeling. The only problem in our hotel room was that the desk was missing and the lamp was on the floor. Also the power to the TV had been disconnected, but they solved that problem very quickly. Would have taken care of the problem ourselves, but it required moving furniture to accomplish it.</p><br>Great hotel and staff, but unsafe<p>Very little concern for the safety of guests, this hotel has an ongoing theft and vandalism problem. Disappointing, because the staff was wonderful otherwise. Our car was broken into, our problem, understandably the hotel is not liable. However, hotel staff stated that it happened all the time, over the past seven years at least. Nothing is done to alleviate the problem or warn the guests. Contacting the hotel after the fact the manager was very cavalier about the issue. If a guest walks out on a theft in progress their safety could be at risk.</p><br>Start to finish was a great 3 night stay<p>From front desk to clean rooms and comfortable beds (nice breakfast as well) this was a nice stay. Staff friendly and helpful (even when we broke glass in the entry to our room). The free internet resets each day, but (if) that's the biggest complaint it was that nice of a place to stay for.</p><br>Awful pre-stay experience<p>I had an awful pre-trip experience for my recent stay: - My reservation was cancelled twice; the hotel allowed a third party to change/cancel my reservation without my permission - The hotel then tried to charge me $50/night more; I needed to speak to a third Rep to get the rate changed - In the process, the hotel booked me in a Queen handicapped room instead of a King Suite; I was told no more King Suites were available, although their website said the contrary - I needed to speak with a fourth Rep to get the King Suite reinstated - Two calls to the hotel manager were not returned. The hotel stay was actually quite nice, but I will not be coming back given the hours of inconvenience that I endured.</p><br></body></html>
