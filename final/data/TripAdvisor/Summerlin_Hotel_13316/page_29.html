Very clean, nice room, great bed (loved the down comforter). Lots of places for dinner nearby, and a good b'fast in the hotel. Went to Red Rocks Canyon (very close by) which was beautiful. Staff was very nice. A really good hotel for us.
WIFI worked PERFECTLY, which is rare for hotels and public places.</p><br>AVOID THIS PROPERTY - MANAGEMENT IS NOT HONEST<p>I made reservations using a third party reservation company and the hotel manager would NOT HONOR the room rate and said it didn't matter what was printed on my confirmation from Booking.com. She (Alexandra) said she could charge whatever she wan't and insisted on raising the rates by $30 for both Saturday and Sunday nights (but for some reason was ok with the discounted rates on the other 3 nights. If you can't trust the management regarding room rates, I suggest taking your business elsewhere. There are plenty of honest hotels in Las Vegas.</p><br>This is a great Hampton<p>We stayed at this Hampton Inn & Suites on NYE, after travelling during the Xmas holidays. The layout of the lobby is unique - like the Marriott great room concept. The staff were exceptional and the room we had was large and comfortable. It may not be on the strip, but it was a quick drive to where we wanted to go. Quite clean and even has a guest laundry if you need such a thing. I would stay here again!</p><br>Great Front Desk Staff<p>We had a very early morning flight to catch and wanted to grab one of their free breakfasts in a bag that all Hamptons offer. We noticed the bag contained water bottles which would be confiscated by TSA people when going through security. No problem. The front desk staff went behind the closed doors to the breakfast area, which had yet to open this early in the morning, and exchanged the water bottles for a banana. We easily went through security and enjoyed our breakfast items once we settled into the gate area. The front desk folks were very helpful, and friendly.

This hotel was also a great location if you want to hike Red Rock Canyon.</p><br>Excellent place to stay<p>We have stayed here twice while passing through town. Its been great each time. Friendly desk people and a good room. We wanted something away from the frantic pace of the Strip and this fit the bill perfectly.</p><br>Accommodating staff &amp; great layout for kids/parents<p>The front desk personnel were pleasant & helpful from the moment we walked in the door. I received a phone call within 30 minutes of arrival inquiring about my satisfaction with the room. The room was clean and the bedding was fine. The manager helped me out of a jam when she let me use her cell phone to locate a friend who was also staying there because I didn't have my phone. The breakfast area was large enough to accommodate many people at the same time and was always clean. The imitation scrambled eggs are my only complaint, as they were inedible. The lobby area is combined with the breakfast area and living room type area which was very inviting. We were traveling with other families for a hockey tournament and a group of our boys asked the front desk personnel if the could use the meeting room for mini hockey. They cleared the room for the boys and "game on". We were happy with every aspect of the hotel.</p><br>Excellent Customer Service......<p>This was our second stay at this property and we will be back again. The staff bent over backwards to get us a room at the end of the hall where were would not hear the elevator nor kids running up and down the hall past our room at all hours of the night. Our room was quiet except for the last night that we were there when a family with kids checked in next door and those kids LOVED to scream. Never once hear the parents tell them to pipe down and we are talking about midnight. The room was clean, the A/c worked perfectly (it was 110 outside). Breakfast was great and the waitress was as nice as can be. I say waitress, because she would ask people if they needed anything else and if they said yes, she would bring it to them.

We will be back, and hopefully the parents with the little monsters in the room next door will not.</p><br>Solid Hampton Inn Property<p>I have stayed at this Hampton Inn four times since January; each stay is a little different all relatively good. I visit Summerlin frequently on business and have stayed at numerous area hotels this hotel seems to work the best for me. The hotel is located off of I-215 on Flamingo road easy enough to get to. Check in was routine, the lobby is large and good to have quiet short meetings in. Rooms are spacious and clean with all the usual Hampton amenities. They have a nice work out facility and small pool. I would recommend getting to breakfast early as it gets very busy around 7:30am. There are several restaurants in the immediate area for eating take your pick. Two of my stays I have run into kids soccer teams staying at the hotel so be prepared for noise. All in all its a good Hampton Inn.</p><br>Great Service and Value<p>I recently stayed at this hotel and found their staff to be friendly and professional. Their rooms are clean and spacious and offer free wi-fi among other amenities, Their free breakfast is better than most hotel offerings.My only complaint is that the rooms located next to the freeway can sometimes be noisy, but this can be avoided by simply requesting a room closer to the lobby. I totally recommend this hotel for its value and helpful staff.</p><br>Rude front desk woman<p>Upon check in. she looked down to me like I shouldn't even be there and talked to me like I was completly stupid. Watch out for the woman, stocky, red curly hair, very rude!!!
Then the next morning, there was no hostess, the red headed woman ran around with her head cut off, angry, frustrated and very unprofessional and rude again!!!
But other than that, the room was fantastic, pool nice, Vegas a place to be, but not at this hotel if you got people like her working still. Sorry.</p><br></body></html>
