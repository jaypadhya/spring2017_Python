<html><head><h3>Hampton Inn & Suites Las Vegas-Red Rock/Summerlin Hotel Reviews Page 20</h3></head><body><br>Basic Hampton Inn- Good Location<p>This Hampton Inn was just OK. We are Hilton Honors members, and we wanted to stay in Summerlin, so this seemed to be the best choice. The breakfast was just OK compared to other Hampton Inns that I have stayed at. The beds were a little too much on the firm side for my liking, but I still managed to get a good night's sleep. The hotel is clean and very accessible of I-215, so getting to the Strip or the Red Rock area was easy. The employees were all very helpful, too. For the price point, it was a good value and good hotel.</p><br>Convenient, inexpensive and dated<p>Good price and nice option off the strip. Includes breafast and business center. But hotel needs to be updated. Carpet is worn and dirty. Pool is small. Noisy with kids on weekend, but quiet afterwards. Need a car, but a few restaurants and shops within 5-10 minute walk.</p><br>Not like any other HI<p>This hotel is terrible! Do not stay here! get your money back and run!!! I have stayed at many Hampton Inns and most are very nice. This HI is not! There is a horrific odor as soon as you get off the elevator (only one elevator was working), it smeeled like soled baby diapers, I hoped it was just in the hall but it wasn't, my room smelled the same. I asked to be moved and this was accomodated but the smell was the same on the first floor. It was not noticeable in the lobby, just seems to be in the hallways and rooms. After being moved to a different floor not only was the smell not gone, biut then it sounded like people were running back and forth in the hallway above me, this went on all night - not sure who or what it was, but I stayed there on a Monday night, so I can't imagine what the weekend noise must be like. The room was also dirty, hair in my shower, the carpets in need of replacement and the walls are dirty, they need to be cleaned and repainted. I highly recommend you find a different hotel!</p><br>Good value and comfy beds<p>Super comfy beds and good location. Off the strip so it was nice and quiet, in a nice neighborhood with lots of stuff around, like Starbucks, grocery stores, places to eat, and places such as target for whatever you forgot at home.</p><br>Hamton Summerlin location<p>This hotel is dirty the carpets in room 206 had not been cleaned or vacuumed. The bath room floor had not been cleaned. The carpet in the hallway at the elevators were torn and very very dirty. When we asked that the cleaning staff take care of our room nothing was done.</p><br>Low End<p>Rooms are extremely basic (and A/C in the room is either arctic cold or off), workout facilities extremely basic, food extremely basic. Hard to find and not near anything of interest. If you have no where else to stay, it would be fine but I won't be staying there again. You can get a lot more for a lot less in Vegas.</p><br>Hampton Inn, LasVegas<p>Great place! Hotel and Staff where all Professional and Courteous. Always will to go out of their way to be helpful. Would recommend this place completely. Location was close to everything, including Family, which made it the best choice for our stay.</p><br>Poor Experience<p>Between the room not being cleaned after the first night of a multi-night stay and the cleaning staff didn't close the door to the room all the way after cleaning, leaving the room accessible by anyone who decided to push the door open (without key).</p><br>Friendly, close to strip<p>Helpdesk was quite helpful. Hotel can be hard to locate if not familiar with area, but easily accessible to the strip. Breakfast was nutritious, well balanced menu. Best bang for the buck. Have stayed here numerous times. Room was clean and comfortable.</p><br>Good Off Strip Hotel<p>Hampton Inns are primarily aimed at business people, but this one is also very good for people wanting to visit the red rock area. The hotel is clean and very accessible of I-215. The breakfast is quite good. Some better yogurt might be nice.</p><br></body></html>
