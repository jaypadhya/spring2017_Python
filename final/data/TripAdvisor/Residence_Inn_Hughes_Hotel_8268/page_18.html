<html><head><h3>Residence Inn Las Vegas Hughes Center Hotel Reviews Page 18</h3></head><body><br>Quiet Location<p>This was an average hotel, but much quieter (and cheaper!) than staying in a large resort on the strip. We rented a car and drove to the strip where we had no problem finding free and fast parking at the resorts, so we didn't have to walk or take a taxi. The room was clean and comfortable.</p><br>Comfortable, peaceful.<p>Clean, comfortable rooms. The rooms are well equipped with range and utensils. It is away from the mad rush of strip and peaceful. One can have a peaceful stay at a reasonable price and go to strip on taxi which costs around $8/. The break fast is good and the staff are friendly.</p><br>Good - not great<p>I liked the courteous staff, the quick check-in, the spacious rooms, windows that opened a little, the excellent breakfast, the nice peaceful athmosphere, the convenient parking, the quiet location, walking distance to Strip, good places to eat nearby. These were the things that mattered to me so I was very happy with my stay.

On the negative: the decor is extremely dull and bland. The long boring hallways are depressing. The rooms felt like a rented appartment. The pool is small and depressing. Small pools can be a nice focal point. This one is not.

I liked the walk to the Strip but my companion thought it was too far away. Unlike the Fairfield Inn there is no shuttle.</p><br>good location/decent rooms<p>stayed over a weekend. Plenty of parking, decent pool/lobby. Plenty of dinning in same business center and also close to strip/HRH. Was upgraded to a 1 bedroom, plenty of space with two 42" flat screen LCD's. Issues-- AC doesn't run if your not in room Hence it's 105 and A/C is off all day when you walk in so the room is way to hot. Housekeeping never figured out the amenities ( no shampoo one day/no lotion either day in the driest place in the US/ etc). The A/C will prevent me from staying again during the summer, shouldn't be an issue in fall/winter/early spring.</p><br>Place to stay away from the strip<p>Rooms are nicely sized, clean and very comfortable. Service is very attentive and responsive. Wifi worked very well and decent laundry facility. Quiet location away from strip with some nice restaurants nearby. Plenty of free parking.</p><br>Average Hotel, doesn't have Marriott feel<p>Our party of 3 stayed here while in Vegas. Location is off the main strip casino area. There are no shuttle, we had our car so we could park in any casino for free when we did go to the casino strip. Overnight parking here at the Residence inn is free.
Rooms: The rooms were about average, the is a small kitchen, couch, bathroom all in one room. This is a residence inn. The carpet and decor are horrendous and bland.
Lobby: The lobby area seemed nice, the breakfast in the morning is plenty. They had waffles, yogurt, cereal, coffee, juices, fruits etc. Enough seating for a family and friends.
Pool Area: This is a small area for going swimming. But who goes to vegas to swim?
Gym: They do have a small gym with the cardio machines and free weights.
Overall I would stay here again just because I prefer quietness from the havoc from the strip.
Parking area: They have plenty of parking. On one night the main area was all packed, we parked in the back area, there are 2 levels of parking which we were able to see from our room.</p><br>Average Hotel<p>Very average hotel, decent location, close to many eating places, shopping, airport, strip. Quality of room was not up to par for the price. Very good breakfast. Small pool. Everything about the room seemed flimsy. Clean, comfortable bed.</p><br>A quick overnight in Las Vegas<p>My wife and I had a quick stay in Las Vegas recently that was more for business and less of a personal getaway. Our stay at the Residence Inn Marriott in Hughes center was comfortable and quite. The Suites are furnished with a good sized kitchen the size of which would be similar to a small apartment. The kitchen has a full fridge, microwave and silverware. Behind the Front Desk you will find a mini convenience center with snacks, beverages and frozen entrees that can be cooked in your room. The hotel lobby is geared well for the business traveler with a large flat screen usually tuned to National news a stack of News papers and ample seating. The morning Breakfast buffet was well supplied and regularly topped off. A stop in to the gym found a great dumbbell rack and several high end elliptical and treadmill machines. The pool area is nicely configured for resting and relaxation, but the building placement keeps the sun away until around 4pm. This might not be bad during the high summer months, but we were there in April, and really would have liked more sun exposure for our brief poolside stint. Since I am an early riser, and my wife is a late sleeper establishments like the Residence Inn Marriott in Hughes Center cater to my" get up and go" mentality allowing my wife some quite time. I can leave the room for a nice breakfast, hit the gym and then return to the room later with coffee and a muffin for my lovely wife!!</p><br>Nice, clean hotel<p>Our flight was canceled and we were stuck in Vegas for an extra night -- and every hotel on the strip was sold out! Fortunately my husband is Marriott Platinum and they found us a room at this hotel. I was pleasantly surprised at how clean this hotel was -- I was so afraid it was going to be shady. We actually slept really well. It's not fancy but definitely a clean, reliable Marriott.</p><br>Very average Marriott experience.<p>Nothing stand out on this stay to report. Rooms could have used a bit more attention... bathroom in our two bedroom suite could use some extra cleaning... deposits of dust and crud collecting in places. Hair were found in the shower. Location was close to a number of chains. Taxi was about $8 without tip to the strip.
Security was an issue in the parking lot - break ins had been reported - a number of military personnel were staying at the same time as us... uniforms and other items had been stolen from vehicles in the parking lot.
Did not get the feather free room I requested online.
Annoying number of pizza flyers were shoved under our door... made me wonder how many people that weren't staying in the hotel had access to the place.</p><br></body></html>
