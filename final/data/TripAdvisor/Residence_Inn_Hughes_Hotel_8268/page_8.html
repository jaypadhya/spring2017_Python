<html><head><h3>Residence Inn Las Vegas Hughes Center Hotel Reviews Page 8</h3></head><body><br>Good size rooms. Suitable for a family <p>Stopped here with work so I am unable to comment on the price, it is located a very short taxi ride away from the strip and is very easily accessible by car. Facilities include hot tub, pool, artificial tennis court with a basketball ring. The breakfast offered is very good and the location is ideal for a family as their is no casino on site. The suites feature a living area with a kitchen and two ensuite rooms.</p><br>the best staff, service, breakfast and room<p>due to a flood in my home I have been here now 5 weeks. Great location, near strip and not on it, safe, clean, staff friendly and very responsive. Best breakfast and my one bedroom suite is just beautiful. I mentioned to maintenance lady when waiting for elevator that hair dryer was going on and off and within 5 minutes she was at my door with a new one! Kitchen staff, cleaning staff everyone is just great.
Room Tip: I have a great view of the strip from my 6th floor on the south west side

The complimentary breakfast was very impressive, with its consistent delivery of hot foods, bread assortments, fruits, coffee, and Belgian waffle maker.

The rooms were kept very clean and the beds were comfy, and we both slept very well. It helped that the hotel was far enough from the strip, which provided quiet, peaceful evenings. Typically, the hotel was filled with families and professionals visiting for a conference, so we had no issues of disturbances within the hotel, either.

The only complaint we had was that the customer service at the hotel was less than helpful and borderline rude to us (and other visitors we spoke with). As long as you don't need any assistance when you are staying at Residence Inn, you will have a great stay.</p><br>Clean Hotel in Vegas<p>I choose this hotel because I wouldn't like to stay in casinos hotel that's dirty. The room is spacious, near Vegas you can see city view. The mattress is high quality, the breakfast had fresh food, free parking, and a kitchenette. I recommend this hotel for a person that cares about sanetize stuff</p><br>Awesome hotel!<p>We checked in on Friday and checked out on Sunday and I have to say - we had a great experience. The staff was friendly and helpful. The first day we went to the little market behind the front desk and bought drinks and were greeted with smiles and friendly chatter. On Saturday my brother in law came to visit us, and when I asked the front desk if he needed a parking pass for the day they told me he didn't.

We didn't get a chance to try breakfast (we woke up pretty late each day) but we did order pizza our first night from one of the flyers shoved under the door. It was pretty good.

The room was clean and comfortable. The hotel is in walking distance from the strip (or a quick drive) but is just enough out of the way that the area around it isn't loud or scary. It's in a great location.

Will definitely stay here again!
Room Tip: Our room was right next to the elevator, so every time someone would arrive on our floor we could he...

The operations of the hotel needs some help. Where is the customer service?! The only thing the hotel has going for it is the complimentary delicious breakfast, computer lab, Jacuzzi and awesome beds! Very "snudy" staff.
Room Tip: Views are okay, located near the new High Roller attraction. Pool is cold and gets no sun!

Green Features: Non-smoking hotel. WILL SNOOP THREW YOUR STUFF AND TRY TO FINE YOU WITH FEES! And then when you show concern, they talk gibberish!</p><br>High-Rise Comfort<p>The location is in close proximity to the strip, about a mile's walk and away from the hustle and bustle. Close to nice restaurants. Appealing decor, inviting lobby area, up-to-date business center, roomy, comfortable/quiet living and sleeping quarters and a very accommodating staff to handle any of your needs .The breakfast was hot, tasty and plentiful. Nice view of some lights from the strip from our 4th floor windows.
Room Tip: If you want to view the lights from the strip, choose an upper level floor.

This hotel is very large and has the largest breakfast area that I've ever seen. Breakfast offers many options and is well maintained. Our room was very quiet. Comfortable bed. Staff was professional and most helpful. I have zero complaints. Would stay here again.</p><br>Very good example of Residence Inn Quality<p>BIG R.I. - the biggest I've seen. Great breakfast buffet that stays well-stocked despite some very busy mornings. (Big groups stay here, military groups often decamp here, place is usually busy.) Great staff service for the most part. Never hear any noise from neighbors or in the halls.

A little pricey some days - more than I would expect. It is close to the strip and that's possibly one reason why - often cheaper to stay down here than on the strip, so maybe they can charge more. GREAT pool/outdoor seating area. No real bar or anything, but they do serve food and beverages mid-week in the early evening (like all the R.I's I've experienced.)
Room Tip: Haven't found a bad room yet -
