<html><head><h3>Residence Inn Las Vegas Hughes Center Hotel Reviews Page 4</h3></head><body><br>Great Family Hotel<p>We stayed here for a UNLV high school basketball tournament and it worked out perfectly. Our room consisted of two bedrooms and a full kitchen. Our floor had recently been remodeled very tastefully (they have not completed the upper floors so make sure you request a remodeled room). The toiletries are Paul Mitchell,which I personally love, but they only give you a couple & we had to ask for more (2 small bottles of shampoo & conditioner for a 2 bedroom- really?). I was also shocked they didn't leave any body lotions since it is so dry. The free breakfast is amazingly good & includes eggs, sausages, French toast, bagels, waffles, yogurt, fresh fruit, cereal, juices, coffee, etc. The workout gym & pool are small but nice. There is free covered parking & you are not too far from the strip. Except for the minor issues with the toiletries, the hotel was great & I highly recommend it.</p><br>Renovated hotel<p>This hotel is going through going renovations which the website adviced of, I booked december.stayed 6nights for edc week. The renovated suites are very nice equipped with all kitchen appliances and utensils needed for cooking and eating. The rooms are spacious and clean. Beds are very comfortable and ac does a wonderful job keeping it cool. The staff is nice but could be more welcoming and personable. WiFi was very fast considering the hotel was very busy, I as able to stream movies from Netflix and Amazon as well as play online on my wiiU console.

The breakfast was good offering a good selection of pastries as well as hot items. They also have small receptions Monday through Wednesday afternoon including free beer (stella),wine, fajita, chips and salsa and soda. Monday was a hit with all the men and women filling the whole lobby and breakfast for that! I enjoyed it as well!

The pool area is small but nice.
Distance to the strip is doable if it's not too hot.
Lots of walking distance restaurants with a Chipotle and piology opening soon.

Few things that I found to be off, the rooms have fridges with ice makers but no ice already made and hotel has no ice machines so you have to wait for the fridge to make ice which takes a while.
The tvs lag a bit while channel surfing and some channels are very staticky, no biggy since I rarely watch TV. The hotel should provide a sponge or dish soap to be able to wash dishes my hand instead of dishwasher since it's much faster if you just want a clean cup or plate.

Despite construction still happening we did not experience any noise distubances.some drilling could be heard but not enough to take away stars</p><br>Best of both the worlds !!<p>Young family with 2 adults and a 4 month old.

free high speed internet that is actually high speed

Room Tip: Higher floors tend to have better view of the strip

We called the front desk and we we're told there was nothing they could do. That we should have been told there would be construction work in the mornings. No where on their website, on the check-in process, or on the emails sent out to us before arriving does it state so. If you're just letting people check-in and withhold the construction information till they are woken up by drills going off, shame on you.</p><br>Close to Everything but still quiet<p>It's great when you can stay close to everything in Vegas but still be able to relax in peace. This Residence Inn was perfect for a recent trip with me and my 2 boys. The breakfast is awesome with a great selection. The pool looks pretty good although we never had the chance to use it. The rooms were large and they are doing some renovating to update all the rooms. this would be a great place to stay for a family vacation or for a business trip.</p><br>Old and needs renovation. <p>Hotel is in a decent location, good staff but the rooms is terrible... I gave it two starts for the staff and dinner they provide but the rooms I would not stay in again, good thing I only stayed one night.

Near food and stores, the strip is close but I would not walk.</p><br>Nice business hotel<p>Clean hotel with kitchenette. Free breakfast and internet. They need to improve restroom amenities and put water in the refrigerator in my opinion. Location is great for business travel and is just a cab ride from the strip. Plenty of restaurant options within walking distance.</p><br>Great place<p>We really enjoy this place very much. It is close to the "strip" bit somewhat secluded in the Hughes Center complex. Breakfast is ok especially for families. Service is good and the rooms are clean and well appointed. NOTE: right now they're renovating but it isn't bad. Just don't stay in the room all day</p><br>Good location. More appropriate for early risers and those with cars<p>Not a typical Residence Inn we stayed at given that it is a 11 story building. Checked in for one night and was put on the 10th floor. Despite having a party of five and 8 suit cases it was not too much hassle as there were ample trolleys at the entrance and getting up to the 10th floor was not too much trouble.

There was an eclectic crowd there including families and business travelers. Wi-fi was good. Overall, your typical solid Residence Inn that is great value for parties of 5-6 with their 2-bedroom + sofabed rooms with kitchens.

Only complaint is that the free breakfast finished very early at 9 am on weekdays, though coffee is available throughout the day.</p><br>A decent off strip option<p>I stayed two nights at this hotel, the property has been partially renovated as in the lobby from what I can tell. The rooms are clean and spacious and very functional. Most of the furnishings are in decent but aging condition especially in the kitchen and bathroom, looking a bit dated but otherwise fine. Bed was on the soft side for my taste.
The hotel is very busy, large groups, crowded breakfast, revelers, but its fortunately not a casino and it was quite quiet in my room. The hotel is near a cluster of strip malls and some decent dining walking distance away and the strip isnt a long drive or taxi ride.</p><br></body></html>
