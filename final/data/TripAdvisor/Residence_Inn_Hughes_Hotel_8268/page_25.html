<html><head><h3>Residence Inn Las Vegas Hughes Center Hotel Reviews Page 25</h3></head><body><br>A bit cramped up<p>I am a fan of residence inn properties and being with a family it usually works well with us. We decided to stay here for our trip to Vegas. The property is the new "high rise" type of Residence Inn hotels and is about 12 storey building. We had a 2 bedroom suite on the 7th floor with a view of the strip in the distance. Check in was swift . The suite had the usual 2 bedroom layout of residence inn but I felt this one was a bit more cramped up. The living room was tiny and if the sofa bed was pulled out then there was virtually no space left to move. Each of the bedrooms had a queen bed and again this can be too tight for 2 persons to sleep. Placing a crib would be again a difficult issue. The bathrooms were however bigger than the usual residence inn types. The kitchen and dining space was again very cramped up. Moreover I felt there was some problem with the ventilations in the rooms and hallways. The air con in the rooms even at maximum could not cool very well as , according to the in house engineer , one unit serves the livign room and one bedroom and another unit is exclusively for another bedroom. So that meant one of the bedrooms could be really stifling. Moreover, there was smell of food or waste trailing in the hallways etc and I really could feel there was some fault in the ventilation. Having said these points, to be fair to the property, its really very convenient in many other ways. The staff are excellent. There is free wireless internet in the rooms and also 2 PCs are there in the dining area with a printer to serve as a "business center" to check mails and print documents. Laundry machines are kept on the 3rd, 7th and 11th floors. Free parking, free breakfast and a social hour from Mon-Thurs all are excellent value for money. Location wise also its a short drive to the strip and there are many restaurants nearby. Overall its a nice property except for the size of the rooms and the ventilation issue. It can be very good value for a small family but for a bigger group it might be too cramped up.</p><br>Never stay at a mega-resort - stay here instead!<p>The Marriot Residence Inn is a class place. I can't for the life of me understand why anyone would want to stay at one of the mega-casinos, even the nice ones like Bellagio, Wynn, Ventian, etc. We went through each of them and checkin was loud and noisy, and sometimes near the casinos. If you enjoy crowds, noise and walking with suitcases and wet bathsuits through crowded gamblers and gawkers, then go to the mega-casinos. But if after a day or night of partying and gambling and you want quiet - then go to this Marriot. We booked a 2 bedroom for $199/night and it was wonderful. The kitchen and the bedrooms and the quiet were wonderful. And you are 3 minute from the strip by car.

Wireless Internet works very well and a pleasent suprise was the laundry machines on 3 of the floors. After being on the road for 2 weeks, being able to do a laundry for 75 cents (washing machine and dryer and detergent are each 75 cents so save those quarters) was worth every penny being at the Marriot. The complimentary breakfast was fine and once you calculate the value of the breakfast and the free Internet, even a $199/night room comes closer to $120/night at a mega-casino.</p><br>Perfect for business AND pleasure!<p>I just came home from my 2nd stay at this property. My initial stay was for a family reunion a few years ago and this recent stay was for business. Both stays were fantastic. Based on my most recent stay, my 2 brm suite was immaculate and fresh. The bed was incredible and I never experienced any noise. All those I worked with at the front desk were friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable.

The location is off the strip, but not terribly far. I didn't have a rental car, so I walked to Bally's, one of the nearest strip hotel/casinos. It took me about 20 minutes. The walk isn't the most scenic and I sometimes felt concerned for my safety, but taxis are readily available if walking isn't a comfortable option.

The pool is probably the biggest disappointment. It's small and there's no ambience whatsoever. Many of the casino pool areas win in that department. But--the pool does stay open later than most on the strip.

I recommend this hotel for families and other travelers who relish a quiet break from the action and glitz of the strip, yet want to be just moments away! It's great for leisure and business travelers. Rates seem to fluctuate, but can beat rates offered at mid to luxury-scale casino hotels. For those who are rate conscience, you must shop around and must be aware that rates can change from day to day.</p><br>Squeaky Clean<p>We were looking for a hotel that would give us quiet time after the hustle and bustle of the Vegas strip. This location was perfect. It was not too far off the strip but far enough to provide that needed quiet space. Our room was immaculate, smelled clean, and was at a perfect temperature when we arrived. As non-smokers we were so happy to see that this was a smoke-free hotel. We thoroughly enjoyed the complementary breakfast each morning. They went above and beyond the usual fare. We were impressed with hotel security, particularly at night when we found we needed our card key to enter through the front door. We found two restaurants right across the street for dinner, both excellent, and a member of the hotel staff gave us a Marriott card that provided dessert at both locations. We would definitely return on our next Vegas vacation, and we are very particular about where we stay. For those of you Starbucks fans you only have to walk across the parking lot of this hotel.</p><br>Great Hotel for almost anyone<p>Great hotel, we had several guys out for a bachelor party. We had a 2 bedroom suite and the kitchen and 2 bathrooms were great especially the living room where we could all hang out. If you want easy access to the strip, this is not your hotel. We had to take a cab each time to and from the strip. The restaurants nearby and the free hot breakfast buffet is a great touch. This hotel needs a shuttle just like Residence Inn South, but maybe they have avoided this to keep the partiers away! If you come to Vegas for fun and to party and need a Residence Inn, stay at the one south near Courtyard and Fairfield Inn & Suites. If you are a family or business person who needs fine extended stay lodging with great restaurants nearby, stay here.</p><br>Great pet hotel<p>Just got back from 3 days in Vegas Thanksgiving weekend. Was able to book room on Marriott website day before at $149 a night. I needed to bring my chihuahua because of late notice of trip. First time traveling with pet.

Hotel is a brisk walk from the strip so you will need a car or taxi. Taxi was $15 from hotel to Mandalay Bay. Make sure you say Residence Inn Marriott - taxi drivers seem to make the distinction by that. The hotel was really nice. Nicely done lobby, inviting. Check in was a breeze. Very friendly staff. PET FRIENDLY. Dog area in the back with plastic bags. The area is quiet so I was able to go on walks with my dog. I didn't hear any barking the entire time I was there. The room and hotel smelled clean and fresh. I stayed in the 1-bedroom suite. Very nicely done. I am OCD so carpet, drapes, sheets, couch cushions, bathroom is a real source of concern for me. Everything seemed new, clean, tastefully done. I found a Petsmart about 10 minutes from downtown that had a doggy day camp for $18. Hotel charges $100 pet fee. I was fine with the paying the $100 for the dog being at the hotel and the $18 for the day time (7 am - 9 pm) at Petsmart.

Continental breakfast was not terrific but for free it was okay to start out the day. Free wireless internet in room and on grounds was great! TV was broken in living room, called room service, it was fixed within 15 minutes.

I would definitely stay again with pet or if looking for a low key, clean, quiet place to stay.</p><br>satisfied very satisfied<p>We stayed at the residence inn in las vegas. Although it was not on the strip, it was less than a mile away. Not a problem since we had a car.
The hotel entrance was great. There was no lines when i checked in and i was done in 5 minutes, that was fast. maybe because i had booked online with marriot.
We stayed on sept 16 sat, and left sun sept 17. we had booked two rooms. One that was a bedroom suite ($169) and a two bedroom two bath suite ($229). the great thing about booking with marriot online is their cancellation policy. You can cancel on the day of your arrival upto 4pm without any fees. We had to cancel the one bedroom suite on the day we were supposed to check-in, i did so on the internet and that was it. If i had Booked with other travel websites (orbitz, travelocity etc..) i would not have been able to cancel without being charged. And they add xtra fees(service fee plus taxes, )
Marriot only charges for the room plus tax when you book with them. And their prices were the exact same low price anywhere on the net but without the service fee, so you still pay less by booking by them(marriot).
The bedroom suite was great since it was my small family(4 of us. 2 adults and two kids under 6) and my parents and sister it was just perfect. The room had two bedrooms on either side with their own bathrooms and a little sitting area in the middle. It also had a kitchenette, with a full size fridge/freezer.
The beds and pillows were comfortable not stiff or hard.
The beds in the bedrooms were queen and the sofa in the sitting area was a queen sofa bed. So three queen beds in one suite, plus a kitchen with a dining table three tvs, free internet connection and best of all FREE BRRAKFAST. It was a great breakfast, eggs, potatoes, toast muffins, cereal, juices, yogurt, pancakes, waffles, coffee, fruit, & cottage cheese. Oh yes, they also had sausege patties and i think i saw ham and bacon(we dont eat these due to religios purposes) everything was great.
i highly recomend it.</p><br>Perfect choice for a couple with two teenagers (not big gamblers!)<p>Stayed here as a party of four - two adults and two 16-year old girls. Only a two night stay as we knew that Las Vegas can get very tiring! We had our hire car from Los Angeles, and I would recommend having a car unless you're on a stay put holiday.

We used Marriott Reward points and also paid a small points upgrade to have a two-bedroom suite. This was on the 10th floor and looked towards the Strip - from a distance of about three-quarters of a mile, the view was quite good enough - reminding us where we were without being on top of the madness. The suite was perfect for our needs. It had a small living room area, open plan to the dinning table and kitchen. The very efficient air con was controlled from a thermostst in the living area - an essential with outside temperatures over 110 degrees! There was a big fridge and freezer with internal icemaker, full cooker, microwave - which the girls used to make popcorn - supplied by Residence Inn f.o.c., and a coffee maker - again with supplied coffee bags. Each bedroom - both with one Queen (5ft) bed had its own ensuite bathroom. The wash basin/vanity units being in the approach to each bathroom which has bath with shower over and the WC behind their own door. Overall we had 3 TVs in the suite.

There was a menu in the room for ordering meals to be delivered from a local restaurant, and whilst we were there other menus were pushed under our door. There is a good range of restaurants on the doorstep, if you'd prefer to eat out - covering all price ranges, and most are easy walking distance.

We particularly enjoyed the local fish restaurant "McCormick & Schmick's" where the food was lovely and the service excellent. It was our wedding anniversary, which I mentioned when I booked the table earlier in the day, and when we arrived we were shown to a private booth, and the menu (which they print each day) had been modified to wish us a Happy 21st Anniversary with our names in big print at the top of the menu - a very nice touch and and instant keepsake!

The Residence Inn serves breakfast and evening "appetisers" with drinks - beers and wines included - and all of this is complemetary/included in the price of the room. They offer both paper and china plates, and most guests seemed to opt to use paper plates and eat in the large communal "Hearth Room" which had two large plasma TV screens running the news at breakfast time. The TV volume was turned low and subtitles had been activated (very considerate). The standard of the food on offer was "average", with limited choice but plentiful (scrambled eggs, sauasage patties,ketchup, biscuits/scones, waffle makers, toast machine, bagels, spreads, juices,cereals, coffee, tea, yoghurt, fruit), but the staff were all friendly and kept the food well stocked until about 15 minuted before the end of service, when everthing quickly started to disappear. So, if you want the freebies, don't leave it until the last minute. Very helpful for families with hungry kids. The evening appetisers vary throughout the week, with a Taco special on a Thursday night.

The rooms/suite cleanliness was immaculate and the cleaner did wonders with the girl's room (she must have had teenage daughters!!). The beds were very comfortable.

There is a rather small pool out the back, with towels supplied. The pool deck is a real sun trap - or oven - depending on your point of view, but there are parasols and you can buy soft drinks from the cooler display next to reception. There's also a small exercise room which is fine if not too many people want to use it.

Residence Inn (Hughes Center) is clearly set up for longer-stay guests - many of them business people. However there's a good mix, and not everyone is on a 9-5 with their lap top over their shoulder. You can easily chat to other guests in the Hearth Room or keep to yourself.

One last point - this is not a fiull service hotel and there are no bell staff to help with luggage, but they have those smart looking luggae trollys for DIY use - a devil to steer, but what you need for a group of 4. All the parking is self-park, and FREE - compare that to many other hotels in Las Vegas!!

Would definitely book here again. We all enjoyed Las Vegas, went to a show at the HIlton and didn't lose or spend anything on gambling - although it is an education to watch other people losing their money -although depressing too to see how sad and alone many of the gamblers looked.</p><br>Recommended by me too....<p>Decided to stay at this Residence Inn even though my conference was at another hotel again this year. I got burned at that other hotel (Palace Station) a couple of years ago which led to my learning about TripAdvisor. As an alternative, I looked for something in the Marriott chain this year (had a free night certificate) and the Residence Inn Hughes Center showed up as recommended.

I'd score the hotel score above average-to-excellent and am giving it an "E" for cleanliness, a very comfortable bed and a truly no-hassle stay including parking. Read Hank from Huntington Beach's 9/27/05 review for specific details that I observed to still hold true in 2006. Also, no casino 'action', noise or drunks inside the Residence Inn (although you don't have to go far to find the gambling!)

If you are meeting friends in Vegas, have them meet you at this hotel and then everyone walk to dinner....all quality restaurants are within EASY walking distance. They are so close, you can check them out in person and pick your favorite. This was a very big plus - not having to drive in Vegas traffic to go to dinner. One of the restaurants named in Hank's review is now a Bahama Breeze and the Hamada Japanese restaurant has a sushi bar (ate there twice).

Beyond being a comforatble stay, you'll experience some sanity in the craziness of being in the m iddle of Las Vegas.</p><br>Liked this hotel.<p>A refuge from the crowds on the strip. Quiet, clean, spacious. The breakfast is very nice( included in the room rate). Close to several good restaurants. A mild negative is the walk to the strip- down a very busy street that's pretty ugly.</p><br></body></html>
