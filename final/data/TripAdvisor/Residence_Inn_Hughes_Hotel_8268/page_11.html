<html><head><h3>Residence Inn Las Vegas Hughes Center Hotel Reviews Page 11</h3></head><body><br>Pleasantly Suprised<p>My parents and I stayed here for two nights in a 2 Queen Studio Suite. The room was clean and quite spacious. Having an in-room kitchen (inc. fridge, sink, dishwasher, microwave) was very convenient as we could store left-over restaurant food/desert for later. I liked how the bathroom (toilet and tub/shower) was separate from the sink and mirror outside - this made getting ready in the morning with 3 people that much easier! The staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful. The breakfast was tasty. The WiFi was reliable. Overall, it was a very pleasant experience (my parents would agree to this too).

The only con I can think of is that it is a bit of a walk from the strip. Usually the distance would not bother me but since there is so much walking to do in Vegas, at the end of the day, that extra walk back to the hotel was just not appeasing. If you have a car, then you don't have to worry about this!

Tip for walking people: Cut through Bally's and Paris hotel to arrive on the Strip that much quicker!</p><br>Solid off strip hotel<p>Stayed one night in April. Clean, good breakfast, walking distance to food and beverage. No casino, but no "resort fee" i.e. "Money Grab." Quiet. I would stay here again in a heartbeat. It helps to have a car if you want to go gamble or see a show.

Cheers!

Marius</p><br>Good for business traveller<p>Hotel is clean and functional. Staff friendly and helpful. Free breakfast was standard, breakfast area clean. It tis about a mile walk to the strip. It does have a kitchen, WiFi and free parking. Easy walk to restaurants.</p><br>Oasis from Vegas<p>I am always in transit through Vegas, but never going to Las Vegas. This hotel is like a welcome respite from all of the crazy Vegas stuff. We stayed here twice in 2013. Once enroute to Christmas holidays and once in the summer. The rooms are nice Marriott quality. My parents agreed that it was nice to be in Vegas, but not feel like it at all. Very close proximity to the airport and the strip. Nice amenities, good breakfast. Great restaurants next to the property.</p><br>terrific accommodation in Las Vegas<p>"We stayed at the Residence Inn for three nights in a two bedroom suite. We were extremely pleased with all aspects of our accommodations! The rooms were bright and always clean. The full...and nicely equipped...kitchen was a bonus. The free parking was also a bonus. The free breakfasts were delicious...the items that were supposed to be hot were and there was enough of a variety to suite everyone. The one mile+ walk to downtown Las Vegas wasn't bad at all. Our weather was super so we enjoyed the adventure. Taxicabs were easy to find as well. There are several excellent restaurants we walked to that were within minutes of the Inn. We patronized two of them during our stay and the meals were terrific. The Inn staff was helpful, efficient, and always cheerful. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Inn and would definitely stay there again on our next trip to Las Vegas."</p><br>Great Place, Great People<p>We stay here a lot. Very comfortable, a good location. What really makes it so pleasant are the people who work here. From the front desk to the food service, maintenance and housekeeping staff, everyone is competent, caring and well trained.</p><br>Lack of cleaning details in room<p>The location for me was good as where I needed to go each day was walking distance. The room was not cleaned really well at all when I checked in and you could see that the details is not what they focused on. With it being close to Convention, it was almost as if they focused on turning rooms over quicker, not cleaner and quicker. The filter had about 1/4" of dust on it. Not sure last time it was changed.

Won't stay here again. Outside of hotel is nice, but once inside the rooms they need to focus on the details.</p><br>Nice Stay, Good Location<p>This was my first time staying at this hotel. The staff handled checkin were very pleasent and helpful. My room was clean and in great condition. While I only stayed one night I could see an extended stay with no problem. A well equipped kitchen area, full sized refrigerator, microwave, and other amenities are perfect for several days stay. The breakfast, which was included, had all makings to start the day off right.

There are also several restaurants well within walking distance that make this a perfect location for a stay.</p><br>My Home Away From Home<p>I travel to Las Vegas several times a year on business with my husband and we always stay at this hotel. The staff is consistently very friendly and accommodating. The rooms are clean and spacious. And the location is great. It's in walking distance to several really good restaurants and about a mile from the Strip. I don't enjoy staying at casino resorts due to the smoking, noise, and crowds so this is the perfect solution for me. I also like the complimentary breakfast. It's convenient not having to leave the hotel when you first get up in the morning and has a good variety of options to choose from.
Room Tip: Request a high floor for a good view of Las Vegas

Clean, friendly place. Great free bar and snacks at times during the week which is a good saving. The beer is tasteless American stuff so I took my own. My wife was with me and she likes wine but again it was not nice stuff but as it is free you cant complain can you? We are used to European beer and wine so try to stick to that as it is kinder to the hangover next day for us.
The barbecue is free to use as is the pool but it does not get much sun.
You can walk to the strip but at night it is best to use a taxi. They charge about a dollar a minute so not bad at all.
Outside the hotel there are few great restaurants just be careful of the characters you may meet in the street. We had a few people asking for change was all.
Vegas was never on my "to do" list and it still is not. Away from the strip it is a dangerous place. If I did have to go back I would happily stay at this hotel again though it does not have a bar or restaurant. They do have a couple very nearby as I said and they do good food and drink.</p><br></body></html>
