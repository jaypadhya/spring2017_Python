<html><head><h3>Residence Inn Las Vegas Hughes Center Hotel Reviews Page 19</h3></head><body><br>Good off strip location but rooms very plain &amp; spartan<p>I stay at several Residence Inns during the year & this one was a bit of a disappointment. The breakfast was typical Residence Inn fare but the layout of the breakfast room caused traffic jams as only 1 person at a time could comfortably get to the coffee as there was limited counter space & the milk/juice dispensers are in the same corner. People waiting for the waffle makers would be in the way of guests trying to walk through to the coffee or get food from the other side of the buffet.
My room had 2 queen beds & the smallest kitchenette i've seen in a Residence Inn. The pub style table was so small that I couldn't imagine 2 people actually eating at it. The higher-style chairs would not be comfortable for senior citizens. There was an old style clock radio that was unreliable so I just used my cellphone. (No MP3 connectivity like in other RIs. Only 1 light between the beds so any reading would disturb the other occupant. Desk was on top of bed, which was on top of outdated dresser to which the flatscreen Tv wad bolted. TV was really only positioned for viewing on couch or chair, I dragged the dresser away from the wall as much as the cords would allow so that I could swivel it order to view it from the bed. No inroom safe in closet as most RIs have. Furniture seemed worn & mismatched.
Walk to strip would take brisk 20+ minute walk or $9-11 cab ride depending on traffic.</p><br>Nice Hotel Off Strip<p>The hotel was clean and encountered no problems with the room. Staff always greeted us as we passed through lobby. The breakfast room and lobby were under renovation, but the hotel used a conference room for breakfast seating. Food was normal hotel fare, but they did have a variety. Enjoyed the ease of parking- unlike the large casinos where you can drive around in the garages looking for a place to park-twice parked in lot, 3 times on first floor of parking garage. It was nice to leave the noisy casinos at night and come back to a non smoking building and quiet rooms. Would definitely consider coming back again.</p><br>Excellent hotel<p>The hotel is very clean, it is very nice. Breakfast is great. Excellent hotel.</p><br>Average but good distance away from strip<p>My husband and I went to Las Vegas for a conference and had no desire to stay near the strip so we chose this hotel.

We also regularly stay at Marriotts and in particular the Residence Inn. This Residence Inn was not to the standard of others that we have stayed in. We were upgraded to a one bedroom suite which was spacious however the breakfast was disappointing. The staff were OK but not exceptional.

If we have to go to Las Vegas again we may stay at this hotel again simply because of its distance away from the strip.</p><br>AMAZING!<p>This hotel is one of the best I've stayed in ever! Amazing amount of space in room, great service at front desk, great atmosphere, great pool, and an unexpected free dinner downstairs as well! A great view of the flashing lights outside the window! I would definitely come here again if I came to Vegas again. A great ending to a 3-week vacation!</p><br>Convenience &amp; Value - Near the Strip<p>Residence Inn is within easy 5 minute walking distance of the Strip via Flamingo Road. A great value compared to prices just a couple of blocks away. The hotel is clean and offers great amenities ( pool, living room, full kitchen, breakfast included, evening social hour on selected weekdays). Top notch restaurants and steak houses surround this property.</p><br>Good staff-poor mgmt &amp; absolute worst breakfast at a Residence Inn<p>All employees were working extra hard but hotel understaffed-staff could not keep. Not a manager in sight. I felt really bad for housekeepers and breakfast attendant. Breakfast was horrible-eggs in edible, could not keep up due to being understaffed and breakfast room was filthy. Too bad as they have a good location.</p><br>Good stay for a Vegas weekend.<p>This is a nice high-rise residence inn about a mile off the strip. Way cheaper than the masive casino resort properties. Clean rooms, good staff, a nice outside patio and pool. A high up room facing the strip is available, and I suggest asking for it. You'll want to have a car if you stay here, as the walk to the strip is less fun than the walk ON the strip.</p><br>Excellent stay in Las Vegas<p>Could not have wished for better time in Vegas - hotel service was excellent - staff very friendly - rooms exceptionally clean - great hotel if traveling with pets - good amenities - will defiantly go back to this Marriott</p><br>A nice hotel<p>The hotel was well placed with plenty of places off the strip to eat nearby. If you want to go to the strip you can walk there in about 10 mins, so it's not very far. The rooms aren't the biggest but they do have seperate bedrooms and bathrooms if you are staying in a twin room. The double rooms are much larger, whereas the twins feel a little cramped at times. There is also a little kitchen area and a large fridge in each of the rooms which is quite handy. The rooms can feel dark at times and there are no lights on the roof so I had to put all the smaller lights on as soon as the sun went down. No bar either which isn't great, however their is a little 'shoppette' by the reception. Breakfast was ok not great but ok, was always very busy and could do with a bigger area with more seats. The area is being redesigned at the moment so it even more of a squeeze, but hopefully will be better once done.
Room Tip: Try and get a higher floor, the view is better the higher up you are.
