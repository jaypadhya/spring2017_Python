<html><head><h3>Residence Inn Las Vegas Hughes Center Hotel Reviews Page 14</h3></head><body><br>EXCELLENT STAY IN LAS VEGAS<p>I visited Las Vegas with my family last week and stayed in the Residence Inn Las Vegas Hughes Center. Everything about this hotel - from service to comfort - rates excellent. The room with the comfortable queen beds we rented were big and cozy with all amenities including high speed internet, big lcd tvs, plush sofas, spotlessly clean rugs, and neat and spacious bath rooms. The hotel offers a free, very luxurious breakfast.
Its location is ideal in that it is not on the noisy Strip, but at at the same time is not far from it.</p><br>Nice, quiet off-strip hotel<p>I stayed here during a convention and, as I usually do when I go go this city, was looking for a non-casino, off-strip hotel that was still close enough to the convention center and to the strip for dining out. This ended up being ideal in that sense. Quiet, yet close enough to everything. I used the business center and the fitness center, and both were fine. Pleasant atmosphere, friendly staff, good value. I'd stay here again because I really appreciated being away from the commotion when I wanted to rest, yet only a reasonably priced taxi ride away from everything.</p><br>Good alternative<p>Stayed here in a two bedroom unit with in laws on our trip to Vegas.
Decent rooms, a bit stale for a Marriott brand. The residence inn Las Vegas south, even though same style.... Far more well maintained and up kept.

Small pool. Decent breakfast.

Good location in Hughes center.

Parking was tight, not a ton of spots.</p><br>Great Place<p>My sister and I stayed here after a rafting trip and I was impressed! The rooms are nice and clean and the bed was comfortable! (she slept on the Sofa Bed and was comfortable as well) friendly front desk and employees.
It is a very nice place to stay.

We left too early to have breakfast but some friends of ours told me they really enjoyed it.

Definitely will stay again.</p><br>Las Vegas stop over<p>The family enjoyed there stay at this location and had no complaints. The swimming pool was enjoyed by all including the hot tub even though the outside temperature was approaching 112 degrees. There were plenty of restaurants around this hotel and the front desk offered coupons to recommended hotels. There were plenty of places to sit during breakfast.</p><br>Needs some improvement<p>We stayed here over the July 4th holiday and were a bit disappointed.
Our 2 teenagers tried the breakfast and came back upstairs warning us about the cold, runny eggs and the undercooked potatoes. Needless to say, we didn't even bother trying the breakfast ourselves. After all, my husband and I were still tired from staying up late .... this was Vegas, so why do they stop serving breakfast at 9:30??
My husband went to grab a cup of coffee in the lobby (after they had stopped serving breakfast) only to be told that there was none available.
The biggest surprise to me was the non-existence of ice machines. This was the 5th hotel on our road trip and we had become accustomed to filling up our cooler every morning, especially in 112 degree temperatures!!! The desk clerk however was very helpful and immediately got us some ice from the adjacent kitchen.
The beds were comfortable, but my husband had trouble sleeping because of the extremely noisy fridge in our room.
The room was clean and well kept, except for the dirty vent we came face to face with when taking a shower.
As far as decor, the small pictures of Tuscan (?) villages all over the room seemed kind of odd. I had kind of expected a Las Vegas theme, but that's no biggie.
The location was great if you don't mind walking a bit to the strip. There were good restaurants all over and we really enjoyed PF Chang.
Knowing what to expect I would stay here again. I would come prepared, enjoy my own breakfast in the room and make sure that the fridge is producing ice.</p><br>Great location!<p>I have stayed at this hotel numerous times when I am attending trade shows at the Sands Convention Center. I always walk to the Convention Center unless the weather is too bad. There is every kind of restaurant all around the hotel many right in front. Straight shot to the airport and only blocks away from the strip. The strip is not my thing so this hotel works great for me.</p><br>Great place for stopover in Vegas<p>I stayed in a suite here with my family the night before and after a trip to the Grand Canyon. The staff could not have been more helpful, and we all slept well. Breakfast had options for everyone in our party. Free Wifi worked without a hitch. Seemed central enough to Las Vegas attractions if you are interested in the glitz.</p><br>Great Hotel close to everything but not to close<p>This is a great high rise Residence Inn by Marriott. The rooms rae great and it is well located near everything but not in the hussel and bussel . Facilities are excellent and there are a choice of many restaurants close by that are frequented by locals. Car parking is a breeze . Would recommend this hotel to anyone on vacation as long as you aren't looking for 24 hour go go go .
Real people stay here its safe comfortable and affordable . Kids can have fun and parents are assured that there is no sleaze. I stay with Marriott a lot and don't be put off by a couple of the other comments some people are never happy !</p><br>Average but adequate<p>Dont expect the full Vegas treatment. This is a typical Residence Inn with no extra frills. Rooms are looking a little dated but kept clean and tidy. Walking distance to a number of decent restaurants but a cab ride to anywhere on the Strip. Free breakfast but dont expect gourmet.</p><br></body></html>
