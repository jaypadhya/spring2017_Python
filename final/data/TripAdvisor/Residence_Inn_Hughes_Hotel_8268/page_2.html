The hotel is in a great place, which is about a mile from the strip and it has about 10 restaurants just across the parking lot. If you want to gamble, there are several casino's just walking distance (5 min). The hotel itself was very clean, very friendly staff, great free breakfast as well as a lite dinner 4 times a week. There is also free parking, nice size outside pool, and nicely maintained grounds around the hotel. If you want to go to the strip, Just down the road is the Caesar's Palace, Paris, and the Bellagio!! You are also only 2-3 miles from the airport for an easy car return. We will stay at this hotel again on our next visit!!</p><br>Great place to stay in Las Vegas<p>After three nights at a hotel on the strip, we were happy to spend three nights at the Residence Inn. Nice updated rooms with full kitchen. Comfortable beds and free breakfast. Breakfast was average but definitely will go back if we go to Vegas again. We had a rental car so location was fine.</p><br>No surprise Residence Inn by Marriott<p>This is your typical Residence Inn by Marriott. Well run, clean, and everything you have come to expect from a Marriott. The only caveat might be the area just to the East of the hotel is pretty sketchy. I would make sure you park as close to the front door as possible and avoid the parking structure for safety. Don't leave any valuables in the car. It's Vegas and the "locals" are mostly low lifes in that area of the city.</p><br>Noisy Room-A/C issues<p>I'm a platinum member, I stay in a lot of hotels and lately Marriott has been horrible. The A/C would not go on auto fan meaning it had to run constantly or else be turned off, not an option when it's 100 degrees. Then the A/C intake vent in the bathroom would make a noise every 30'seconds like water spraying or aerosol can spraying. My wife and I could not sleep. Also, cheapest shower curtain I have ever seen in a Marriott. Breakfast was good.
Room Tip: Make sure you listen before you unpack so you can switch rooms if necessary

Green Features: Plastic cutlery & plates at breakfast, but dishes in the room</p><br>Away from the strip<p>This is an excellent location if you are going to Vegas on business. It is away from the strip but close enough for the entertainment if you choose. Within walking distance of very good restaurants and there is a Starbucks across the street.
Clean rooms and excellent service.
1 mile from the convention center is an easy walk.
Room Tip: high floor west view

We had a horrible experience with the airline flying to Las Vegas, but you made us forget all and enjoy our vacation at full. Breakfast is great with multiple options and all were very good. All the family enjoyed the toppings for the waffles and the scramble eggs (nice touch, I never seen in other hotels). The ladies taking care of the rooms were great keeping our room in order and were very flexible with their schedule as we were traveling with our pet. The front desk was very helpful before our arrival and during our stay. We are looking forward to come back and stay again here.
THANK YOU!</p><br>Perfect!<p>Stayed at this hotel for the weekend in Vegas with my parents. We attended a concert and did some shopping. This hotel was at a convenient location very clean and friendly. The room had a kitchen and was set up as 2 rooms in one. Breakfast was also very good. Will be staying there again!</p><br>Just Remodeled! September 3rd, 2015<p>My wife and I stayed here for 2 night 9-1-15 thru 9-3-15. Very clean common areas and rooms. They just remodeled, so its a great time to stay here. Very affordable rates, and located close to numerous restaurants with in walking distance. Short cab ride to the Strip for $10. Staff at the hotel is very nice and prompt with checking in!
