<html><head><h3>Residence Inn Las Vegas Hughes Center Hotel Reviews Page 20</h3></head><body><br>Home away from Home<p>We love to stay here to break up the trip for our kids on our way to California. We have stayed here several times and every time is amazing. The location is also very convenient. It is close enough to the strip that you feel like you're in Vegas but far enough away that you feel comfortable bringing your kids there.The rooms are always well kept and the service is Wonderful! The staff has always been accommodating and willing to do what they can to make our stay as comfortable as possible. The breakfast buffet is also very delicious and always a nice way to kick start the day. I totally Recommend Staying Here!!!
Room Tip: Great view of Vegas from upper floors

Everything goes well at this RI which is well located just close enough, but not too close to the various things to do in town. About five minutes from the airport and very close to the good (non-casino) restaurants like Mortons, McCormik and Shmidts, PF Chang, and Ferraros.

Oh, and always a hand written note welcoming me as a Marriott Rewards member. A very nice touch.</p><br>Not the best but not bad<p>I'd give this hotel four stars if it weren't for the Heating Ventilation Air Conditioning (HVAC) unit blowing directly on the bed. Who puts a bed directly under the HVAC unit? Las Vegas can sometimes be rather warm (and can even occasionally get quite cold in the winter) and it isn't always an option to sleep without the HVAC unit on. Your choices are "off" or blowing right on you.

Hotel was completely full when we were there so parking wasn't quite as easy as it probably would have otherwise been. The parking garage is behind the hotel and it is a bit of a schlep around to the lobby but a bit of exercise is not a bad thing.

Friendly staff. Continental breakfast is adequate (and sure beats not having anything).

Really if it wasn't for the HVAC unit, it is fine.
Room Tip: See if you can get a room where the HVAC unit does not blow directly on the bed.

The fare from the airport to the hotel was about $10.00 plus it was not all that far away. Just enough so one did not hear airplanes.

Admittedly, there was not much in the way of shops nearby but then one is not usually in Vegas to visit small shops, right? The room was clean, bright and quite large with a full kitchen and big LCD TV which swiveled toward the bed or the couch.</p><br>Clean, updated and near the strip.<p>Our flight was severely delayed, so we weren't able to check in until 3am. The lady at the desk was still very pleasant and cheerfully granted my request for a late checkout. When we got to the room we found a handwritten note from the manager welcoming us as Marriot Elite Rewards members--a nice touch. Breakfast was far above average. Clean, modern and very well managed property.</p><br>Very nice stay!<p>Very clean high rise Residence Inn that looked like it was recently rennovated. It appears to be in a nice neighborhood with many restaurants nearby and approximately 1 mile to the strip.</p><br>Excellent place to stay with family<p>Very close to the strip, yet far from the crowd! On a day with nice weather, or during mornings/evenings you can walk to the strip. Else use the public transport. The hotel is clean and rooms are spacious. Service is good.
Room Tip: Take the rooms which give an unobstructed view of the strip!

I booked a suite which had a full kitchen, dining table, chairs and nice seating area with large tv. It had two ensuite bedrooms and all for just $159 + tax. it was definately worth it. If we go back I would consider staying there as my husband and I both drive. Even if you dont a cab to Fremont Street is only $25 max. Free breakfast had a good selection and a nice seating area. Staff were very friendly and helpful
Room Tip: Two bedroom suites are great for couples travelling together

Room Tip: is 100.00 dollars for the pet fee a little much but at least is a great place to stay with pets .
See more room tips</p><br>Good stay<p>Good choice to stay here. Clean, quiet and very good value for family compared to booking two rooms in strip area. A bit far from strip but no problem if you have a car. Nice kitchenette which is comfortable to cook. We will stay again.</p><br></body></html>
