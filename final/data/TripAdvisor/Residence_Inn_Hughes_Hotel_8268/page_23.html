<html><head><h3>Residence Inn Las Vegas Hughes Center Hotel Reviews Page 23</h3></head><body><br>No Bed Bugs!<p>I am most choose another hotel based on the prior rating, however my stay was excellent. Rooms were quite, clean and bug free. Breakfast daily was good. Easy access to anywhere if you have a car. 4-5 first class restaurants right outside the parkiing area. Felt very safe at this location as a solo travler.</p><br>good value if you stay off-strip<p>This is a pretty standard Residence Inn...here are facts:

1. $10 (with tip) taxi from here to Caesars Palace (closest Strip hotel).
2. 15-20 minute walk on Flamingo Blvd.
3. Rooms are nice- plenty of space.
4. No king beds, which I didn't like or understand.
5. Breakfast is standard, with many choices.
6. Free wireless internet
7. Fitness center is pretty small.
8. Service was very good.

Hard to beat this place if you don't want to pay for a Strip hotel and all the extras (internet, breakfast), but do the math if you aren't walking- $20/day.</p><br>Bed bugs<p>I stayed there for one month and ended up with bed bugs. They say they investigated but I don't believe they did anything......other than get rid of the mattress. Several of my co-workers complained of the same thing but they weren't bothered as much as myself.
I had to go to the dr. and get medication and was advised to take everything that I had brought home with me, put them in plastic bags, and put them outside in the sun for 3-5 days. Luckily I didn't bring any home with me. I would never stay there again.</p><br>BICSI Conference<p>Decided to stay at the RI, as the MGM did not seem very inviting. Hotel is minutes from the strip & overall good location. Room seemed a little cramped (1 BR). They do serve a light dinner a few nights per week with beer. The breakfast is typical.</p><br>The best place ever,friendly staff very very helpfull,full amenities.<p>I am fan of this hotel since december 2006.It was in Reno an amazing experience.Extremely convenient place to stay.In Vegas I forgot lot of my personal stuff in the bathroom drawers and I called to find out .They had it all and shipped everything to me by overnight fedex @ no cost.The best customer service ever.I am so happy.Thank you so much Residence Inn staff.</p><br>Exclusive Marriott<p>I Have been for the first time to Lasvegas .We had reservation from Priceline.I have always had good results with priceline and will continue to use them. This property was clean and the grounds were well maintained.The rooms were clean,food was very good, Nice things about this hotel is it comes with a complimentary internet and breakfast which was of high class. I will surely stay here when I go to Vegas again and will also recommend this to my friends. A complete and satisfactory stay indeed.We also loved the secure parking lot and convenient location.</p><br>Good option in Vegas<p>It is easy to get in and out of town from this hotel. The hotel is just about a mile from the strip, which is close enough. It is a quiet hotel with rooms typical of Residence Inns. The breakfast is better than most other RIs. Its proximity to several good restaurants is an added plus.</p><br>Quiet and Pleasant<p>I liked our stay at this RI. It is a typical RI about a mile east of the strip. We were here just for one night and only spent about 5 hours sleeping after a night of gambling. Comfortable except for that it smelled a little funny at first but got used to it I guess. Stay there if you want to be close to the strip but do not want all the noise and craziness of the strip.</p><br>Nice Residence Inn, better than most<p>This hotel sits a mile or so from the strip off Paradise Road. The rooms are standard Residence Inn suites (nice and familiar to me). However, the hotel is much taller than most Residence Inn hotels and thus you are likely to have a good view from your room. I had a great view of the mountain ranges in the distance - beautiful.

The breakfast was the standard Residence Inn breakfast, with waffles, eggs, biscuits and gravy, sausage, yogurt, cereals, toast, coffee, juices, etc...

My only complaint is that they keep leaving you messages asking you to join the Holiday Club, which I presume is a timeshare or something. I wouldn't expect to be bothered like that at a Residence Inn. I may have given 5 stars were it not for this.

One other thing, there is covered garage parking, which protects from the fierce desert sun (I visited in December so covered parking wasn't really a necessity.)

If I were visiting Vegas on vacation, there is no way I'd stay here, but for work it's perfectly suitable. It's too far from the strip that you need a car or need to cab it. Fortunately, there are plenty of cabs waiting right in front of the hotel at all hours ready to take you places.

By the way, the pool was unspectacular, but it was too cold to swim anyway.</p><br>Outstanding. Nice quiet nights in Las Vegas<p>No gambling, not on the strip, no loud parties... No problem ! We stayed here for $100/night. Very nice rooms. Outstanding free hot breakfast. VERY quiet. No obnoxious drunk teenagers. Wow, what a great cheap way to experience Las Vegas without all the unpleasant side effects Vegas has.

Rooms were nice clean and had everything we needed. Staff was very accomodating and friendly.

But most important was the peace and quiet me and my wife had at night.

Restaurants near the hotel are within walking distance and are good.

Cab rides to the strip range from $7.50 to $10.50 and that is how we traveled. A great place to bring the family or just to have a nice quiet vacation.</p><br></body></html>
