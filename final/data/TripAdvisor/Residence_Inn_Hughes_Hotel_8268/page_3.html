<html><head><h3>Residence Inn Las Vegas Hughes Center Hotel Reviews Page 3</h3></head><body><br>Nice and quiet<p>If you need a great hotel just a little ways away from the strip then this is the hotel for you. As the title states it was nice and quiet. Property looked great inside and out. Clean and comfortable. Staff was excellent as always. No casino noise while staying here.</p><br>Quick Vegas Getaway<p>Went to Vegas over the LDW with a group of friends, and we decided to stay at the Residence Inn. We normally stay on the strip, and to be honest have never considered staying anywhere else so staying at this hotel was not really something we were looking forward, but WOW did this hotel left us impressed. Our room was clean, and so comfortable. It was nice avoiding all the crowds after a crazy day, or night in Vegas. They provided us with a hot breakfast every morning, and also located by several great steak, and seafood restaurants. It was located fairly close to the strip. It was only about an $8 cab ride to Ceaser's Palace. Overall we had a real great trip with friends, and a great hotel for the crazy LDW. Thanks Marriott Residence Inn.
Room Tip: small, smoke-free, and kid friendly

We were all so pleased we chose to stay at this property!! There is no "smoky" casino in this property! It is perfect if you have kids. The rooms are all-suites; condo type with kitchenette, living and dining area complete with full size refrigerator, stove, microwave, untensils, plates, etc...

Breakfast is included. They serve hot & cold items. Plenty of food & drink choices.
Property has a swimming pool & hot tub; lots of parking.

Our room was very newly renovated. All furniture and appliances were brand new! The bathroom was super clean. This hotel is still undergoing renovations but the workers never bothered us. I never saw any worker doing construction nor heard any noise from their work.

The hotel is located at the beautiful Howard Hughes Corporate complex and right next to the best restaurants in Las Vegas. I was so pleasantly surprised that it is right behind Fogo de Chao, my favorite Brazilian steak house in Las Vegas. My friends and I wanted to dine at Fogo de Chao and we were so happy that we did not have to get back in our car to get there. We just walked a few steps and we were there!!!

I highly recommend The Residence Inn Las Vegas Hughes Center!!
Room Tip: Ask for the newly renovated rooms.

Rooms very very large and well equipped complete with fridge and kitchen. There were various pizza / take away menu's put under my door too. I would suggest that this is not the hotel from where you can explore the strip, its about a mile away. This is somewhere to chillout away from the bright lights and the noise and rest up after a tiring week of adventure in the Canyon. I ate at Mc Cormick and Schmick over the road, which was very good.

The breakfast buffet was excellent.</p><br>If you need your room serviced on a timely basis, please avoid this hotel.<p>We were out all day and got back at 4pm only to find out our room is not clean. I am a elite member so ofcourse I was a little taken aback. I call the front desk and speak to a lady by the name of Blanca. The most rude and impolite person in the hospitality industry I have ever met. She tells me I need to call to get my room serviced. This is a Marriott Residence Inn and not some motel for me to call for service. I asked for the manager Rudy and he was away for 2 days. We shall see if he calls but as of now, please avoid this property for your las vegas stay.</p><br>Great Hotel!<p>Only a couple of blocks from the strip. Excellent accommodations with kitchens, delicious breakfast and beer/wine happy hour. The staff was very efficient and friendly. I have stayed there three times and will definitely stay there again.</p><br>Good Location, great price<p>My son and I stayed here as part of a Grand Canyon white water rafting trip and it was very convenient to the Strip; an easy walk of about a half mile. There were easily a dozen nearby restaurants, some with very good food and quite reasonably priced for Las Vegas. The suite rooms (and kitchenettes) were very spacious, reasonably appointed and comfortable. The room AC was up to the 111 degree weather, and the pool (while not overly large) was nevertheless very welcome. Breakfast was decent and the staff pleasant and helpful.
Room Tip: We had rooms on the 3 floor and 8th floor and both were quiet and pretty much the same.

I loved the full kitchen and will stay there again. The only downfalls were the loud A/C unit and I had a room by the elevator and could hear everyone passing.
Room Tip: Ask for a room away from the elevators!

Green Features: They promote saving water and reusing your towels, which I liked!</p><br>Nice location<p>We stayed at this hotel 4 separate times in the month of June and July 2015. It's being renovated so some floors are nicer than others, there is also some noise if you are unlucky enough to be near the renovation. Overall the rooms are spacious, the location is quiet and convenient and the breakfast is great. Good pricing and friendly people. We will be back.</p><br>Clean, Quiet, Calm<p>I was in for business and stayed overnight. The room was clean, quiet and the hotel was peaceful. I wasn't visiting Las Vegas for play, so it was nice to stay in a hotel that didn't have gambling, smoking, carousing, etc. I would stay here again should the need arise.</p><br></body></html>
