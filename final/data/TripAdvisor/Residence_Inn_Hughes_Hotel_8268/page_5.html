<html><head><h3>Residence Inn Las Vegas Hughes Center Hotel Reviews Page 5</h3></head><body><br>Good all around hotel<p>The location is $10.15 by taxi from the airport; the snacks and beer were great; the room was very nice along with the toiletries; the only problem was a dog in the sitting area with a very bad temper which the hotel should have made go to the room. I would stay here again. It was a part of a trip down the Colorado river via Grand Canyon Expeditions. Everything was handled coming and going very professionally.</p><br>Nice place, a few rough spots<p>Stayed Friday May 8th. Requested a 1 bedroom suite and got a newly refurbished one for the night.

Check-in was great, the counter person was a trainee but she handled all we threw at her like a pro, a 5.

The room, smallish, kitchen had enough tools to do non-fancy good meals. Shower was great, did not have a low flow shower head that I have to use for 30 minutes before I feel like I had a shower, in and out in 5 minutes and totally refreshed.

Queen bed was firm, a plus for me.

Wi-Fi was strong in the room and worked very well, only issue is that it is open, you have to pay for a more protected line.

One Major issue, the window in the bedroom was broken. Seems that the lower right corner was not sealing when shut and with the strong wind pressure it was a mild roar (wife said it sounded like a jet) Fixed it by opening the front room window and then blocking the whistle under the door with a towel.

Slept good that night.

Breakfast was above average, sausage patties, scrambled eggs, fried potato wedges, and french toast. I think FOUR of the Belgian waffle makers and a good range of toppings, fresh fruit (oranges and bananas) were not very good, cut melon was good, a good selection of cereal, some Granola/yogurt, a good selection of blueberry, peach and strawberry yogurt cups, and a bowel of yogurt to put over fruit or cereal, a nice touch in America. Staff was going over it often to keep it clean and stocked.

Wife said the Oatmeal was very good.

Nice place to stay if on business or if passing through and want a better than average place..</p><br>A quiet place near the Vegas strip<p>The hotel was quiet, and the staff were very friendly and helpful. And NO slot machines! For me, this was a much better experience than one of the hotels on the Strip. Rooms are very spacious. We stayed here before and after a Grand Canyon rafting trip.
Room Tip: Rooms over the entrance way have noise from the the airport. Our second room was around on the side...

Nothing fancy, but everything you need to feel relaxed on an extended business trip. There is an excellent buffet breakfast, plenty of choice for most appetites. What really makes this hotel stand out though is the staff, without exception they all were friendly, engaging and diligent. I would not hesitate to stay here again or recommend to others.</p><br>Girls' weekend in Vegas at the right speed<p>Three of us wanted to enjoy some shows and food last weekend. I was a little concerned about reviews talking about construction at the hotel, but we stayed on the second floor in a 2-bed suite and it could not have been quieter. The free breakfast every day was abundant and suited us perfectly. So nice to have it run until 9.30am. There were lots of tables as well, so we didn't have any problem finding room.
There is no shuttle, but the 15-20min walk to the Strip is direct and pleasant in the evening temperature, and of course, you could take a cab. Starbucks is right next door too. It was great for the three of us who love the action of the Strip, but then want to "go home" afterwards and not live in it 24/7.
On our last day, one of us was ill (not because of the hotel), and the gracious staff allowed us an extended late checkout. Platinum membership pays off, but in addition they were very understanding and asked about our friend when we checked out.
I thoroughly recommend this location for your Vegas visit.
Room Tip: Call to check if construction is happening (which is the case I believe right now), and ask for a ro...

Green Features: Certainly no water conversation going on. The shower was a deluge! (Indulgently so)</p><br>Weekend in Vegas<p>Hotel is off the stip, but close to several eating establishments within walking distance. Very quiet hotel and awesome breakfast spread, get there early to avoid the crowd. Love the firepit outside. Would stay again.</p><br>Another great stay!<p>Once again we selected the Residence Inn, Hughes Center, for our annual Las Vegas trip, and we were not disappointed. While this hotel is by no means a luxury hotel, it has many positives which make it a great base of operations in the Las Vegas area. We prefer to stay off the strip, and the location is great--easily accessible to all the tourist attractions, although not walkable (not for us, anyway). Parking is plentiful and right outside the door, unlike the big hotels. While the room decor was a bit old (renovations have just started), our suite was spotless and well equipped with everything we needed. Best of all, the hotel is smokefree and very quiet. Despite the fact that the hotel was nearly full, we seldom saw any other guests other than in the lobby/breakfast area, and never once heard any noise in our suite. We had a nice view of the mountains and city. There was some airplane noise, mostly in the morning, but we quickly got used to it. If you are sensitive to it, request a room facing north, away from the airport. During our stay, we received advance notice that water would be shut off from 10 pm to 5 am, in preparation for the renovations. Gallon jugs of water were delivered to each room. Fortunately, we found that the shutoff did not affect us at all. Breakfast was pretty good, and despite the crowd, the staff kept all the food items well stocked. I had no trouble streaming Netflix via the free WiFi. Every hotel employee that we met was friendly, considerate and helpful. Special thanks to the front desk staff, which gave us a late checkout after we learned that our flight home was delayed by serveral hours. We are definitely planning to return next year and look forward to seeing the renovations.</p><br>Great Hotel, Staff and Food<p>Although the location is a 15 minute walk to the strip, it was still a great place for the family to stay for our week in Vegas. The suites were spacious and clean. The breakfast was great with lots of options and always fresh fruit. The manager's reception was always hot entr√©e and salad with dessert (Hamburgers one night, some cheese and jalapeno poppers another night). Front desk very accommodating. Elevators came quickly even though hotel sold out when we were there over New Years. Great music playing in lobby and car port area. Definitely would return!</p><br>Probably not stay again.<p>I thought for what they charged $159, It was not worth it. Not much to it. Bed was super uncomfortable. BreaKfast is always good but the bed was a disappointment. It was not as nice as other RI I have stayed at. I like all Marriott properties but felt this was pretty average.
Room Tip: stay away from elevator and ice vending machines
See more room tips</p><br>Great location with remarkable Staff<p>Very happy with our clean ,comfortable suite on the 10th. floor and it's view of the Strip. Our Lab enjoyed his walks in this lushly landscaped and quiet business park location. When front desk staff noticed we were waiting 20+ minutes for a taxi ( due to circumstances beyond their control) they provided us with water, crackers and candy bars. This genuine gesture of concern made a very strong impression about american hospitality and the staff of this hotel in particular on our guest from Germany. Thank you for an excellent 3 day stay!!!
