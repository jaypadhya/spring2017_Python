However, my top tip is to try and get a room at the back of the hotel. Mine was at the front, and when the winds blow from the north the hotel becomes a grandstand for aircraft taking off from the short runway at McCarran airport, and it can be quite noisy from 6 am!

Also of note is that the drains smelt badly - although I'm not sure this isn't just related to this hotel...
Room Tip: As I said in the review - the back of the hotel should be quieter

The furnishings are very plain and somewhat worn in spots. Bed was comfortable. Room is large. Good for business. You will be disappointed if you are expecting luxurious accommodations – it is a Residence Inn and they have their place in the market. This Residence Inn is slightly dated compared to most. The Residence Inn on Dean Martin Drive is much newer but further from the action. Location of this hotel is OK; surrounded by decent restaurants but a stiff walk to The Strip. Overall a pleasant stay in a basic suite hotel.
Room Tip: Rooms overlooking the pool are quietest.

The carpet was frayed, the towels were worn looking and thin...certainly not what I am used to at a Marriott property. The plus to this hotel is the location. It is within walking distance to the "Strip". The breakfast was also very good with a very good selection. There are several restaurants within walking distance as well. I think there are better choices of hotels for the price.</p><br>not quite a 4 but not a 3<p>We wanted a place in Vegas for our family that provided a kitchenette so we didn't have to eat out all the time. We found it here at the Residence Inn. We appreciated the BBQs also. The free breakfast in the morning was very good (the kids loved making the big waffles). The rooms were pretty basic but served our purpose. We liked the location - it was about a 20 minute walk to the strip. But because we went to many other places other than the strip, the hotel was great to drive from because the traffic on Las Vegas Blvd is busy!! We could see the strip from our room which is nice (especially to see the fireworks with the younger one). We took advantage of the swimming pool and hot tub. Security patrols frequently and we felt quite safe. No issues with the wireless internet.
Room Tip: ask for a view of the strip

Green Features: there is no recycling at all. we still separated our recycling out but have no idea whether it was just thrown in the same bin. Such waste at the breakfast area.</p><br>Great Place to Stay in Las Vegas<p>We have been staying here regularly since 2004. The place is clean and well maintained.

The location is quiet and convenient to all of Las Vegas. It is 1 mile east of The Strip. The roads in the Hughes Center make for good shortcuts when wanting to get anywhere.

The week we were there they had the evening reception Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. This Residence Inn has the best evening reception food of any Residence Inn we stay at. They also have the best breakfast selections of any Residence Inn we stay at.

Overall the Hughes Center location is an excellent choice and is much more convenient than most hotels in Las Vegas.
Room Tip: Upper floors on north side have great view and are quiet.

The staff here was very friendly and helpfull in every way. Room was neat and clean and was the rest of the hotel. The included breakfast buffet is one of the best I've had while traveling and the kicker of an evening meal and beer or wine twice a week was a very welcome suprise. Defitnetly worth considering if in the area! Several excellent restaurants within walking distance</p><br>Wonderful Ammenities and Great Location!<p>My boyfriend and I recently stayed at the Residence Inn Hughes Center on our anniversary, while we were traveling across country from Minnesota to San Diego. We were delighted with an anniversary gift from Andrew upon check in and a beautiful room on a high floor. One of the best things about Residence Inns is the kitchen in the room with everything you need to feel at home. What made this Residence Inn so special is it's location to the Las Vegas strip. The hotel was extremely quiet but it was still only a 15 minute walk to the strip. We were so glad to get a good nights rest, while still getting to enjoy everything Vegas has to offer. I would recommend this property to anyone visiting Las Vegas and looking for a comfortable place to stay!</p><br>Good value<p>I have had to be in Vegas several times a year for work for the past decade+. This is the first time I stayed at a non casino hotel. I really enjoyed the peacefulness of it. This hotel is very conveniently located to a variety of good and great restaurants. It is also within walking distance to the convention center and the strip (approx 15 mins) if you are not in work shoes (heels). The staff were very attentive. Breakfast and evening snacks were ok but not great. Good value.</p><br>Great location off the strip<p>Just completed another stay at this hotel. For those who need an extended stay or larger space off the strip this hotel is perhaps the best out there. Just one mile back from the strip in the midst of a high end office/residential area the location offers multiple dining options within walking distance. Choices include Morton's, Del Frisco's, Bahama Breeze, Roy's, Fogo De Chao, McCormick & Schmicks, Gordon Biersch and Starbucks within 100-300 yards away. Add to that a very nice walking jogging area behind the hotel and you have a winner! This Residence Inn is a high rise hotel style, not the typical style 2 story house type property. Friendly staff and clean rooms make this a great choice. Cabs are frequently waiting outside to whisk you where you want to go. Figure about $7-$10 to get to the strip. Small pool area with fire pit and hot tub are nicely tucked behind the hotel, but don't expect a high end designer pool. Of course hot breakfast included daily and evening reception during the week nights are nice benefits as well, but the food served is basic at best. Will stay here again.</p><br>Great room, heavily used<p>This hotel is near enough to everything, and far enough away at the same time.
The staff where helpful and the two bedroom suite was a great layout.

There was an odd smell tot he room, but housekeeping soon sorted that out but the strangest thing was the blood splatter on the ceiling... Joking, we said it must have been used in an episode of CSi. I'll add a pic of that when I can find it.

It's popular with lots of foreign and local Air Forces doing training and exercises at nearby Nellis.

All in all, a perfect retreat for seeing the sights that Vegas had to offer - great car parking too :-)
Room Tip: All rooms are easy to access to elevators and the rear exit to the car park
