<html><head><h3>Residence Inn Las Vegas Hughes Center Hotel Reviews Page 24</h3></head><body><br>Very Good But Review Credit Card Statement<p>We returned to this Residence Inn for a one night stay in a 2 bedroom unit. As before, we were very happy with the accommodations, free parking close to the hotel entrance, convenience to the Strip and to the many restaurants within walking distance of the hotel.

Two minor complaints that prevented me from giving an Excellent rating:

1) Soaps are wrapped in a new type of wax paper that is extremely hard to open. We had to use a knife to slit the package.

2) Upon receipt of our credit card statement, there were two separate $3 charges. I called the hotel to inquire and was told they were for bottled water. We did not use any of the bottled water, as we had brought our own supply for use in our car on the long daily drives. The gentleman on the phone was friendly and apologetic and said he would credit them back to our credit card. So be sure and watch your statements.

We really enjoy staying at this Residence Inn and will return on future visits.</p><br>Summer in Vegas, was I nuts???<p>Searched forever for an affordable 2 BR suite in Vegas, even in the doldrums of August. Ended up at "old reliable", Residence Inn.

But wait... this isn't the usual pseudo-suburban looking stand-alone units found at other RI's. This is a sleek, modern 12 storey new construction and just 1 miles from the strip.

Great property, though the floor plan for the 2 BR's is the same as always. The front desk is very friendly, but watch out for the pitch for their new skyscraper timeshare, The Marriott Chateau.

A bunch of restaurants are right outside the door. And given the blast-furnace temp's of August (108 in daytime, 95 at night) you'll scamper across the street to find chow.

Nice pool, basketball court and the usual carb-fest at breakfast. We stayed twice at both ends of a week-long Vegas / Utah vacation.

Alas, you can't use Marriott Rewards points for 2 BR units, but at $199 they're a steal. Check the Marriott weekend discount e-mails for further discounts if they remain as empty as we found them.</p><br>Nicefamily hotel close to the action<p>This is a nice "residence type" hotel within walking distance of PFChangs and Bahama Breeze Restaurants. There are services nearby, drug stores, etc. It is not a walk, but more of a cab ride to the strip and Fashion Show Mall. We had rental car--free parking can be found almost everywhere in Vegas.

The pool and hot tub are nice and draw a decent scene in the evenings. During the week there are cocktail hours in the evenings. There is a pretty great buffet breakfast every morning (gets a little crowded around 8:30 so go earlier or later). Parking is good.

There is no decor to speak of, but nice amenities and good family location.</p><br>Not bad, but could be better<p>This place is located in the right place, near great restaurants and within walking distance. There is also a large casino across the street, if you like. This place looks good until you get to your room. Then it is just a plain room with no touch of home. Considering it is an extended stay type lodging, I would have thought that just plain white walls went out with Motel 6. Not here. If you can get over that, the rest of the place is great with a good hot breakfast, evening reception with wine and beer and a meal. Free papers include the WSJ, USA Today, and the local LV paper. There is covered parking and it is free. Cab wait outside if you need one. My room was very clean, however its walls showed signs of wear and patching. The room kinda smelled like an old grandmother's house, but was tolerable. They have a pool and exercise room that looked inviting, but I was too busy working to take advantage of those things. Yes, I would come back.</p><br>Nice and Quiet, Pet Friendly<p>I stayed at this hotel for a week while I took a class that required a lot of study. I was hoping it to be very quiet. It was even better than a library! We took our little kitty, which the hotel welcomed. The front desk staff was very helpful and friendly. The maids were very respectful of our schedule and the food bar in the lobby, both breakfast and in the evening, was excellent. The room and the hotel was exceptionally clean.

The hotel is immediately adjacent to a Starbucks, Kinkos and some of the best restaurants in Las Vegas (less than one block).

If you are looking for an alternative to a cigarette smoke filled casino hotel with excellent service (without a bunch of screaming drunks or hookers) this is it.</p><br>Excellent Propery<p>We found the Residence Inn Hughes Center to be an excellent property in a great location.
This property is walking distance from the center of the Strip. We rented a car and drove to the casinos since virtually all of them provided free self parking as well as free valet parking. Why walk long distances when you can drop your car off at the front door for the price of a tip?
The rooms were large and clean with the typical quality I expect of a Marriott property.
The hotel is surrounded by a number of good restaurants including Lawry's, McCormick@Schmick, and Bahama Breeze.
Staff was courteous, attentive and friendly.
Free breakfast buffet was excellent and included hot entrees such as eggs, sausage, bacon, and waffles.
They have an evening reception several nights each week, where they provide what amounts to a light dinner, free of charge.
Nice pool as well.
We cannot say enough good things about this property.</p><br>I just love it!<p>I probably sound a little crazy, but this is absolutely one of my favorite hotels for a getaway. My husband and I live in Las Vegas, and we love to get away for a long weekend at the Res Inn. Its surrounded by great restaurants, including our favorite, Del Frisco's, and its just a quiet way for us to get away from the madness of our daily lives. The complimentary breakfast in the morning is great, and the pool is awesome. The handful of complaints I have are about the gym, which is a little pathetic, but its a smaller budget hotel, so what would you expect. I also don't care for queen beds, I'd prefer they have king beds, but other than that, I just love the place.</p><br>Not bad, not bad!<p>If you take the Hughes Center area on its own, it's actually quite a convenient place. Several restaurants are within walking distance from the Residence Inn and a Starbucks/FedEx Kinko's right across the way. The hotel itself is great, too. A nice, small hotel which might be preferable for some folks who dislike the overwhelming nature of the hotels along the Strip. The rooms were very comfy and clean. The bed was great with a variety of pillows and extra blankets, just in case. The shower was wonderful, a huge bathroom counter and plenty of towels.

Alas, as great as the hotel was...it was not on the Strip <sigh>. This is probably a "plus" for some folks, but honestly, if it weren't for the seminar I had to attend at the Residence Inn, I definitely would not have picked this hotel. Plus, there were several Strip hotels that had better deals going than the Residence Inn (I paid $149 per night). Taxis were about $7-10 each way to/from any hotel on the Strip...which seemed like a lot for just a few blocks (though on a warmer day, with more comfortable shoes, I wouldn't hesitate to walk).

I really did love this hotel on its own. Just a shame it wasn't closer to where all the action is. I give it a 4 for the hotel itself and a 2 for the location.</p><br>A Bit Pricey for Residence Inn<p>October 2007 â€“ I spent two nights at Residence Inn Hughes Center Hotel while I was attending human resources training at the nearby Westin. I also stayed two nights at the Renaissance Las Vegas. The Renaissance property was a much better value and better stay for me than at the Residence Inn - Hughes center. I wrote a review on the Renaissance.

The folks working at the Residence Inn front desk were not very welcoming or friendly, except for one staff member during my visit. The cleaning folks were friendly.

I checked in around 11:30 a.m. - 12 Noon. I asked for quiet room away from the elevator but was given a room nearby a elevator, but was told I could exchange rooms later on when more rooms were available. The plus was the room had separate bedroom door.

The room did seem a bit cramped for Residence Inn for a one bedroom suite. I took a nap on the sofa and later on went back to lobby and transfered to another room on the same floor. the new room was more roomy and away from the elevator.

That is probably one of my biggest concerns is being too close to
a elevator with a loud ping. You need to wear ear plugs. See my review on the Club Quarters Midtown in New York City. I learned my lesson there!

The bed was okay. The room was quiet. Standard Residence Inn suite features.

The inroom pay for view movies were not available due to technical difficulty.

The refrigerator and microwave worked okay as did everything else in the room.

The room was very clean and housekeeping was excellent during my stay.

Like many Residence Inn's in the Gatehouse, you have access to internet and can print out hardcopies. Just ask for a code at the front desk. There is a time limit.

I had breakfast at the downstairs breakfast area. The offerings were a bit more than your standard Residence Inn. Most items were okay. I did become very ill after eating breakfast on my second day. This actually caused me to miss my flight. I suspected the waffle dispenser. Though I can not be certain. Typically Residence Inn's use individual bottoms of waffle ingredients that seem chilled. It seemed to be food poisoning.
I don't think I have ever experienced that at Hotel property.

I also ate nearby at the Bahama Breeze which was good. There are other restaurants nearby like McCormick & Schmidts and Gordon Bierch. But it is away from the strip and there is no Monorail access nearby, so if you do not have a car, it could be a good walk to the strip. I also ate at some of modest restaurant venues at the Venetian, which were not so good. Also service at the Venetian is suspect. Was lucky at the Hilton in terms of gambling. Decent buffet at the Hilton too.

One thing I like best about the Renaissance property is it is close to Las Vegas Monorail and the Monorail is better than driving around Las Vegas. If your staying the Hughes Center, you need a car or you need to take a taxi. Unless you do not mind a good walk which can be brutal in the summer.

I paid an internet group rate of $229.00 verus $110.00 and while I like to have microwave and fridge in the room, I'd stay at the Renaissance over this property due to the price, service and convenience of the monorail. I have also stayed at the Residence Inn Convention Center for much less than this property. I stayed at the property because it was just down the road of my training at the Westin. But I probably won't stay at this property again.

For the price I paid, I would not stay at the property unless it was around $100.00 less.</p><br>Absolutely loved it!<p>I stayed at the Residence Inn Las Vegas Hughes Center primarily for business. It was so quiet and clean, I couldn't have asked for more! The suites look like they've been completely redone - clean carpet, clean furniture, bed linens were nice. I'm a bit of a neat/clean freak and I had no issues while I was there. This is a non-smoking hotel and after staying here, I can't imagine going back to a strip hotel where everything you own smells of smoke. The fridge was a full-size fridge, so I had plenty of room for sodas and leftover doggie-bags. The free breakfast in the morning was decent. I only really enjoyed their pancakes and not much else. But they have make-your-own-waffles, eggs, potatoes, bagels, cereal, donuts (one kind and not very good). They rotate thru french toast, sausage gravy/biscuits, pancakes, etc.

There are numerous restaurants surrounding the hotel - as a female walking alone, I didn't have any problems. They all had pretty good food. Thankfully there was also a Starbucks right next door, open 24hrs! There is free parking at the hotel and it was extremely easy to drive around Vegas (I was surprised).

After staying at casino hotels on the strip, this was a nice change of pace. If you're coming to vegas primarily to sit by a pool and gamble, this isn't the best place, but I had no issues finding parking at casino hotels in the evenings for my gambling fix! I didn't really see any families with children at the hotel, mainly those on business and young (but quiet) groups of friends.

Highly recommended!!</p><br></body></html>
