<html><head><h3>Residence Inn Las Vegas Hughes Center Hotel Reviews Page 15</h3></head><body><br>Time to try somewhere else<p>This was the fourth time I've stayed at this hotel and most likely it will be my last. It's a while since I last stayed here but I'm sure it has gone downhill in that time. There was only ever one person at the front desk meaning every time I was at the desk there was a long wait. The staff are friendly but there were other minor things that added up to an overall bad impression for me:
- Manager's reception was just 2 or 3 days per week
- Whatever taxi service they use when they call was very slow to arrive (20 mins+) - altough there are usually plenty of taxis there early in the morning
- The room (e.g. bathroom) could do with an update
- There is free WiFi but it seemed slow
- There was a $15 fee to handle each parcel if you have something delivered there
- Plenty of nearby restaurants but Gordon Biersch has also gone downhill since I was last there.</p><br>Terrible breakfast<p>I booked two rooms at this hotel due to its proximity to The Bellagio. Room has plenty of space and did not feel trapped. Problem(s): one front desk associate to check in several new guests. We had to wait for about 20 minutes to check in. Bathroom in our room had pubic hairs on the floor. Not good!
Second problem: on the following morning, we decided to go for their breakfast. Bad idea. The place was packed solid and not a single chair. Our only option would have been to eat out by the pool. Very poor offering of food items. I understand is a "free" breakfast, but I know that the cost is built in the room rate. The problem was that the two ladies in charge of breakfast were clearly overwhelmed by the demand and could not keep up with it. At this point, we decided to leave the property and buy our breakfast at the nearest IHOP. We did not even bother to stop by on the second morning.
We will be looking for another hotel in our next trip to Las Vegas.
Room Tip: If looking for a hotel with free breakfast, please look someplace else. This is not the place.

If you want to stay away from the strip, this is OK, but I am sure there are better ones. We stayed in the memorial weekend so everything was very expensive. The rooms are OK, with ample space, but if you are more than 4 persons in a 2-queen bed room, then it can be a tight squeeze for space. The towels were not all that great but adequate. However one soap was provided for a room taken for 4 persons. The kitchenette was OK, but the dinner plates were very small and not even an extra one from 4, So every time you eat something you have to keep on washing the dishes. The breakfast service was very poor, not much of options, but what was really bugging was the timing. It was 7 to 9:30 am; and when on vacation, it is natural for families to get up late. The hotel staff was so inconsiderate that if you even reached by 9:15, there was usually a long queue and they would remove all the food at dot 9:30. It was quite rude. The swimming pool was good and so was the gym. I would not stay here again.</p><br>Would be rated "very good" if the rooms were modern<p>I spent 4 days with family at this off strip location. The staff was friendly, hotel was clean, the included breakfast was okay and free so did the job. It is only a few minutes drive to The Strip or a 30 minute or so walk so location was fine if you are staying with small children and don't want to be in a casino or staying for business. This property also has a small pool that seemed well maintained. My only real complaint would be that the interior of the guest rooms appears it hasn't seen an update since the 90's and the mattresses seemed to be less comfy and of lower quality than other Marriott properties I have stayed in. With so many hotel choices in the area I would have thought it would be more up to date since there is so much competition and the rate isn't very low ($180ish or so per night).</p><br>Very quiet room and very clean<p>I have stayed here several times before and will do so in the future as it is only a short drive to the airport and many of the strip properties. It is also next door to several decent restaurants like McCormick & Schmick, Fogo de Chao and Bahama Breeze.

My room was on the 11th floor and faced Flamingo. Just East from here is a very busy Clark County Fire station and ambulances race all the time down Flamingo towards the strip. If I looked out the window I could see them but barely hear them. The building is well sealed and the room is very quiet.

My room was also kept very clean and the pillows and bed sheets looked new.

I can't comment on the breakfast as I didn't eat from it. Generally avoid those. I skipped the evening reception too. Weird. Most RI hotels I stay at have them Monday to Thursday. This week it was Monday and Tuesday only here. Didn't affect me though as I don't do those either but thought I would mention it.

The Internet is awful, rated at 1mb/s. it disconnected me frequently but was free. This is 2013! I would happily pay a higher room rate for better Internet.

Overall a very good non-smoking choice to stay in Vegas.</p><br>It was fine, good off-the-strip location<p>I'm not sure why there are rave reviews, though. The room was fine, a bit old, but clean, even though the carpet seemed like I shouldn't go barefoot on it. Towels are older. They pour your wine and beer for you at the evening happy hour. The breakfast is typical, but some of the better scrambled eggs we've had at a Marriott. In room kitchen is nice if you need it; and they do give you coffee and a microwave popcorn in the basket. We booked it because it was away from the Strip traffic, and very grateful to that -- but beware if you have to get to the 15 at rush hour - you still have a bit of cross traffic if you go Flamingo -- head a little farther south to get on and you'll be ok. Also, if you want to walk to the strip, it's a bit far for many, definitely so in the heat. Plenty of good, adjacent restaurants (chains, but good ones) if you don't feel like driving away. Staff was very nice. Fitness center has plenty of treadmills; great that they have dumbbells. Would stay here again.
Room Tip: My room faced main street and it was not noisy at all. There are 2 bedroom suites if you need it.

My wife called and asked, they found it. Wife flew back that very day to pick it up, everything was still in my wallet (credit cards n cash) So I just want to thank the housekeeper who found my wallet n her supervisor Michelle Pasaera. This is a very clean comfortable hotel. Nice location n love the complimentary hot breakfast.</p><br>Very comfortable stay!<p>We were in LV fri-sun, so most hotels was fully packed and rised their prices. Fortunately, we found special offer in Residence Inn. Location is ~15 minutes walking from the Strip, which was absolutely comfortable for us - place is quiet. Hotel has complimentary breakfast (good one!), free parking and wi-fi, some gym/spa facilities. Rooms are well eqipped (kitchen, sofa, bed, warderobe, working table, ironing stuff, etc). They also have free mini-business-center with 2 PC and Internet access. Very good for the comfortable trip planning. There are also Self-service laundry. In general - very good experience.</p><br>The 80s called...they want their pickled oak cabinets back<p>While serviceable and clean, this Residence Inn is in desperate need of renovations in the rooms. The lobby area has been redone in the past few years but the rooms have mostly original hard goods - whitewashed oak cabinets with doors that don't close fully, lots of almond tile and cheap counters, with only flat screen TVs as evidence that any updating has ever been done.

While the look is dated and boring, the service is also in need of a makeover. There's a "manager's reception" on Mondays, Tuesdays and off Wednesdays that serves a bland rotation of burgers, hot dogs (honestly) and tacos, with an equally bland, humorless person standing in the serving well pouring beer and wine with a tip jar oh-so-conveniently spread out in front of her. In the 45 days I stayed, I was greeted by name zero times and greeted generically by the front desk about three times. When I checked out, the service maintained its 100% indifference, not even knowing or caring if I had need for more nights at the place.

There was a time when Marriott prided itself on its core hospitality values. These days, there are no differentiating features and no compelling reasons to select this hotel over others. For about the same price, you can get a better Marriott experience at the SpringHill Suites across from the convention center. For half the price, you can get greeted almost daily by the staff at the Candlewood Suites across the street, and stay in a room that was renovated only a few months ago.</p><br>Solid, fantastic hotel!<p>I have stayed at this hotel several times for a few years now. This particular stay concerns March 15-17. This property has everything. Free breakfast, free parking, free internet, quiet hotel for those that don't wish to get caught up in the party/nightlife of Las Vegas, wonderful staff, and usually a decent room rate. If you have any business or event to attend at UNLV, this is a good place to stay, as it is just down the road on Flamingo. On another note regarding the staff, my observation is that it's the same people working there stay after stay, and the time between stays for me here run from a couple weeks to six months, so that tells me the hotel is well run from a management level. The lobby and breakfast area was recently renovated. The guest rooms, while perfectly functional, could use a facelift as well, especially the bathroom area, as I can tell that they are slowly wearing as time goes by. Nevertheless, I plan on going to Vegas next month, and guess where I plan to stay? That's right, at this hotel. This place is one solid property.</p><br></body></html>
