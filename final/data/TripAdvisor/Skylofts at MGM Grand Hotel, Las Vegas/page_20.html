<html><head><h3>Skylofts at MGM Grand Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 20</h3></head><body><br>I'm ruined to stay anywhere else probably<p>This had to be the most expensive trip I've ever taken but well worth the money for the fun and luxury I had. No where else have I experienced such outstanding service, great food, access to clubs, ability to pay for anything and everything by simply adding it to my room bill, and ease of payment with the concierge.

The one-bedroom Skyloft was huge and immaculate. It made me wonder what the three-bedroom lofts were like but they were all booked and I couldn't take a personal tour. Our personal butler met our every request and all the other staff did as well. It was so nice and unusual to be treated this way that my friends and I were lovingly joking about their service, "of course we can," and "yes, we can do that." Here is an example. One of my friends asked for a Wii dance/karaoke game to be brought and hooked up to our TV in the loft and the butler said of course, and went and obtained a separate TV and game console with 5 games to choose from and this was at about 4 a.m. in the morning after we had partied for hours at Studio 54.

The staff were so kind and conscientious that we were floored. They were always apologetic if something was taken care of immediately which was rare. I treated them with great respect and tipped well, thanking them in turn.

When and if I can afford to stay here, I will surely do it. It will be hard not to compare other hotels to this with a little less satisfaction.</p><br>Best in Vegas<p>By far the best rooms in Las Vegas.

Best features:
2 stories, floor to ceiling windows, topnotch butler service, top of the line coffee machine, waterfall spa, and remote control

Price Comparable with:
Wynn parlor suite (but don't waste your money on that)

Gets a tad hot in the summer due to the 2 story high glass window, turned the AC to max didn't help much. Other than that, no complains.

Regrets:
Not getting a ride in their Maybach they offered as their airport shuttle</p><br>Pure luxury - This is Las Vegas!<p>I have stayed at many 5 star hotels but I never had the level of luxury Skylofts can offer.

Located on top floor of MGM Grand main building accessed by Skylofts exclusive elevator, the room is not only huge (3,000 sqf = 278 sqm), but also loaded with amenities never before seen in a hotel such as B & O sound system throughout the 2 story room, multi functional touch screen tablet remote control, infinity jacuzzi with underwater mood lighting, steam room, multi streaming showerheads with rain shower, commercial grade espresso machine, pool table, walk-in closet big enough to please Lady Gaga, and so on.

I had a privilege to travel with a high roller friend of mine and everything was comped including room, Louis XIII, Johnnie Walker Blue, wine, food, and some shopping. I know it's not fair to write a review on a non-paid hotel stay. I just had to write it because it was very unique and special.

If I had to pay for $3,000 a night for a casual stay, I would probably not have done it unless I hit a jackpot in the casino, a big jackpot that is. If they offer special promo rate for my special occasion though, I would book this room again without a doubt. Wow factor comes in for special occasion for my special crowds.

Skylofts itself is pure Las Vegas where insanity can be taken as sanity on a daily basis. After all, I was much more impressed of what was going on at a high roller baccarat table where my friend was playing than this room - an absolute culture shock.</p><br>3rd stay and still exceptional<p>We have stayed at the Skylofts on 2 other occasions. My husband on at least 5 other trips. It is our hotel of choice in LV. Travelling with 2 young infants (13m and 2 years..yes, very close) this hotel was excellent. The hosekeeping supplied to wonderful cots, not travel cots but solid wooden cots with bumpers, quilts and brand new cuddly toys. There wer 2 child gates at both the top and bottom of the stairs. Two high chairs. The butler gave us baby water each day for the formula. All staff were super friendly especially towards the children. Most evenings were spent upstairs in the room which was fine as the DVD player was very useful. The 900 choice of TV channels was also great. My mum stayed a fews nights along while my husband and I went out.

We always had preferred dinning, valet parking and service. But you expect this as it goes with the price tag. As for the small entrance lobby. This is new and was only out in place the last 3 years or so. Hence it's location. Before you used to check in through the main private lounge. The parking used to also be mixed in with the other guests. As for the lift service, if there is a high security guest, there is a security guard in the private lift that only allows skyloft guests access.

We actually spent 5 days in LV then was supposed to spend 5 days in LA but cut that short and came back to the MGM after 3 days and spent other 7 days in LV.

I love this hotel especially for couple travelling but even with small kiddies it was superb. Can't wait for next time :)


Restaurants all good. Spa service and treatments great too. Laptop rental also available.</p><br>BEST HOTEL IN VEGAS!<p>First off, let me say that I am not a fan of Vegas. That being said, I took my partner there for his birthday last year to see a show at the MGM. After searching for 'the best' hotel on the strip, I found the SkyLofts and it looked too good to be true. Immediately after booking, a concierge contacted me asking about special requests etc, as the show we were seeing was at the MGM, I requested that our tickets be picked up and I mentioned that we were celebrating a birthday. We arrived at the Las Vegas airport and walked off the plane and were immediately greeted by a SkyLofts Driver. He carried our bags to the limo that was awaiting us. Unfortunately the Maybach was not available but it was still a great limo ride and a treat to be escorted from gate to limo. Upon arrival, there were 3 people waiting for us, greeting us by name as we exited the limo. We were taken to a private check in area separate from the main MGM lobby. As we arrived early, our room was not ready, so I asked if there was a good breakfast place....the concierge picked up the phone, got us a table at Mansion for breakfast, and we were escorted to the restaurant. VERY private and away from it all, awesome breakfast! Our room was ready after breakfast......escorted back to the private check in area, then whisked up the private elevators to the top floor of the MGM..elevator door opens and you are in a different world! Blue modern lighting, a very quiet zen like feeling! As we came to our door, there was a private butler with white gloves on, opening our door for us. The room is AMAAAAZING! I cannot stress that enough! HUGE, 2 level Floor to Ceiling windows, 3 flat screens, Bang and Olufson surround sound in the whole place, remote control everything...... anything you could imagine. The tickets to our show were printed out and on the table, as with a Birthday Cake! SURPRISE! Fully stocked mini bar, coffee station, snacks, huge dining room table! It was great! If you are looking for complete luxury and space and being treated like a star, this is the place! We had dinner in our room served from Craft. They came and set everything up as if we were dining downstairs! Service is top notch! DO NOT miss this place!!!!!!! Upon departure, the Maybach was available and that was our ride back to the airport..........</p><br>Skylofts.... Words Cannot express! see for yourself.<p>Let me start by saying this is THE BEST hotel I have EVER stayed.
6 months prior to planning a visit to Las Vegas I saw this hotel on trip advisor and knew this is where I would stay if I ever got to Vegas.

2 couples stayed in the 2 bedroom skylofts, initially there was some concern that the skylofts wouldnt be big enough and private enough for two couples to stay, we didnt need to worry.

The skylofts were huge, we didnt take advantage of the free maybach limo on the way in as we were getting a limo from LA. We were met at the skylobby and taken up to our loft for checkin.

everything was fabulous, we had booked into MGM signature for 3 nights after the skylofts stay followed by our final night at the planet hollywood. we decided after our original two night stay that we would change planet hollywood reservations and stay again for one extra night. The concierge organised all of this. The concierge also organised Late checkout and early check in and the Maybach for both the Skylofts check out and the Signature back to skylofts trip three days later.

The pool table we requested in the suite was great and well used.

You can read other reviews and see from photos what words cannot express, if you can stretch to afford it, you will not be disappointed!

I can say I will return here!</p><br>The Best in LV<p>The only downside is the expense. If you can afford it there is no better place to stay. Airport transfers in Maybach/Limo, complimentary snacks/drinks, VIP treatment at any nightclub/restaurant, Breakfast at the Mansion, free movies (all movies)......Need I say more.....</p><br>EXCELLENT....<p>Everything in this hotel was superb, love to be there, waanaa go again.....</p><br>The Absolute Best<p>Was at the Skylofts for 5 days with a bachelor party of 15 guys, 6 of us sleeping in the 2-bed loft. All you can say about this room was WOW. The actual room is amazing - the pool table was great for entertaining, the media room was a hit for watching movies, there was more than enough seating for my entire big group, and the bathrooms were to die for. The shower is the finest shower I've ever been in, with a rain showerhead, 4 wall-mounted jets shooting water at your chest, a European showerhead and steam jets, plus a nice cedar bench to sit on while washing your feet and being 4x the size of a normal shower. The infinity tub was nearly as nice, especially because you could turn on the bathroom's flat-screen TV to keep you amused in-tub. But what sets the Skylofts apart is the amazing service. They unpack your bags, bring up complimentary non-alcoholic drinks and ice, press your clothes, provide an extra TV for your video game systems, store your leftovers from meals and heat them up and serve them to you on request, have all the on-demand movies you want and also a significant DVD library you can borrow from, and have the best concierge you could ever imagine (got us primo spots at all the nightclubs we wanted - places that were "sold out" suddenly found room when the Skylofts concierge called on your behalf) - and thats just the complimentary stuff (and I didn't even mention the complimentary round-trip Maybach - I will never again sit in such a beautiful car). Its worth mentioning that despite all this service, it seldom felt stiff or formal. All it took was hitting the "do not disturb" button and the butlers stayed out of this room, and the staff at the desk was warm and friendly without being excessively formal.

The lofts ended up being a great venue for our party - while Skylofts policy forbids outside alcohol and food, its fair to say that if you don't flaunt that you are bringing it in you are unlikely to have a problem. It was a wonderful base of operations, the service was impeccable, the common areas were spacious and comfortable, and the sleeping areas were perfect. You obviously pay for what you get, but if you're having a large group out to Vegas then getting a Skyloft is a great call.</p><br>Sort of Dissapointing<p>The Skylofts at MGM Grand, revered as one of the best hotels in Las Vegas, certainly did not meet my expectations during my stay there.

Anticipating the stay a month earlier, we proceeded to book the Two-Bedroom loft with our host. We had a pleasant drive from Los Angeles and were extremely surprised to see the Skylofts Entrance, an extreme failure on the part of the MGM Grand. The Skyloft "Private" Entrance is merely a sliding door literally two feet from the main entrance. You literally have to drive through the hustle and bustle of the main entrance to get out of the MGM Grand. I wonder who designed this... Anyways, inside the tiny little reception room that is through the sliding doors, a receptionist is sitting at a desk, calling the concierge to escort us to our Skyloft. The Concierge arrives about fifteen minutes later and escorts us through another pair of sliding doors... right into the MGM lobby! What a sight... why did they build the tiny entrance anyways?! You have to walk through the entire lobby to get to the VIP Lounge, where you pass another pair of doors into a "Private Elevator" which isn't private at all. The Elevators can also be accessed through a pair of doors from the main elevator areas, which guests staying in the MGM Grand frequently bypass and crowd the elevators with. The Elevator is anything but grand, with the inside in a very poor condition. However, the Skylofts can only be reached using your room key, so there was a bit of security allowed. When we reached the skyloft lobby on the 29th floor, there was a pleasant scent which led to a front desk in which two people were working. We were escorted to Loft 81, our loft, next to which a bellman and butler were waiting for us. The Butler proceeded to give us a tour of the loft. She then left, and we never saw our butler for the remainder of the stay. On the dining table were two glasses with an extremely sweet concoction and a plate of cheap candies, including a bunch of nuts. We were bewildered at the size of the loft at the beginning, which had three living rooms and a game room. We thought that the loft was a waste of space, although probably good for hosting a party. It was difficult to communicate with each other throughout the loft and was very easy to forget things. The Crestron remotes were a bonus until they stopped working and the TV's had to be manually turned on. However, the beds were comfortable and the bathrooms were well appointed. However, beware of the stairs!!!!!! Older travelers and young children probably would not be comfortable in this room because of the very tall staircase. Sometimes we would come back to the room exhausted and proceed upstairs to take a shower, then remembering that we forgot something downstairs, and not even bothering to go down and fetch it. Also, the many rooms downstairs are very small and the hallways narrow. The dining room barely fit the dining room set, and it looked as if though a TV had been removed from one of the cabinets, probably for economical reasons. Anyways, the remote controlled climate and drape system worked fine and the Bang and Olufsen gadgets were nice. However, from a $1000+/night room, you would expect the best technology, but instead, very poor quality Sony Televisions were provided, which constantly were very fuzzed up. One good feature though was that every room had a DVD player. Other nice features were that the non-alcoholic drinks, snacks, and movies were complimentary. Also, internet access was free. I found the steam room quite useful and the tub average, some may appreciate the lights, but I would have preferred a jet tub, instead of a champagne bubble function. They still provide a flower with a quote at turn down service and also provide a glass of voss water beside the bed. However, the overall design and amenities of the Skylofts did not suit us, and we proceeded to move to the Wynn.</p><br></body></html>
