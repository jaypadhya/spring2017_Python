<html><head><h3>Skylofts at MGM Grand Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 14</h3></head><body><br>Worth every penny...<p>Stayed in a 2 bedroom loft (not the one with the balcony) for 3 nights in March. What an experience.

They have a driver waiting for you by baggage claim with your name on an ipad (cute) and he will take your luggage into the ROLLS ROYCE GHOST limo. Talk about arriving in style. it was amazing.

The room itself is incredible. I looked at dozens of pictures and even a youtube video tour of the room, but it doesn't really do it justice. You have to see it to believe it.

Now, I booked with American Express FHR (fine hotels & resorts) which is a fantastic deal. I highly recommend booking through there if you can. They upgrade you to a stripview room, which is way nicer and it has the pool table instead of the foosball table (at least the room we had did). One caveat about fhr is they promise a $50 per day credit for in-room dining, but it actually is just a daily continental breakfast which is pretty bare-bones. Still, it's free you get one free for every bedroom (so 2 every morning in my case). Fhr also gets you late checkout (4 pm) and a 100 credit towards the spa.

The skyloft service is impeccable and they responded to every request pretty instantly. The whole butler thing is really just a marketing thing because we didn't see out butler after the initial visit, and there's no need to call the "butler" anyway when you have the regular concierge willing to do everything. The skylofts have dedicated people just for their rooms which is awesome.

Another advantage, which can be a really big deal sometimes is you do not have to wait in line for a cab. At some points, the lines waiting for cabs stretched out probably 100 feet. Probably a good 20-30 minute wait. But the concierge at the skyloft portion get priority and never have to wait. That was a time-saving benefit.

I've read a few reviews complaining about the maid service and how they just walk in without warning. Did not experience that AT ALL. The staff was always courteous and there is a "do not disturb" option in the room that everyone respects.

The room is totally automated (lights, music, thermostat, blinds) and there is a separate remote for each area.

Overall, a fantastic experience and will definitely be back!
Room Tip: Get a strip-view room if you can, those are the ones with the pool tables (instead of foosball)

It also has a secret luxury surprise that is sort of like tropical awesomeness. Cool yo yoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyo!,,,,,,,!!!!!!a,!!,!,</p><br>Expensive, but well worth the price<p>We stayed for a night only in the 1 bedroom sky loft. While the price is high compared to other properties around the world of this type, the service alone was worth the price. After being picked up in the stretch Rolls, we were whisked up via a private entrance to our Sky Loft for check in. The room has amazing features none more so than the best bathroom we have ever seen. The huge bathroom comes with an incredible rain shower as well as a steam room all built into one. My wife could have spent the whole night in there!

The service of the butlers is brilliant and our special treat of breakfast at Mansions was well worth the price. The concierge David was also fantastic and took care of all our special requests prior to arrival. A fantastic stay and we would highly recommend it to anyone wanting to try something very special.</p><br>A mixed bag<p>I don't normally write reviews but thought I must at least put one in here to acknowledge some of the people that made our trip fun!!

Rooms - the rooms are absolutely fantastic. I don't think you could find a better room in Vegas. We had two two bedroom suites across the hall from each other. The only complaint I had was that some of the electronics in the rooms just didn't work specifically the iPod player but then there were enough other options to take care of that - including an in house song library.

Service - I will split this into two parts:

Butlers - a bit hit and miss depending on whom you got but I thought Joe Bompartito was outstanding. Eventually we were all in agreement that he could at least be left alone and we knew that what we wanted would get done. He also went above and beyond to get a few details sorted for us that most people had failed with earlier. Something I expect from an establishment like this. A pat on the back to Michael as well who we worked very hard with some demanding requests in the evening.

Other hotel staff - we booked through an agent and had a disagreement on what we were entitled to get vs. what we got. However, as I had in writing everything we had been promised, it made things easier. Again thank you to Mark and Joe who followed up and had this sorted out. The fact that I had to discuss this numerous times despite all the arrangements being made well in advance irritated me and took some of the enjoyment out of the trip. Every one we spoke to gave us different answer on the facilities. However, it was all sorted out eventually to our satisfaction.

Transportation - the limo ride to and from the airport was great. The Ghost on the way in was great but on the way out we got a suburban...not that it made much of a difference but we didn't get an apology just got told that the Ghost was dependent on availability.

If you are thinking of using the hotel to get you limos - don't. They are vastly overpriced and use and outsourced service. When I asked what I was being charged, they told me that they didn't know and I should check my credit card statement. The least I would expect when you hand over my card details to somebody that you tell me how much is being charged to it.

Others:

1) The separate entrance is just a set of doors only good if you want to skip the large taxi queue at the main entrance. You still have to walk through the lobby and the throngs of people to get to the elevators

2) check in - worked smoothly for 3 out of the 4 including in-room check in. I got in last and had to wait for 20 mins in the lobby waiting for a concierge to take me to my room who never showed up. The excuse I got was they didn't know I was arriving then but I had clearly heard the chauffeur call on the way to let them know I was arriving. Eventually, I made my way to the room on my own but the person on the desk didn't even offer to take me to the lifts - all of a 5 min affair if she bothered to get off the desk.

3) we had a club booking on the Friday night and asked for a limo to drop us off. It suddenly became this huge problem and we were told we would have to wait 40 mins to get one. It took about 3 phone calls to get this information. We eventually just got sick of it and took a cab.

This is a long review but overall I would say it was a good experience but not great. The room and Joe swings it to 4 on 5. Otherwise I would say a 3.
Room Tip: Make sure you get a strip facing loft otherwise you have a view of a car park...

I never expected such a nice place and can easily see how it made it as one of the top hotels of the world!</p><br>lap of luxury<p>It doesn't get better then this. amazing view, HUGE room, a shower room (like 6 shower heads) and a bathtub that never over flows. Staff is wonderful. Anything we wanted was delivered promply. The only problem we had was room service messing up and order. They immediatley replaced it with the correct one and brought a few extra goodies. an incredible time.

This is the way to go high end!</p><br>The Best Keep Secret In Las Vegas<p>I have to assume anyone that gives this place less than 5/5 is trying to stop the secret from getting out: Skylofts is the top of the mountain.

I have stayed here four times in the last four years and each time is as perfect as the last. I will be staying a fifth time in June. The quality of this hotel in every aspect is uncontested. I am in perpetual awe. From the seamless airport pick up to the timely airport drop off, everything in between is flawless. I am truly made to feel like royalty. I am not sure how, but every person on staff knows my name and my guests names on sight, no matter the hour. The butlers, Leroy and Igor, whom i started requesting after my first trip are attentive and friendly. The hotel seemingly spares no reasonable request.

On one trip, my boys had spent the entire day traveling, got in late, and did not want to change out of their traveling clothes (for all intents and purposes pajamas) before going out to a club at the hotel. I called the concierge and explained to him the situation. 15 minutes later, we were being escorted to the club by the concierge and shuffled right in with no issue. And this level of service occurred on a trip in which there had been a error while i was booking and the decimal was placed too far to the left so i effectively paid 10% of the correct rate. Not only was the rate honored, the service was precisely what i would have expected paying 10x as much.

Because the hotel is small with only 51 rooms, the staff is able to properly discern the best way to interact with you being neither too formal nor too casual with me. And this is important to me. I was there for New Years Eve and informed the staff that i would be using the alias "general knight" for the last half of my stay. We laughed but they obliged and when i arrived with some friends to watch the fire works hours later that evening my party and i were greeted with two staff members standing up and "Happy New Years General Knight". And the following morning the morning shift had been notified of my name change. This is what real personalized service is all about. The details. And on the last night of that trip i found a hand written card along with a swarovski pen set thanking me for spending the holidays there. The details.

I took my brother for his 21st birthday last May and there was a complimentary personalized birthday cake waiting for us in the room when we checked in. He and his friends woke up early the next morning at said to me "i thought it was only like this in the movies."

I was going to expand my horizons and test the waters with a villa at another location this June. I emailed the other hotel on Friday, they failed to respond until Monday and by that time i had booked my room at skylofts and received two emails inquiring about any requests i may have. Sorry for flirting skylofts, it will never happen again. I honestly cannot say enough good things about this property. I actually finding myself taking less trips to Las Vegas now because i cannot imagine staying somewhere else.

Oh and for the record, i am not a celebrity nor am I high roller in the loosest of terms. But you would never know it because the Skylofts makes me feel like i am Jay-Z or Warren Buffet every single time. I have no doubt in my mind that June will be any different.

ps. Go to "The Mansion" for breakfast, it really doesnt get any better.</p><br>Nothing but class<p>Stayed in a one bedroom loft simply awesome. Best steam shower, coffee maker, bathtub ever come across in any of my hotel stays. The driver waiting for you at the arrivals with your name on an iPad is only the beginning of a great stay!</p><br>Dreadful, rude and inefficient place- do not stay here<p>Maybe one of the worst hotels I've ever stayed in. There was none of the cheerful American attitude I'm so used to. It started with an hour to check in with the VIP conceirge as they had not booked the correct rooms. Then half our group has not been given working room cards so everyone bunked in my space for another hour. Then the shower taps came off and the bathroom started to flood. The staff weren't too interested and I had to get a fellow holiday maker to come and help me stem the flow. After being given the card to another room, we were informed that they were not able to help me carry my things. By the time I was settled, I had missed my group dinner so ordered room service which was terrible. 2 of our group were denied room service the entire trip. I complained and was screamed at. The entire stay continued like this. In 5 days our room was cleaned once. We spent a fortune- 9 rooms and a mansion and were told on check out day I had to leave immediately or we would pay another day. Trying to extend was also a nightmare- on hold for nearly an hour and put through to our 'personal conceirge' who answer his phone with an 'hello, hello' and then put the phone down and said I don't know who u are. I explained I needed 5 mins. They sent someone up and my friend and I complained about the service. She told us she was happy to have security to escort us out if we didn't like it!! Other fiascos were repeatedly mis-booked limos which we were charged for and another missed dinner due to lateness and a bad smell in all the rooms. A truly dreadful experience and I'm just so lucky for this not have been my first Vegas.</p><br>Very Good, but not Great<p>Visit = Feb. 4th to 7th, 2013. I believe the skyloft at MGM Grand is in need of some staff training, they must have a lot of new people on the floor. Arrived on the 4th, greeted at the valet parking area, taken to my room to register. Love that feature, no need to stand in line at the VIP lounge. 1st day was great. On the 2nd day, I noticed the lid on the espresso machine was broken, the dining room table had crumbs on it, coffee bean containers were no re-stocked and there was white stuff floating in the espresso machine water tank. This was after they had cleaned the room. Did not receive my turn-down treats neither on the 5th nor the 6th. Finally, I asked the front desk to check me in on my flight since I was going out for supper and asked her to change my seat to an aisle seat if it wasn't already assigned. When I got back from supper, she told me that it was all done and I had my aisle seat. Ride to the airport was great in the Rolls Royce, however my boarding pass had me sitting near the window. Couldn't she see from the airplane diagram when she chose the seat? Other than the above, the rest was great.</p><br></body></html>
