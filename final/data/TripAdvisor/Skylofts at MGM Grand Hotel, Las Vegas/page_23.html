<html><head><h3>Skylofts at MGM Grand Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 23</h3></head><body><br>The Most Ridiculous Hotel in Vegas - And Thats Hard To Do!!!<p>Check in goes like this:

We flew from LAX with just carry ons. Coming down the escalator an MGM man is there waiting for us. He escorts us outside where our limo driver is waiting. The car is a Maybach (a $200k+ Mercedes sedan). A short drive from the airport to the MGM and we pull past the long line of cars waiting for a check in. Another man in a suit opens my door, he knows my name and introduces himself and 2 other men take my luggage from the car. We walk into the MGM lobby past the check in lines to the VIP check-in room. But we don't stop there. We walk right through the room, past the "normal" VIP's at their private desks and go onto an elevator just for the skylofts. Once up on the top floor we are in yet another lobby with 2 staff at a large desk. We keep walking. They both greet us by name as we pass by. At the end of the hallway I see a woman waiting holding a door open. Of course its my room. We walk right in, so now its me, my wife, the concierege guy who opened the car, two men with our luggage and the door holding woman. Waiting on the dining room table is a portfolio with our room confirmation and a printed itinerary of our dinner plans that i had made in advance and confirmation for VIP seating at a few MGM clubs for the weekend. We sign the paper and most of the staff cordially depart. The door woman now gives a long tour of the two floor hotel room. Tada- you're checked in.

That pretty much sums up the over-the-top so incredible its practically invasive level of service at the SkyLofts. Its an incredible property. We only had two complaints 1- the steam shower works so well that the bedroom smells like mold. 2- you MUST use the do-not-disturb signs because the staff comes in SO often you feel like you have houseguests. Staff walked into the bathroom with my wife in the shower. The walked into the living room while i was in the downstairs bathroom. Twice they came in the morning while we were sleeping. Use the do-not-disturb light. Apparently its there for a reason. An example: Your in-room berries are refreshed twice daily.

The Lofts dont have their own pool or amenties like The Mansion at MGM but they will allow you to dine at The Mansion if you are a Lofts guest if you ask. We had breakfast there which was sort of neat because most people arent even aware it exists.

The lofts are huge and consequently are frequently rented to groups of "6" young men for parties. That of course means 32 young men and all the women they could find at the clubs. They aren't loud, but they definately are quiet. Most of the times you dont see anyone in the elevators or halls, but when you do its typically 10 very drunk people. Viva Las Vegas.

Its fun.</p><br>It was once excellent...not so much now<p>I have stayed at the SkyLofts twice in the past year. Had I written a review of my first experience, I probably would have given it 5 stars. However, after my most recent experience I am going to rate it at 3. There was such a laundry list of issues with the room and other aspects that I cant possibly give it anything higher.

Problems:
-Despite multiple confirmations in person and over the phone, they had no record of any request to pick up the 2nd half of the group at the airport, and they ended up wasting an hour waiting for pickup
-Despite 4 different complaints throughout the weekend, the air conditioning never worked and the room stayed at a temp of around 80 the entire time.
-2 of the different sound systems in the suite were completely blown out
-The shower in the master bedroom was totally disfunctional. The temperature gauge was useless and 2 of the handles were completely broken off.
-4 of us were stuck in the elevator for 5 minutes, continuously ringing the alarm. After no one checked on us, we physically pried open the doors and climbed out.

I don't know if this is because of the troubled economy or what, but the room was in terrible physical shape and the service, although still pretty good, was much worse than before. I would still recommend this place but ONLY if you can get a really good deal on one of the rooms. If you're considering spending any more than $1500 on a 2 bedroom loft, I would go somewhere else. Also, it is located at the MGM, which is a major downside as it is just terrible when compared to the newer places such as The Wynn, Venetian, Bellagio, etc.</p><br>Truly Outstanding Five-Star Experience - Despite the<p>My partner and I had decided to head down to Vegas to get hitched, and to make the experience a memorable one, after reading all the positive feedback on the Skylofts we thought we'd give them a go.

From the moment we stepped off the pane and were met by our personal customer service rep, to when we sank back into the luxurious leather seats of the $450,000 Maybach 62 courtesy transfer limousine - I knew we were in for a treat. These guys actually GET service (maybe a little too much).

We were greeted at the hotel by our personal concierge, who introduced us to the myriad of staff who would be looking after us during our stay - butler, facilities, etc. It was slightly daunting at first, but we quickly got over that.

The Skylofts are more expensive than most of the top level rooms on the strip, but are definitely worth it. They are 2 x level luxury apartments with a separate lounge/dining/study level with great views of the strip.

Something as simple as room service is a truly wonderful experience - with staff taking time to set up the whole meal at your dining table every time - true in room dining.

The spa and steam room, combined with the Bvlgari bath products make bathing an even more pleasurable experience.

The only negatives we could find were that the air-conditioning in the rooms is very dry. We would regularly wake up in the morning extremely dehydrated and turning it off was not really an option.

The other slightly negative comment related to tipping. I'm aware that tipping is the norm in the US, and ordinarily I don't have an issue with this. But as we had encountered at least 5 x staff before even getting to our room (limo driver, concierge, butler, porter, etc), combined with all the others during our stay, we found ourselves constantly tipping staff.

I also agree with oscar2405's comments about lack of privacy. Being a regular hotel stayer i've gotten into the habit of dead-locking the door every time i'm in a room - this is due to the experience of staff entering the room (at all hours) without your authority. I found that at Skylofts the staff would knock/ring the bell and enter before you had a chance to actually get to the door to open it. If you were in the shower or napping, they would end up calling you to get you to open the door - which was annoying.

The other thing that surprised us was the actual MGM lobby/casino. Rowdy, intoxicated, shirtless teenagers, and people milling around (sitting on the floor) the lobby were a regular sight. Combined with the stinking smoke filled casino, full of people wearing bathers made us wonder if we were actually staying at a 5-star hotel or a Club Med resort - no wonder they have a private entrance/check in for Skyloft guests.</p><br>Skylofts is Heaven on Earth<p>There are some hotels in the world that have a very devout following. Even staying one night at the Skylofts, one understands this concept very well. After being a guest at the Skylofts you understand what it means to be pampered and attended to is like. The entire experience is truly luxurious.
After making reservations, I was contacted the next day regarding my pickup information and my personal preferences for soft drinks, coffees, juices or other assistance with dining or show reservations.
There was a slight glitch with the pickup service but it was handled very professionally and gracefully. We were picked up in the MGM limo due to other pickups but the Mayback would have been nicer. We were greeted curbside by a Concierge and our personal bellman and shown to the new (since Jan ’09) Skylobby adjacent to the MGM main lobby area. It is a small registration area staffed with a 24hr Concierge and Ambassador who will arrange for transportation (ie private taxi line). I think after a few complaints the MGM built the separate Skylobby to compete with the exclusive hotels-within-hotels trend. I appreciate that alot: a hotel that listens. Prior to the Skylobby, guests of the Skylofts had to wait in the same lines as guests of the MGM for taxis. Not exactly optimal if you’re paying upwards of $500/night.
We were whisked through the VIP Lounge to the private elevators of the Skylofts. Already waiting for us outside our Loft was our Butler and Bellman with our luggage in tow. “Sign here,” and our keys were handed to us. My favorite drink, watermelon juice, was waiting for us on the dining table as well as an icy Dr Pepper for my partner. I actually think they remembered how much I loved watermelon juice from my previous stay. Amazing. We were shown the multitude of gadgets and endless features of the Loft: Jura Espresso Machine, Kohler Infinity Edge Bubble Jet tub, Sony TV, B & O sound systems, and Crestron Controls for lighting, drapes, climate, and electronics. Then you are left in peace so you can, as another reviewer stated, to pick your jaw up from the floor.
There are endless rooms that continue to go on and on. The two bedroom consisted of three living areas, three dining areas, powder bath, and gameroom with a fooseball table. Upstairs, one bedroom with King bed and another bedroom with two Queen beds each with private baths that including the Infinity tub, Steam Shower with multiple body sprays and rainshowers, toilets with bidets and closets as big as some New York City hotel rooms.
The Skylofts have complimentary internet access throughout and On-Demand movies, yes even those movies.... Your loft is always refreshed with your favorite non-alcoholic beverages and some light refreshements twice daily.
This is the type of establishment where staff stand up when you walk off the elevator, step aside in the hallway, and address you always by last name. But never at anytime did it ever feel stuffy or overbearing. We just felt tended to.
I must mention the housekeeping and turndown service are exemplary. The Lofts are kept spotless. Our turndown service was beyond slippers beside the bed and chocolate on the pillows. Our toiletries we brought with us were laid out neatly on the vanity, my toothbrush was tucked into its own linen napkin, the clothes strewn across the chaise were neatly hung in the closet, shoes laid out in a perfect row, the Kleenexes were embossed with the Skylofts logo, and our sunglasses placed on yet another linen napkin. And Voss water with glass next to the bed on, you guessed it, another linen napkin. Awesome.
We ordered room service breakfast for 8:00 am delivery. At exactly 8:00 we came downstairs to the main dining table and breakfast was served. Not the standard issue cart or tray room service but fully laid out china and silverware, restaurant quality dining service for two.
This is not merely a hotel. It is an experience. A total sensory overload and a pure only-in-Vegas decadence.</p><br>Perfect, Almost<p>My wife and I stayed at the MGM Skylofts June 7-11th. The Skylofts really are in a class by themselves. The service is really what sets them apart from other high end Vegas Suites.
I have stayed at the Wynn Salon and Parlor Suites, both are very very nice but the Skylofts have them beat. Only at the Skylofts can you wake up to breakfast waiting at your in suite dining table and the Butler (yes I said Butler) is making your Latte. The Butler is not your full-time private butler it is one of a pool assigned to the Skyloft suites. Therefor should you want him/her in suite making your latte at 8am promptly you need to make your request in advance. That being said if you decide at 8am that you want a latte it's pretty safe to assume the butler will be there making it within 5 minutes of calling the concierge.
Anytime you walk through the Skylofts lobby any employee sitting will stand and greet you and any employee standing will move aside greet you and humbly wait for you to walk by. With one exception, one of the staff will race to the elevator to press the call button for you, pretty easy to get accustomed to.
I booked through Amex FHR for roughly the same price as the Wynns parlor suite(mid week). I was upgraded from a one to two bedroom Skyloft suite. It included Free wirless internet, Free continental breakfast, all the non-alcoholic beverages you can drink, free limo to and from the airpot and $100 spa credit. If you add up all the extras you really are getting a big bang for your buck
If you are going as a couple (just two people) don't bother getting the two suite upgrade unless you plan to have a party in your suite. The two bedroom suite was so large (3000 square feet) that we rarely even ventured into the other side.
So by now you're asking why does the title of my review say "Almost Perfect" Here's why, a few of my small request did not happen immediately and I had to reiterate my request. The staff apologized and promptly took care of the requests but that would never happen at the Mandarin Oriental in Tokyo the only place I have received better service than the Skylofts.
In conclusion unless you are a Casino Whale there is no better suite or no better service that you will get anywhere else in Vegas. Do yourself a favor, stop researching Vegas Suites and book the Skylofts nothing else compares.</p><br>Nice Hotel, but overbearing tip seeking staff and no respect for privacy<p>We were in Las Vegas to celebrate our 10th wedding anniversary and my 40th birthday. So after staying on the north end of the strip for three nights at the Encore in the Tower suite section we then headed down to the Skylofts for 2 more nights.

Firstly all our bookings were done direct with the hotel well in advance of our trip from Australia. We received excellent service from Valerie, the event concierge service that is on offer once you make a booking. Valerie assisted us with all of our bookings for restaurants, activities and show (L'atelier, The Mansion) plus multiple services at the day spa for my wife and golf for myself at Shadow Creek.. Best person we dealt with for our stay, everything was spot on as requested.

The services from all of these areas mentioned above was excellent. Best golf course I have played on anywhere in the world to date and my caddy Ryan was excellent. Ok it did cost me US$650 including tips for the round that included private maybach car transfers, club hire, buggy and drinks but hey you only turn 40 once. Great memories and played good golf which added to the day.

Now as for our stay we left with mixed feelings mainly to do with the staff rather than the ammenities on offer. Yes the rooms are very nice and large mezzanine style apartments with high end finishes and great views etc. The previous reviews have mentioned all of the gadgets and tvs, baths, automated accessories etc. So no issues here - very nice set up and the space is great even when you have come from a bigger than normal hotel suite.

The room in places was however a little worn, the limestone flooring was chipped and discoloured in places, the timber boards of the landing on the stairs warped and split, the carpet, walkways and lounge suite also showed signs of guest wear and tear. The decor is nothing offensive nor cutting edge however the 2 storey window view of the strip etc was incredible. The decorated cake, box of chocolates and fresh juice on arrival was a very personal touch for our stay.

The steam room shower was excellent although the negative egde spa looks great is was not comfortable nor was the bubble pattern adjustable to a more vigorous setting. Imagine sitting in a half flat bottle of soft drink, yes you know there are bubbles but they aren't really doing much to your senses. The Bvlgari bath products provided were exquisite.

During our stay we needed some laundry done as we were short of clothes due to the warm Las Vegas weather and the disgusting smell of cigarette smoke throughout the various casinos. So we had our butler organise this for us. Should have known better and this proved not a wise move - $160 just for the washing plus butler tip on top as well. Our small amount of washing was beautifully clean and individually folded and wrapped.

So what about the staff you ask? Check in was fine the Maybach driver collected us from Encore and we were handed over to a concierge person, then a check in counter person then on to our room butler, plus a visit from the bag person as well. Of course other than the reservation attendants everyone else stands around waiting for tips. So you tip and go with the flow.

2. Housekeeping comes twice a day and take an eternity to do their thing, mind you there are two of them working the room and of course they make sure they come and say hello and collect their tip.
OK I know in the US tipping is the norm but at some point the fee you pay to stay in a hotel should be sufficient for staff to be paid a decent income for their employment) in this instance where is my $900 p/n going if the cleaners are both standing there waiting for a tip?) don't forget the tip for the ice delivery, the room service,( even though they already add gratuity + a service fee to the bill), room butler, car driver the list never ends, oh and the butler to escort you to breakfast at the Mansion.

You cannot move about the place without someone wanting to "latch" on and do this or do that. I appreciate its a fine line between service and over servicing guests, but after a while it does get annoying as we felt there was no privacy in or out of the room. We might as well have had a revolving door for the myriad of staff who come and go as they please. If guests want assistance they will ask and no doubt the Skylofts staff will deliver, but, otherwise give guests the privacy they deserve!

On the second night, turn down service took 20 minutes and a third person / manager was in attendance the whole time as well. My pet hate throughout our stay was the continuously ignored privacy sign on the door. Staff would ring the door bell then proceed to opening the door and entering the room. I spoke with the concierge / service desk to ask them for privacy and even this failed. I went to golf and my wife wanted a spa bath so I politely asked them not to have anyone enter the room. No problem I was assured, so 15 minutes after me leaving, my wife answered the phone from the spa only to find a man from housekeeping at the door wanting to come into the room to store our laundry. Hell does anyone here understand what Do Not Disturb means? (PS there is a huge glass panel between the bath and the stairwell so there is certainly no privacy from unwanted guests or hotel staff.).

3. Everytime we left our room or came out of the lifts and passed the service staff desk they all stood up to attention. A very nice gesture but totally unwarranted and despite our requests for them not to stand up they continued this throughout our stay.

Look we are just normal people trying to enjoy our time away. Skylofts may have a high end hotel but not all guests want to overtly flash there wealth position or act like pretentious wannabes or upper crusted higher than thou types who demand everything and anything. Some people just like to be humble and private rather than in your face. Skylofts obviously has fewer guests in the humble category and more of the demanding style clientele as they are well geared for this latter style customer.

As a side note Skylofts hotel area is in the top 2 floors of the MGM Grand. It is very private and quiet unlike the general MGM casino below it. At the time of our stay it was coming up to memorial weekend as well as a big fight night in their show room so the general casino area was very busy. The casino was filled with people from all walks of life as well as the smoke from the millions of cigarattes they bring with them. The general casino is dated and and we felt sorry for the staff working in these conditions and with the numerous intoxicated and obnoxious patrons they are forced to deal with. Now as a Skylofts guest you need to go through the general hotel lift well area to get to the designated Skylofts lifts door. To do this you must work your way through the crowded waiting masses who think you are trying to push in for a limited spot in their lift. So you are in fact running the gauntlet of the gatherings of loud and intoxicated masses - not an experience for the faint hearted.

It was an indifferent experience at Skylofts, brilliant in so many areas but then mixed with some basic areas, along with some instances that were either lacking or just down right annoying. Not sure we would rush back to Skylofts or the MGM Grand.

Thanks to those staff that did listen and help us during our stay.</p><br>The Ultimate Indulgence<p>Spent 7 nights with my fiancee in the Skylofts, nothing was left to be desired, from the VIP Check-In to the Maybach transfers..

You have to experience it to believe it...</p><br>best hotel in vegas<p>The Skylofts at MGM Grand is truely an exceptional boutique hotel. I have stayed at almost every large resort on the strip, and this hotel beats them all, but it comes at a price. We were fortunate to get a decent nightly rate, which helped me justify the cost. My advice is to keep checking the hotels website for cheaper rates. I booked about seven weeks prior to traveling, and the rate dropped two times before we left, and everytime I called, they changed the rate for me with no problems.

A day after making my reservation, a hotel conceirge representative e-mailed me wanting to know if I need any help with reservations. I did and she made me show and dinner reservations. I highly recommend Craftsteak at the MGM, excellent steak and service. The conceirge informed me they would have someone meet me at the airport and bring me to the hotel.

Upon arriving in Vegas, my wife and I stepped off the plane, and there was a gentleman standing there with our name on a sign. We introduced ourselves and he escorted us to baggage claim to retreive our luggage. I was under the impression, there would be someone standing in baggage claim waiting for us, but to have someone standing outside the gate, in the terminal, we honestly felt like a VIP. We found our luggage and were wisked away in a Maybach limo, which was an awesome experience.

After check-in, we were escorted to our room, where we met our butler, who gave us a tour of our one bedroom loft. The downstairs has a living room with a couch, two chairs and tv. There is a study area which has a fax machine, telephone and free wifi. There is a half bath and a dining room area, with a nice long table, which has a wet bar, and mini fridge, stocked with water, soft drinks, and beer. All of the soft drinks and bottled water are free.

Upstairs in the loft, is the bedroom and bathroom. The bathroom is unique. A nice infinity edge bathtub, complete with whirlool, which has a flat screen tv in front of you. The shower has a rain shower head, and sauna, which I found completely relaxing. The last cool feature of the bathroom is that there is a tv in the mirror, very cool.

All of the lights, tv, air conditioning, and shades are controlled by a universal remote. You can literally be laying in bed, and turn the TV on, turn the lights off, and close the shades with a touch of a few buttons. I first read about this and thought i would find it confusing, but its quite easy to operate.

The service is first class. There is a conceirge desk in the lobby. There was always someone there, and ready to assist us if we need anything. This is a five diamond hotel and they certainly deserve the ranking.

Lastly, I have stayed at Paris, New York New York, Mandalay Bay, The Hotel at Mandalay Bay, Wynn, and the Mirage, and I am sure none of these or any other can compare to the Skylofts. If you are looking to splurge for a few days, then this is the hotel for you.</p><br>Value for $$$$$<p>Yep. Depending on how you look at it, you can really get your money's worth out of this place. I think the lowest rates they do are at around $500 a night. Expensive - yes. But I go to Vegas a lot and just wanted a place at the MGM to chill in out without the rest of the sightseeing marathon.

But for $500 you get an AMAZING 2 floor penthouse, roundtrip limo or Maybach transfers, free gym access (they have a small gym up there or you can use the main MGM gym), all the free soft drinks/water/coffee/tea you can guzzle, free internet, free in room movies (including the adult stuff.....), enough Bulgari bath products to last you a life time. There's probably a lot more stuff that you get included.

I stay at the Wynn/Encore a lot where in just a regular sized room they charge you at least $8 for water, $15 per day for internet, $13 per movie, $30 for use of the gym - and if you want a car to pick you up at the airport, its gonna cost. You do the math on how much extra you spend for an average sized hotel room elsewhere.

I can't imagine there are many other hotels as good as this in America - and if they are, they're not going to be anywhere near as good value for money. Yes, $500 is a lot per night. But there is a lot of value in it for a high end experience. Stay here at least once and don't leave for the entire trip. Also make sure you get breakfast at The Mansion. Unless you're a serious high-roller, there's no other way to get into that place. And it is stunning.

Staff can be a little over bearing though. Butlers and maids coming throughout the day probably expect to be tipped a little more than usual.</p><br>Amazing<p>Just returned from a few day visit at skyloft/las vegas. It is a different world from the rest of the las vegas hotels. The rooms are 2 large floors which are tastefully decorated- no gold carpet- gigantic shower, bathroom, closet, great sound system bring your ipod - I only wish I could live at home in something so big. Check in took 2 minutes and express elevator takes you right to the floor. Quiet rooms - you won't hear anyone coming down the hall late at night. There are people to help you everywhere and every second- need a reservation no problem, don't know where the health club is they will walk you there, the butler will unpack your suitcase, need breakfast at 5 am its there, as well as pick up from the airport. The room is stocked with water, soda which is good since las vegas water tastes awful. The staff is so friendly and nice. The down side is the price of course, whether its worth the money is up to you, for me it was a special occasion- the other is that in comparison to skylofts the rest of the mgm hotel feels sort of trashy and the pool area is nothing special- no special pool service for skylofts- they definitely need their own pool. But for amazing service and accommodations nothing can beat this place. You will certainly wow whoever you bring .</p><br></body></html>
