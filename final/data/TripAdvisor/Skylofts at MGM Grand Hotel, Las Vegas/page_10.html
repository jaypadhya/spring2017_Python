A friend had casino comps at a penthouse of another hotel and convinced us to stay in a 2 Bedroom there. After the first night, we realized that it "just wasn't the same as Skylofts" and we wanted to switch. All it took was 1 phone call and Skylofts had the Rolls Royce on the way to pick us up. Room was ready, butlers were ready and we were "home again" in the BEST hotel in Vegas (maybe anywhere).

Stay was 100% perfect from start to finish, amazing room, great hospitality, and truly royal treatment. They even went so far as to stock the fridge with a soft drink that they don't normal carry because one of our friends was craving regular Dr. Pepper. GREAT WORK Team Skylofts. We'll see you again...can't wait until next time!</p><br>Lack of communication and Service<p>Spent two nights in the Skylofts. There was lack of communication from the beginning when the room was booked. Concierge never contact me for airline pick up info. When I contacted the concierge to give my flight info with three simple request

1. stripview
2. use of Rolls Royce for airline pick up or drop off
3. snacks on arrival

none of the request was full-filled.</p><br>Exceeded all my expectations<p>From pick up at the airport to being dropped off at the airport, the treatment we received was nothing short of exceptional. The room was top of the line luxurious, high tech and very easy to function.
The staff went out their way to accomodate tickets, reservations, late check out...pretty much anything we requested.
Worth every penny! I highly recommend the skylofts at the MGM.</p><br>Fantastic Once Again<p>Recently spent four great nights in the Skylofts. The staff is what makes this place so special. I enquired about tickets to a basketball game and was told it was sold out. Game night I was contacted and told some tickets had become available. I was able to sit court side. Special thanks to Aldene Espino and Paul Cieslewicz. This place spoils you and makes it very difficult to stay anywhere else. I will be back.</p><br>Yet another awesome trip<p>Alright, I had to give in and make another trip to SkyLofts. I will start with the "needs improvement" suggestions: Booked thru AMEX FHR received email letter stating Pre-Arrival concierge would contact me within 72 hours for airline info for pick-up...that contact was never initiated and I called SkyLofts a week later to provide info. Not an issue, but if you aren't going to contact, don't send the letter. Water pressure in shower in Loft 12 should be looked at (this is a re-occuring theme with me at this property. When I first stayed when they first opened, shower water pressure was over-the-top.) Now on to the accolades.....As I have written before on previous visits, the employees that work at this hotel are about as good as they come. As I was deplaning, Lina from SkyLofts called my cell explaining she would be waiting at baggage claim carousel to drive me to the hotel. Upon meeting, Lina was most pleasant and professional. Concierge and Butler were both great. I waited last minute and asked if I could get into Latellier for Friday night. Concierge explained they were 'fully committed' and apologized...more my lack of planning than anything else. On Saturday afternoon concierge calls and says she can get me into the restaurant later that evening. This is the epitome of service. The majority of the staff go above and beyond. Housekeeping/Turndown are fantastic. I can't wait for my next visit.</p><br>Amazing!<p>I have stayed in quite a few suites in vegas and this one is definitely in the top 3. The shower is by far and away the most amazing thing. Nice room....a closet for 5 people... tv's are a little small for the size of the room but the quality of everything else makes up for that. The butler service is very nice and down to earth people. Well worth the $$... My wife used the salon and had her nails done and loved it too.</p><br>Could not have been any better<p>As the title suggests this place is the best.

I have never experienced this level of service in my life. The staff at skylofts (all of them that we encountered) were extremely pleasant. You feel like a celebrity, but they are not so much in your face that it is annoying. From the rolls royce pickup at the airport to the complimentary pressing service, everything is done very smoothly and without hassle.

We decided to change our departure flight last minute to an earlier flight (the girlfriend was not feeling well). Within minutes of notifying the concierge of our change, we were given new transportation arrangements (still in the rolls) and our bags were hurried down so that we could make our flight on time. We didn't have to touch our bags from leaving the room until arriving back home at the airport. These guys know how to take the stress out of vacation and truly provide a wonderful experience.

So if you're willing to pay for this level of service, you will be happily rewarded.

p.s. Make sure you take advantage of dining at the Mansion!
Room Tip: Facing the strip, at least from the room we were in, you are looking straight at New York New York...

I have been resistant to review in the past because I do not want too many people to know about Skylofts... But they earned it!!

I found out about skylofts 5 years ago through Amex centurion travel, and have been back 8 times since. I have stayed in all 3 size lofts and each is as nice as the next, but different enough that it is still fun to come back each time!!!

The rooms are special, but fortunately I have been able to stay in some of he nicest rooms and suites in the workd, but what sets Skylofts apart is the flawless service. These people take it seriously!!! But yet not too seriously that it is fake. It is about as genuine as I think could be possible.

The team seems to be lead by Lezlie Young, because there was a welcome back note in my room from her and different from other notes I have gotten in the past it was just the right amount of perfect.

I can't wait to go back and they earn every diamond and star after their name!!</p><br>Seems to be on a slight decline<p>I have been an avid Skyloft customer for many years, maybe 10 times in all. I originally started staying there because it was a part of the AMEX Platinum Fine Hotels and Resorts (and is currently). Well, back in the good ole days, that meant the possibility of being upgraded from a 1 bedroom to a 2 bedroom (which is really what it was originally intended to be). Now it just means 1 view to a different view. The experience is still nice, although the first day we were there we told them our coffee maker chewed 1/2 bottle of Jamaican Blue per brew and asked to be fixed, never was. Yes, i know how to work it :)....Anyway, we came from the Mirage where we experienced a Villa and an Lanai, and as i said on another review site, that is where i will be going next! If a one BR Skyloft = 1 BR Lanai for $, do yourself a favor and try the Lanai!!

One last thing...Kudos to the Skylofts for still allowing their guests to dine at the Mansion. Although i also had a problem getting that off my bill since it was supposed to be included. Hate to have to deal with that stuff on vacation!!</p><br>Wow wow<p>This is perfect. This is so high end and the service is just as well.

The room was BIG, beautiful.
Would go stay there again and again if i could afford it :-)

The staff was very freindly and the fridge was full, every time we went down to the Casino the rooms was cleaned and the fridge was full again</p><br></body></html>
