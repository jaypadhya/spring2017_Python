Wouldn't go anywhere else!!!!</p><br>21st Birthday!!!!<p>The skylofts were amazing! Butlers and concierge to take care of anything and everything you need. I would recommend to anybody! It can be a bit costly but it was well worth the money!!!</p><br>The Ultimate in Enjoyment<p>I have stayed at Skylofts 5 times over the past three years. Within that timeframe, I have seen some very slight changes that reflect the current economy, but overall you cannot find a better experience in Las Vegas. The 1 bedroom Loft is very comfortable, spacious and spotless. It really isn't the room that makes this accomodation a top notch experience, but rather the individuals that work there. From the greeter at the airport gate to the driver of the Maybach to the concierge that greets you at the hotel, everyone that I was in contact with was the most professional, courteous, and friendly hotel employees I have encountered.

My observations of slight changes over the years: Back in the day you would be provided with business cards with your name on the front. Also, fresh fruit would be awaiting your arrival upon check-in the Loft. Now they have chocolate covered raisins. At nighttime, they would have handmade chocolates in Loft. Now they have cookies. Again, certainly not a big deal whatsoever, but just my observations.

Room rates vary on the MGM website. I have paid as little as 510 per night and as much as 1100 per night. I highly recommend this exclusive hotel within a hotel. It can't be beat.</p><br>Outstanding experience<p>My wife and I stayed this past weekend and could not have been happier. The suites are beautiful with all the amenties you could ever need and then some. We have been spoiled. I think it would be very hard to stay somewhere else. The service is 5 star. They all do a spectacular job.</p><br>A Piece of Heaven on Earth<p>The sky lofts isn't a hotel, its an experience. You are met by your greeter when you arrive, then a ride in the Maybach or MGM stretch limo to the hotel, then go through the exclusive sky lobby, through the main lobby of the hotel, through the VIP lounge to a set of private elevators. Not that I am an elitist, but it feels so satisfying going though the private lounge and to your own set of elevators when everyone else is so squished and waits along time for everything. Another favourite part of mine is also that you have to use a key card to get the button in the elevator to work, oh so satisfying. Anyway, the loft is amazing and all of the staff are courteous and the loft is amazingly huge (stayed in 2 bedroom 3000sqf). The butler was very handy, although when ever you order room service they automatically give him a 20% tip on what ever you order. Also, for the room you get I think its the best value in town, you get twice the room and service you get at the Bellagio for what you pay. STAY HERE, YOU WON'T WANT TO LEAVE THE ROOM!</p><br>wow<p>This hotel is totally awesome. Limo, champagne, red wine and franch cheese, personnal concierge, hammam and the BED!... so much, you wanna live there!</p><br>good value<p>Reasonably priced (for Las Vegas) and great location. Right by the monorail stop, so its easy to get around to some of the other hotels. We liked it better than another we stayed at in Las Vegas. Staff was very helpful and we were able to buy tickets to a show right at the hotel. We picked a show that was right in the hotel (Ka). The show was great and it was relaxing not to have to go out anywhere to get to the show.</p><br>Possibly My Favourite Hotel Experience Ever<p>Having stayed in the Burj Al Arab, Dubai and the Conrad, Tokyo I still think this is my favourite hotel in the world. Unobtrusive but attentive staff, amazing decor and a real feeling of been treated as a VIP from the second you arrive. We stayed for a week and everythign was perfect. I recommend this hotel to anyone, provided your pockets are deep. Go for an afternoon to Wet Republic and eat at Joel Robuchon.</p><br>Didn't want to leave<p>Let me preface this review by saying we had been staying at the Bellagio in the 2 bedroom penthouse suites. When the included perks disappeared, so did we. Since 2007 I have become partially handicapped and returning to Las Vegas with the huge walking distances was daunting.

After reading all of the Skylofts reviews we were expecting a certain level of service and we were not disappointed. It was one of the few times I can say I had an experience that was beyond my expectations. When we arrived for our 5 night stay there was a shiny red scooter waiting and the news that our loft request was not available…we were being upgraded to the 3 bedroom loft that had an en suite elevator. This is the one suite that has not been redone with the new electronics and infinity tubs. The décor was still the European style. I don’t know how they do it but there was not a nick, a gouge in any of the furniture, a spill, a stain or speck of dust anywhere. And waiting in the entryway was a lovely cake for our 30th anniversary. I guess the point I am trying to make is you don’t need to be hipper than thou to enjoy the Skylofts.

We did have a great breakfast at the Mansion as other reviewers have mentioned and understand it is now open for lunch too. Had the fridge stocked with Coke Zero, water and pitchers of iced tea. Tried to figure out how to get the espresso machine in the luggage but thought it might be missed.

The staff was super…I am not going to name names because of fear of forgetting someone. We spent a lot on tips, all of it deserved.

And I would like to apologize for any claw marks I might have left in the Maybach as I was being dragged out of it at the airport.</p><br>Skylofts 1bdrm and Bellagio 1 Bdrm Penthouse<p>I did two nights at skylofts and two at Bellagio. Its a hard comparison, truly. Skylofts is very nice, the service is great. You get picked up in a Maybach. I arrived at 11 and couldn't check in until 3. Everyone is very nice and cordial. Skylofts is definitely worth it if you want VIP service at clubs. They do a tremendous job getting you on the lists and table service. Skylofts is a very recognized and big name in Vegas. Even when I was staying at Bellagio, I slipped skylofts into my conversation with the doorguy at Jet and we were through the door in no time. We ate at the Mansion the morning of and had missed our original reservation, however they were able to let us eat breakfast there at 11am. even though we were really hung over the food was good. The Bellagio is just very very classy and sophisticated. The penthouse is huge with his and her bathrooms and 5 T.V.s throughout. I had a lakeview which was an amazing view of the fountains from the top floor. We ate at Picasso which was amazing, very small portions, but amazing food and a little over $125 each plus the costs of wine or whatever extra. However being that they are so big they kind of lose that personl touch that skylofts emphasizes so hard on. If skylofts and Bellagio were the same price I'd definitely do skylofts. However, I would gladly spend $450 a night in bellagio penthouse on a weekday as opposed to $900 a night on a weekday at skylofts.</p><br></body></html>
