Never seen another hotel room that compares. Pool Table, Terrace overlooking the strip, Hot tub, kitchen, workout room...you name it, this hotel room as it!!!!

And the best part wasn't even the room. It was the service and professionalism of Matt Moraca and his team. These people take "Hospitality" to the next level!!

Nice work Skylofts. See you next time!!
Room Tip: No Bad Rooms at Skylofts!

For 4 days we enjoyed the superior hospitality and services from everyone: the bell desk, concierge, butlers, house-cleaning, room-service, and chauffeurs. It’s true, whatever you ask for they will get it (legal items only, please). This is the place to be if you want to feel celebrity status.
While there, we really didn’t even feel like we were in Las Vegas. Calm, serene, and private. I can’t say enough fabulous things about the Skylofts! Super bed, super bath, super shower/steam, super coffee/expresso machine, super fresh flowers, etc.

Now we are spoiled, nowhere else can satisfy, so we’ll just have to return. :)
Room Tip: You will be so mesmerized while there that you won’t even consider concentrating on seeing anything...

The trip always starts better when we stay at the Skylofts for this reason. The room was fabulous expect for one glaring problem. The room never cooled. We complained after the first night and they tried to fix it but the second night was just as hot. For the price the hotel has to find a way to cool a two bedroom suite at night. The only other problem was the room service food. The quality is terrible. The service of course is fantastic but something must be done about the food. Overall the room is always worth the money. We just love the pampering that you receive at the Skylofts. Of all the properties on the strip, this one by far has the best dedicated staff. Anything you want you get. Thank you Skylofts team for assisting in making my 40th birthday a blast.</p><br>Great Service, awesome concierge staff<p>Another great trip. Greeted at the door by Faith who took excellent care of me during my stay, followed by Paul when Faith was away. The 2 of them make a great tag team with impeccable service. The technicians offered prompt service when the battery on the TV remote died. Housecleaning did a terrific job as usual, the loft was spotless. Butler service with Jason is always very welcoming. In-house dining can still use a makeover, same menu for the last few years and not very good. Highly recommended; great stay.
Room Tip: They are good
See more room tips</p><br>Bachelor party!!<p>Came here to meet some friends and though was nice two bedroom suite seemed like wasn't cleaned thoroughly and did receive some unfriendly staff .... Didn't think worth the money for this type of service .... Next time will probly go back to Aria</p><br>unbelievable awesome 6 stars!!<p>Unbelievable over the top in luxury. We love to splurge every now and then and enjoy the finer things in life this is a must for everyone!! They have thought of everything but some of my favorite things about this place is the bathtub and the awesome television!! Theres so much more check it out and see</p><br>Perfect.<p>Exactly what you want and expect from skylofts in Vegas - lavish, beautiful, comfortable and amazing. The view from the windows is amazing, and the beds very comfortable. Every little detail was thought out and perfected.</p><br>Small Wedding Reception<p>We stayed in the 2 bedroom Skyloft Suite in May 2015 and it was quite an amazing experience! My husband and I utilized this room as our wedding night suite but also as our wedding reception space. We had approximately 40 guests, which you did not feel in the suite, there was plenty of space for our guests to relax on different seating areas and to roam around. Our personal concierge (unfortunately we can't remember your names!) were absolutely PHENOMENAL! Anything that we needed, they would complete the task without hesitation or another reminder. They certainly make you feel like you are a high rolling celebrity when you stay here.

We've already decided that we will be staying here again for one of our anniversaries!</p><br>Absolutely exquisite<p>I had been looking to stay here for years and finally decided to pull the trigger and book a night. It was absolutely worth it. While staying here is an expensive proposition, for the amenities you receive and the quality of the loft itself, the price is a bargain.

The loft itself, despite being 10 years old is still beautiful and is very modern. Everything is clean, well maintained, and is designed to provide the guest with comfort. While the first floor areas are great, it is the 2nd floor, especially the bathroom that makes this suite stand out compared to other 5 star options in Las Vegas. Not only is the bathroom huge, the infinity tub (a $10,000 tub) is fun to use, and the shower is like no other in Vegas. Ours had two rain heads, 4 wall sprayers, and a wand. To top it off, it comes with a great steam function. The shower alone is the size of low end Vegas hotel bathrooms.

The bed is comfortable, the Crestron remotes actually work here, unlike Hotel32's which were horrible. The free water, juice, and sodas are so helpful especially in 100 degree plus July weather.

On top of all this the service here is simply amazing. The staff including the butlers and concierges were all very kind and personable. Mrs. Vargas, our first butler was especially nice as she actually took the time to engage us in pleasant conversation vs just mere politeness. Practically every request was granted, including giving us use of the Rolls Royce Ghost to take us to and from dinner. This was especially fun as we chose to eat at the amazing The Steakhouse at Circus Circus, a hotel that probably sees a Rolls Royce as often as Death Valley sees snow.

If you decide to stay here, and I hope you will, make sure to request breakfast or any other meal in the Estate Dining Room at The Mansion. This was the most delicious breakfast I have ever eaten, and for the little we paid, it was a steal. You would almost as much to eat at a hotel cafe as you would here.

The only negative was that in the July heat the loft got a little warm and wouldn't cool below 70, though I personally like my hotel rooms frigid.

I would absolutely stay here again not just for the amazing room but for the amazing people that work here. I also just really like the MGM Grand. Thank you Skyloft team for the amazing stay.</p><br>Exceptional - made our trip!!<p>We took road trip from Denver to Vegas and saw much of southwest
