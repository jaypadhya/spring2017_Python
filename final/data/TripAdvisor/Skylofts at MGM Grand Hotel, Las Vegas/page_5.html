<html><head><h3>Skylofts at MGM Grand Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 5</h3></head><body><br>Simply the best hotel EVER!<p>I honestly cannot imagine anyone staying here and having a less than amazing stay. I do travel often and have stayed in some amazing hotels in my time but this far exceeds all of them. This felt more than 5 star and I loved every second. Honestly there is far too much to rave about but if you're contemplating staying there the simple answer is book now! The butler, the steam room shower, the over sized closet and the overflowing light changing bath that overlooks the TV built into the mirror are not even the main reasons to stay...though the Bvlargari tea bath was the definition of paradise. The attention to detail is fantastic and our butler told us we were able to play the sound system in the living area or upstairs in the bathroom to maximum volume and no one would hear which again was great. But the staff made that trip we were there for my husband's 40th and honestly it was just the best service ever experienced. I had been contacted about our stay before we arrived and ordered balloons and a cake and it was all set up as expected and every question I had was answered so promptly. We had gold limo service even when we spent the latter part of our trip in the Signature. We flew in from Texas then headed to the Grand Canyon so didn't get the airport pick up but did get transfer and drop off to the airport. Our concierge Maria was fantastic despite me renaming her Caroline and the comp bottle of champagne on my husbands birthday was fantastic. EVERYONE has a smile on their face and are so helpful so friendly our only regret was we only did 3 days and didn't stay for longer. But we will be back and can't wait!</p><br>Skylofts m g m grand<p>If anyone is planning a trip to Vegas you should consider the skyloft mgm grand I traveled there with my teenage kids and the entire experience was wonderful the rooms are amazing and the staff was amazing they made us feel like we were the most important people there

Went for a hen do, 5 girls, get picked up from airport in a Cadillac, chauffeur style service is amazing.We booked a 2 story 2 bedroom loft. It is expensive so save well, but we do not regret it 1 bit. Had jacuzzi s, pool table, marble floors, cinema room! for being Sky loft guests you have your own special lifts and lobby area to walk through, makes you feel even more special! absolutely fantastic experience and would only want to stay here again! it is a party popping place!
Room Tip: Face the strip

Everything from the pick-up at the airport in a RR Ghost to in-room check-in and butler service were incredible. The food charges for room service are a bit on the high side so just double check the prices before going crazy...</p><br>Surreal!<p>To start my experience I was picked up by Mike my driver and driven to Skylofts in a Rolls Royce, Then greeted like a royal outside the MGM by entourage of Skyloft employees. Adele my concierge for the night explained everything and was very informative as we walked through the Skylofts lobby and MGM casino. When I reached the top I was in awe of the reception area, it was a modern but cosy atmosphere as for the room it was breathtakingly beautiful, the view was priceless (felt as if I was in New York). My butler for the evening were Sammy and Misty, both of them were attentive and friendly. The steak I had for dinner, was the best steak I‘ve had, it wasn't small either (compliments to the chef) as for the green tea bath I requested, it felt as if I was in paradise. Did not make great use of the entertainment available as I was tired after my flight, but when I was awaken by my requested wake up call I made great use of the PS4, graphics and gameplay were unreal much better than the requested PS3. Before breakfast I took a shower which was unlike anything I‘ve experienced before, breakfast menu had a variety of choices, I chose buttermilk pancakes and a bowl of granola served with fruit. In a matter of minutes my butler Maria set the table and presented me with beautiful breakfast, I thoroughly enjoyed. Soon after breakfast I decided to go shop for souvenirs with the intention of charging it to my room, having shopped for an array of souvenirs at the MGM store It seemed that the clerk as well as the manager couldn't find my room on the system, I felt embarrassed when the manager refused to charge the items to my room, even though I presented him my room key and passport. So having left empty handed I headed back up to Skylofts, explained everything to the two concierge who sat in the reception area (one named Blake, cant remember the name of the female concierge) they frantically apologized and phoned the store manager and explained to him that their behavior was unacceptable, they then sent Maria to get my items, I was overwhelmed by their response. Not only that but Blake extended my check out time and checked me in to my suit at the MGM and booked a table for me at Joel Robuchon. Words cannot justify how one is treated whilst staying at Skylofts, it was truly a great way to start a magical vacation.</p><br>No Place quite like it!<p>There is really no place quite like Skylofts. I have stayed here many times and, I have to say, each time when I think there is no way it can be as good, or that something will go wrong, the stay exceeds my expectations. Each staff member takes the time to make me and each of the people in our group feel like we are home. Skylofts, time and time again, is my favorite hotel experience bar none!</p><br>Best luxury hotel on the strip.<p>Beautiful loft, excellent service and great food! We were literally waited on hand and foot. They asked why we were there and then gave my daughter a personalized card and chocolate covered strawberries. Great value if you can get the loft at $750 not the inflated price when there's certain venue at the hotel.</p><br>Great boutique on top of mgm<p>The rooms are outstanding. Like everything in Vegas it is over the top and you wouldn't expect anything else.
Liked:
The beds are amazing and so are the linens

Disliked: the actual route to get to the top on the sky loft

Recommend for all</p><br>Best Suite Ever , Best Service Ever , Best Hotel Ever , WOW<p>Stayed here for 3 nights in September , It certainly isn't cheap but its worth every single penny. From the minute you arrive the staff make you feel ultra special. You enter through a single entry next to the main MGM entry into a small private lobby , you are greeted there by a bell boy and a member of the concierge who check your name against the arrivals , they then take your bags and call another member of the concierge to walk you to your loft. Whilst walking to your loft the concierge goes through everything with you and when I say everything I mean it , they really know there stuff and are so polite and helpful. To get to the Skylofts which are all situated on the 29th floor of the MGM you need to use your room key card in the lift to gain access to the floor ( similar to alot of the big suites on the strip ). After the lifts you are taken straight to your loft where you are introduced to your butler for your Loft ( they don't actually stay in your room they are just there when you call them or ask them to be there ). After the usual paper work you are free to use your loft. We were loft 71 , a one bedroom loft , set over 2 floors , we had the following ; Large dining area , coffee machine , stocked mini fridge featuring complimentary soft drinks , large living area , small office area , downstairs wc , upstairs bedroom with large screen tv , large bathroom with infinity bath tub , 2 wash basins , a walk in immersion chamber featuring monsoon showers and steam facility , walk in closet. Everything about the Loft was quality from the complimentary toiletries ( Bvlgari bath and wash accessories and Coola Sun lotion ) to the pillows on the bed. The whole Loft was controlled by a wireless system which controlled TV , Drapes , Light , Music , Ipod and Temperature. The view from our loft was pretty impressive also with great views of the north of the strip. The Lofts are a great place to sit back and relax and to be honest you would never need to leave. When you do leave you are always spoken to by the concierge staff in the main lobby who are so friendly and always wanting to help you. The cleaning team arrange an ideal time for the nightly turn down service so not to disturb you , they even leave a little note on the bed at night with an inspirational quote ( another nice little feature ). The cocktail bar in the lobby is a little bit of an afterthought however the cocktails are fab and the free appetizers are a nice touch. The downstairs lobby is ideal to get a taxi , there is never any queue. Being a Loft guest means the concierge will be able to fulfil pretty much any request you can possibly have. As a Lofts guest you can also eat at the Mansion at MGM which is well worth trying even if just for breakfast ( see my separate review for that ). I would really love to stay here again , I have stayed at alot of the top suites in Vegas and this so far is the best by a good distance. If money is no object for your trip , be sure to book this up. PS I nearly forgot the Lofts will also provide complimentary Rolls Royce Travel to and From the airport :)</p><br>Romantic stay with my wife at the Skylofts<p>This was a return trip for me, but the first trip for my wife to the Skylofts at MGM. We had a wonderful stay. The service is some of the best in the world and the One-Bedroom City View Skyloft we had was beautiful.

We booked through Amex Platinum which provided a resort credit and free breakfast each day. Breakfast can be in room dining, or eating at the beautiful "Mansion" restaurant (the secret high roller area in MGM). I highly recommend that if you book through Amex Platinum, take full advantage of the access to the Mansion.

Pros:
-Full time butlers available for your every need. We had the butlers set up dinner, we selected from the "pillow menu" and even had them draw a bath for my wife. "No" was in their vocabulary (although we did not ask for anything too outrageous).
-Loft is beautifully appointed and clean.
-Private lobby on top floor provides a place to "get away" from the hustle of MGM.
-In room beverages that are included in the Loft prices. Very convenient for that late night bottle of water or that caffeine fix before you hit the tables.
-An afternoon snack was usually waiting for us on return to the room.
-Amenities are Bulgari and wonderful

Cons:
-I have one gripe with the Skylofts, and this is something we noticed in our last stay. In the hot Vegas summer, being on the top floor with floor to ceiling windows...the Loft can get stuffy. There is an A/C system for the entire loft, but it doesn't seem to quite cool down the Loft as much as you would like. I always felt a little warm upstairs in the bedroom until the A/C unit could catch up and cool it down around 2 AM, which made sleeping a little more difficult than it should have. My advice would be for the MGM to seriously consider replacing or expanding the tonnage of the A/C in the lofts, especially in the summer. One "fix" the butlers recommended was utilizing the black out shades all day...this helped, but then why have the floor to ceiling windows?

Other than that...I highly recommend Skylofts to everyone. Well worth the price.</p><br></body></html>
