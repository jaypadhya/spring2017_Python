<html><head><h3>Skylofts at MGM Grand Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 11</h3></head><body><br>Birthday Weekend<p>So I've been to the Skylofts many times with friends, but this was the first time I've booked a room myself, and for my girlfriend for her birthday. As usual it was amazing. People don't often come to Las Vegas to relax, but the Lofts give you that choice as they seem a world away from the craziness that is Las Vegas. From the pre coordination of the trip by Noelani Paselio, which was flawless, she's really great, and she allowed me to concentrate on my girlfriend with all the details (birthday cake, transportation, show tickets, breakfast at the mansion) being taken care of. I couldn't have asked for more. I will be back, and, as usual, will continue to send friends to the lofts. You're the best!

P.S. My girlfriend loved Michelle at the spa
P.P.S I requested Leroy, but I guess he wasn't available but he's been great every time I'm there!</p><br>Happy camper<p>This past weekend three friends and I stayed in the Sky Loft Suites and all I have to say is WOW. I was completely mind blown when I entered the suite. The staff was incredible, helped with anything and everything we needed. Blake and Leeroy really were the best! I can't imagine traveling anywhere else and not staying in these suites. I won this trip through work so this was quite an upgrade from places that I usually can afford to stay in. All in all we had an absolutely amazing weekend, starting with the rolls royce pick up to our champagne toast when we walked in, to the staff being sooooooo overly accommodating.</p><br>Best in Vegas<p>The service and attention to detail was fantastic from the moment of booking to check out. Every member of the team went the extra mile to accommodate any request. The lofts themselves were very impressive and in particular the bathrooms and sauna. The in loft dining and room service is also highly recommended. Cant wait to go back!
Room Tip: Ask for a strip view

Very spacious layout. Would recommend for a group! I like the pool table, couches were comfy, bed felt amazing.</p><br>Best Customer Service Experience of My Life<p>Yes, the room itself is beautiful and filled with amenities to the point where we didn't even have time to use them all. However, it was the customer service that my friends and I experienced by the Skyloft staff that will make it hard for us to ever choose another hotel when we return to Las Vegas. We were treated like royalty. We appreciated everything our concierge and butler did for us and we will most likely return and upgrade to the pool suite. Thank you thank you thank you for making my birthday the best yet!</p><br>Magical Luxury<p>I have stayed in a wide selection of hotels on the Strip, and Skylofts makes every other property look like a Holiday Inn.

As a surprise for our anniversary, I booked a night in a one bedroom loft (#71!!) From the comfortable limo ride to our private check in, the arrival experience was absolutely flawless. Special nod to Teddy for making me laugh!

Per my request, we had a strip facing loft directly diagonal from the "Grand" sign. The view was jaw-dropping. I had also requested some little treats and surprises for my partner and they were set up elegantly for us. He was so surprised!

Our butler, Pat, was astounding. She instantly made us feel at ease and took care of all our needs. From the champagne and chocolate covered strawberries, to the fresh fruit and fantastic cheese, we were spoiled rotten.

We also were able to eat breakfast at the Mansion! If you stay, I highly recommend making that request. You will not regret it.

There are too many other features and delights to write about, but being able to tour Loft 97(!) and having a butler draw our bath with rose petals are two things I need to mention.


And to prove that actions speak louder than words, I actually booked a second night within hours of checking in.


Thank you so much to all the staff at Skylofts for making our anniversary the best one yet!
Room Tip: Ask for a loft with a plunge pool!
See more room tips</p><br>Fantastic luxury and Service......!<p>Recently stayed at the Skylofts. What a great find this was. After narrowing down some other high end properties on the strip, we picked this one.
The pre arrival concierge Noelani was wonderful. She handled our dinner reservations and show tickets, transportation to and from the airport, and made sure we had our choice of beverages stocked in the mini fridge.

We were greeted promptly at the airport and had a limo ride. Ah one note on the limo ride. It was a older limo with some torn seats, definitely showing its wear. Note to management perhaps send nicer cars or limos for your guests when picking them up at the airport. I was not thrilled with the limo itself. The driver was very nice however.

At arrival at Skylofts, they offered beverages and took our luggage to our room. We did have an early arrival, however our room was ready. They escorted us to our room. You do have to walk through the main lobby of the MGM Grand, but there is a separate bank of elevators that takes you up to the Skylofts.

The staff was very professional and wonderful. The service was beyond fantastic. Walking down the hallway the staff was at our suite waiting for us. We did have a different butler each day. They restocked our beverages, pressed clothes etc and took care of anything else that we may have wanted. We received a complimentary tray of chocolate covered strawberries which were heavenly! We got a tour of the loft - how to work, tubs, showers, and the Creston touch screen controls for the lights, music, drapes, etc.

The suites was very clean and nice. They obliged our request not to have a suite facing south-suites facing south face the airport and Hooters Hotel.

The maid service was wonderful. They replenished supplies and towels. Turn down service nightly was wonderful. Leaving notes and flowers on the bed and soft music playing. We also received little desserts each evening and were put on the dining table.


Noelani also managed to secure 3 days of breakfast at the Mansion. The Mansion is by invitation only. Definitely recommend breakfast there. The butler has to escort you in each morning. Only guests of the Skylofts and Mansion may dine there. The entrance is private behind some unmarked gates off the casino area. We ate out in the courtyard. Felt like we were in Italy, surrounded by a fountain, greenery, beautiful flowers. The food was outstanding. Especially the Tahitian Vanilla French Toast and Waffles. There were no other diners there. It was peaceful and quiet and romantic. Hard to believe one was still in Las Vegas.

It was hard to leave after our stay. We did get a ride back to the airport in the Ghost Rolls Royce. What a fantastic car. The driver was wonderful as well.

5 stars for the Skylofts and 5 stars to the staff... Joe, Noelani, Sherman, Maria and the maids.
You made our stay fantastic! You spoiled us.... :-)
Room Tip: Get a room facing North or West. Avoid rooms facing south and east. Hooters is not a good view.

See more room tips</p><br>Best Hotel in Las Vegas<p>Whenever we are in Las Vegas, we don't think of staying anywhere else- not even the Mansions anymore!! From the concierges (except for Sara [Asian, 30 years old], whom was constantly *RUDE* to us), to the butlers, to the bellmen, to the Chefs.

Notable concierges include James Choi and Sherman!!!!! And my favorite butler is JUSTIN (Asian, just got married!)!!! Anyway, this trip I had a truly remarkable experience. I was craving Chinese food at 2:15 in the morning. I called down, and they kindly suggested a restaurant on property that had a small offering of Chinese food on the menu. Unfortunately, they were cleaning the part of the kitchen that they cooked the Chinese food in. However, the in-house Skyloft Chef, James, offered to give the Beef with Broccoli I'd asked for a shot. Turned out to be the BEST Beef with Broccoli I have ever had!! Must have been filet mignon, as it melted in my mouth! Room service is a little pricey, but I do not think you can put a price on extraordinary quality. I have yet to eat an even unremarkable meal from room service. Butlers set your table, and then clean up after you are finished. Just an amazing experience from beginning to end. Another great meal was my daily pasta with bolognese sauce (had to have been made from scratch) and fresh mozzarella and garlic bread. Pasta was cooked PERFECT every time and the consistency of the food was almost unbelievable.

I especially enjoy the Skylofts because I'm not exactly a "people person." Private elevators whisk you from the casino to your sanctuary high above the Las Vegas strip. Room service is Peninsula caliber, or possibly superior!! Private valet and bellmen make getting your car or luggage up to your room a breeze. We had arrived with our luggage with us and everything was waiting for us when we arrived at our in-suite check in. How did they do it? David Copperfield must have made everything appear upstairs. Also, the design of the rooms and Bang and Olufsen (been a fan since I was 14) electronics is nearly unmatched. The ease of use of the Crestron All-In-One remote control is just sensational.

Which brings me to the SINGLE negative aspect of our trip. Sara, a concierge, was remarkably rude the last 2 trips this summer. She was SO rude that I even asked her if I'd done something grossly inappropriate, even though I'm certain that I hadn't, to which her response was "no, sorry." After I asked her why she was rude, she replied, "I'm sorry." I wasn't sure if she was just a rube, or if she thought I was a dullard and wouldn't notice, or care, or what! However, I do know that I count two or three other people that I have encountered in the hospitality industry in my life that have treated me as such. I was not angry, just disappointed. How could someone like this slip through the cracks, and still be there months later (our first stay this summer was Memorial Day). Anyway, I'll probably still be back, but I think I'll write an additional letter to upper management and Fedex it, so someone actually reads it.

If you're looking for a PRIVATE, DISCREET, luxurious hotel to stay in Las Vegas, don't look at the Four Seasons (which I've been staying at since I was 12?). They have NOTHING on the Skylofts!!! If you give the Skylofts a shot, you will not be disappointed.
Room Tip: All of the lofts are excellent. I have yet to stay in a "bad" loft.
See more room tips</p><br>Experience of a lifetime<p>From the moment you're picked up in a Rolls Royce to the moment you leave, you are pampered beyond belief. We chose this hotel based on the excellent reviews and top notch service you are supposed to receive and we were not disappointed.

I proposed to my fiancée at the Skylofts and the Skylofts team made sure everything was executed to perfection. I had so many notes and details and was afraid they would miss something but get everything down to perfection.

Some highlights of this stay:

1) Getting picked up and dropped off in a Rolls Royce
2) Having breakfast at the Mansion
3) Not having to iron any of my clothes - all taken care of by the butler team
4) The immersion chamber that is the shower - seriously the best showers I've had
5) Getting pampered 24/7
6) Amazing butler service
7) Getting engaged :)

Till next time!</p><br></body></html>
