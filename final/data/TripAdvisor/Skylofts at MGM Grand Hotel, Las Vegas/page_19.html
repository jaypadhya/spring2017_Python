<html><head><h3>Skylofts at MGM Grand Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 19</h3></head><body><br>Can you beat top-notch service and a room with a view?<p>We stayed here for our anniversary. I booked through Amex Fine Hotels and Resorts Program. We were greeted at the airport gate by a personal escort and taken to the hotel in the Maybach. Our dinner & show reservations were just as we wanted. We were upgraded to a two bedroom suite. Spa appointments were perfect. I had left my Kindle in the room and an attendant went to get it for me and brought it to the pool so I wouldn't have to be bothered.
I can't think of another place I'd rather stay.</p><br>Great room, great local<p>We stayed over Cinco de Mayo weekend. We unknowingly booked the same weekend as the Pacquiao fight. Not the hotel's fault, but it was packed. Lines for food were ridiculous. I wouldn't recommend traveling a fight weekend, unless you're going to the fight.

We stay at MGM for their awesome pool and comfy beds. I've stay at MGM almost every time I travel to Vegas, and they never disappoint.</p><br>The ultimatre in hotel living<p>So we booked this room over a weekend for a going away party for my friend in the Navy. He's getting deployed to the Middle East, and he requested a Hangover-style suite. Well talk about exceeding expectations. Greeted upon arrival right up the ramp from the airplane. No need to worry about your luggage -- the greeter takes it for you. Transfer from the airport in a limo (missed the Maybach by thismuch, someone got it right before me). Greeted by one of our concierges at the front door. Private check in upstairs. Upgrade to the 2-bedroom (going from 1400 sq ft up to 3000 sq ft, huge difference). Stunning accomodations. As big as my house. Two living room areas, 2 table/rest areas, a dining room area set up with food and alcohol we requested before arrival, free movies and non-alcoholic beverages, a pool table, bedrooms with full walk-in closets, infinity tubs, flat screen TVs everywhere, and even a bidet. Is that too much? Butler service was out of this world. Concierge set up whatever we wanted. Made great suggestions. Did I mention the breakfast at The Mansion? The best meal I have ever had, and I am very picky with my food, in an aviary with a fountain and about 3 other people. Absolute bliss. Words can not explain how incredible the overall experience was. I don't think I can ever stay at another place in Vegas again (without it being compe anyway). If you have a chance, stay here. You will never look at Vegas the same again.</p><br>Near Excellent<p>Spent 3 nights at Skylofts while on vacation in Vegas.

For the price (about $1.000 / night), in Vegas, I expect perfection. My expectations were nearly met, but there was a hiccup...

Upon arrival (by car) we were greeted by a dedicated Skylofts concierge at the Skylofts entrance, then walked through the main lobby, to the elevators to the 29th floor, were the Skylofts are located, and quickly shown to our room by a "butler".

The room was fantastic. Two levels, dinning / living room and a small guest bathroom on the 1st level, bedroom, main bathroom and walk in-closet in the second level. If you don't like walking up and down stairs all the time, this is not a suite for you. Very nice decoration (especially for Vegas standards, where usually everything is very kitsch) and very high tech (everything is controlled by remotes). Huge suite, with nice amenities. Walk in shower / steam room, walk in closet, and "champagne bubbles" tub, with 2 TVs in the bathroom (a small one over the sinks, and one over the tub), TV in the bedroom and B&O TV / system in the living room. Jura coffee maker, free movies (all kinds!), free soft drinks and water (Voss). Overall, near perfect.

2 issues:
* Very pricey in room dining options. For breakfast, with just a few things (some pastries, fruit, and oatmeal), we paid about $50... I think that they should review their in-room pricing dining policies, especially given the very high room rates.
* The super-duper tub... On the second day, I decided to give it a go, and relax and watch a movie while soaking. I filled it up, as instructed, but it never worked. Bummer... So, when we left for dinner on the second night, I reported this to the concierges on the Skylofts lobby. They said they would look into it. the next night, at around 12am, I decided to have a bath, once again. Same routine, filled up the tub, and again nothing. When I contacted the concierge, they said that nothing had been done, and very sorry about that. "Sorry"? For $1.000 / night, "sorry" is not an option! They sent a butler, who simply assessed the situation, and concurred that the tub was not working. By then it was 1am. Then they sent someone from engineering, who quickly figured it out: The switch in the fuse box was off... And then, at 1:30am, on the 3rd night, I got to finally use the tub. Not the level of service I would expect though.

So, overall, this is a really nice place to stay in Vegas. But they need a little something extra, some more "free perks", and impeccable service if they ever want to become No. 1 in that town.</p><br>Right up there with some of the best<p>We have stayed at the MGM Grand in suites on quite a number of occassions but this time I asked for an upgrade and paid a tad more to stay in a Skyloft suite. Well what a surprise the size was, two stories of real modern luxury and a butler and maid on call for whatever you needed.

The butler service was superb and the maids made sure that everything was better than it needed to be. We had an afternoon nap and whilst we had supper the maids changed the bed linen for the second time that day.

The total lighting and entertainment system is touch panel control and the computer has its own alcove so it is quiet whilst others watched TV or listened to music.

The staff on the Skyloft floor are eager to please. I required medication so they organised a doctor to phone me and tablets were delivered to my room within the hour. Great place to stay. I'll do it again next month.
Room Tip: Ask for upgrades they are cheap sometimes

Ok, so it is part of the MGM Hotel, but this matters not (in fact the Joel Rubichon restaurant sits in the MGM and this cannot be missed. As a guest in Skylofts this is an easy booking) Is a hotel within a hotel and you are treated as such. Rooms are simply beautiful (bathrooms even more so), OTT but stylish. Expensive - yes. Worth it - definately. Concierge is a class apart... tickets (best seats in the house) available for shows/clubs, etc - no notice required. Two minor gripes - Maybach late at pick up from airport, and getting a laptop was an issue - but minor gripes for a superb place. Would return.</p><br>Vegas done right<p>I've stayed as the Skylofts multiple times, I honestly couldn't pinpoint the exact reason why anymore, it's just an amazing hotel. At first it was a decision, where to stay... but now, once you go Skylofts you just don't go back.

The service - It's a different level of quality. My friends and I love Vegas, we go about once a year. And when we go, we don't like to hustle for too much. Every single reservation I needed for anything around town, the Skylofts concierge took care of. Their service is impeccable.

The room - you know those shows you watch on TV where the actors walk into this unbelievable room and you think to yourself, I wish I could stay in places like that... that's Skylofts. First time I walked into our 3 bedroom, two-story loft with huge windows overlooking Vegas, my jaw dropped. The amenities in the loft are just stunning (electronic controlled everything, the showers are bigger than most NYC apartments)

If you're on your way to Vegas and the Skylofts aren't fully booked, book it!!!</p><br>Luxury without pretention. Service staff we wanted to fold up, put in our pocket and take home.<p>Our company hosted party during a very large expo held at the Las Vegas Convention Center. We secured a two-story, two-bedroom suite that was wall-to-wall sleek, sophisticated and down-right amazing. Each detail was covered thanks to the stellar staff who saw to our every need. Our guests were welcomed and wowed while our staff was able to get down to business and make real connections. A definite return destination for a work and for personal travel.</p><br>If you like perfect, thats what you get here.<p>Skylofts @ MGM Grand is without a doubt the best hotel experience in the world.
spectacular rooms with all the latetest electronics. BUT what makes it special is the
staff's attention to detail. They cant do enough for you... Ritz and Four seasons do NOT
compare...</p><br>First class in every respect.<p>If you're looking for complete luxury you want to stay in the MGM Grand's Skyloft Suites. Our personal butler took care of all arrangements so we could focus on other things. Room was fantastic, view was wonderful. Hands down the best Las Vegas experience ever.</p><br></body></html>
