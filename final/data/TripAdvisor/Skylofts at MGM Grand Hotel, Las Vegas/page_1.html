I Could Have Stayed In The Room The Entire Time And Had A Great Time. Next Time - A Room With A View Of The Strip.
Very Quiet, Great Shower, Awesome Sound System.</p><br>Amazing Experience!<p>From the time we walked through the doors until check out, the Skyloft staff provided the best service. Rooms are amazing and fully represent what you see online. Butler service is a great perk as well as the around town and airport limo service.</p><br>Skylofts visit<p>Great first visit to MGM properties! Was a surprise birthday for the wife and she LOVED it!! Bluetooth streaming to home theatre was very nice as was total remote control access to lighting, drapes and HVAC!</p><br>Luxury at it's finest!!!<p>I recently stayed at the SkyLofts for the very first time. I hosted my 50th birthday celebration inside of my loft. After researching several properties, I came across the SkyLofts. OMG!!! From the moment of being picked up at the airport in a Rolls Royce Ghost, and greeted by name by our driver, I was in complete awe and extremely satisfied with my selection! We were greeted right at the curb by our ambassador who turned us over to our personal concierge. The concierge escorted us up to the loft where we checked-in directly in our loft. It was there where we met our daytime Butler manager. Tanisha is her name. Words cannot describe the genuine customer service provided to us by Tanisha. She made my every wish come true and most importantly with a huge SMILE. But that's not it! Next my evening Butler manager was equally amazing! His name was William. William picked up where Tanisha left off and every need was met. He seemed more excited for me. Of course, with a huge SMILE. To summarize my first stay here at the SkyLofts, I must say, it was the best experience ever! From the housekeeping staff to the concierge staff, the entire experience exceedingly surpassed my expectations. I don't know how I would ever lodge anywhere else in LV but here at the SkyLofts. To the entire SkyLofts staff, A BIG THANK YOU for making my 50th birthday celebration memories beautiful and radiant!</p><br>Luxurious stay in a gorgeous suite!<p>We stayed 4 nights at the MGM Skyloft and can only describe it as magnificent! The wondrous experience started with our Rolls Royce airport pickup!!!! We were swiftly checked in in our suite where we got to meet our butler who explained everything that we needed in the room. The staff were very efficient and we're easily able to accommodate a couple of rather unusual requests that we had with ease! There were a couple of minor hiccups (things happen) but they were dealt with swiftly and painlessly. Our only bugbear is that we didn't like that the staff stopped what they were doing and cleared the hallway whenever we walked past - we are all only human and they shouldn't feel that they have to do this for anybody! On the whole a wonderful stay and I would definitely recommend the hotel to anybody. If you want to feel like a VIP then you've gotta stay here!!!</p><br>Amazing Experience<p>This was our first time at the Skylofts and it was amazing! Everything about our stay was excellent. The 2 bedroom Skyloft was to die for and the amenities are also a plus. You are pampered at the Skylofts this is now our favorite spot!</p><br>Literally another level of luxury<p>Our Skyloft experience actually started when we were collected by the hotel's Rolls Royce Ghost. Luxury at its finest. I would run out of superlatives to describe our stay here at MGM Skyloft.

We were greeted by name outside the hotel upon arrival. We were then immediately shown to our loft (83) where check in is completed.

The room has a "wow!" factor and I genuinely cannot describe how you feel when you walk in. It is like being in the Hangover and every other Vegas movie rolled into one!

We had a pool room, two luxury bedrooms with uber soft beds, two infinity baths, a steam room, all mod cons like bluetooth to the B&O sound system, we had rooms we could barely use because we didn't have long enough there! The views were also amazing!!

We had our own butler who was extremely attentive and showed us round the whole loft and was there whenever requested.

Our one overriding biggest disappointment was that we only had one night to make the most of our stay. We had dinner at Hakkasan and then visited Hakkasan night club and ended up returning to our loft and playing pool until 7am because we didn't want to go to sleep!!

Skyloft, you have something very special here - maintain the very highest of standards and don't change! We cannot wait to return!!!
Room Tip: We had loft 83 and it was a two bedroom option. Views were unbelievable and I couldn't fault it.

They have all the tickets available for shows and the KA show is the greatest, plus the
David Copperfield show. The grand pool is another good place to chill off. Restaurants are very good (Fiamma) especially. Enjoy the casino, it takes your money
very fast. We truly enjoyed our stay. Weather was very hot, air conditioning a must.
Room Tip: sky loft the best or one of the three MGM towers - Tower 2, 32 floor

We must give props and shout outs to Yumi and Joe for being the consummate professional butlers they are and to Paul in concierge services (as well as all the other Skyloft concierge staff). Service with a smile--always. That's what the Skylofts are all about, period. We think Joe had eyes on the back of his head because every time we saw him walking down the hallway he would stop at our door, wait for us to make our way there, and then open the room door for us without ever realizing he even saw us coming. While the rooms are awesome...the service is where it's at. True professionals all working together to make your stay awesome and spectacular. Our host Keith was awesome as always and we appreciate all the help he provided as well.</p><br>stunning<p>stunning hotel!
