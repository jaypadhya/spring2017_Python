<html><head><h3>Skylofts at MGM Grand Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 12</h3></head><body><br>A disappointing visit<p>I am a Repeat Customer to Skylofts. I have always hated the MGM casino but loved Skylofts enough to put up with walking through the MGM Casino. Now, unfortunately, MGM has taken over from whoever owned or ran Skylofts before. ( I actually asked at one point- "Let me guess, MGM took over this place, right?")("Yes- how did you know?") #DontLoveSkyloftsAnyMore. It has become the rotting cherry on top of the pile of awful that is the MGM Grand Hotel.

Decor and Suite size, of course, always great. I recommend staying in one of these suites (preferably in Winter) to experience the showers just once- you can drown standing up! While landing your helicopter as well! I mean it's big.)

Butlers and Bell Staff, mostly great. Butlers not as plentiful or generous as previous visits.
"Concierges" HORRIBLE!!!!!!!! Some of the female concierges get what I like to call, "The Four Seasons Thing" (I can't go to Four Seasons any more, they outlawed smoking there- not that I smoke in Vegas or anything, 'cause that would be wrong), but most of them, particularly one doltish, heavyset fellow who looked like he picked his shirt back up off of the dirty clothes pile that morning (keep the jacket on, buddy), were infuriatingly inept, and did NOT get the "Four Seasons" thing.

WEAK AIR CONDITIONING IN AUGUST!!!!!!!! And for two days, nobody would do anything about it, made lame excuses, and acted like I was being unnecessarily difficult. ("Your room has windows and that makes it hard to keep cool in Summer") Finally, after two sleepless nights, I let them know we had enough and would be leaving, and I received a visit from a nice man named Mark, who was some sort of Manager. He moved us to another room, and things improved. At least we had air. And they gave us a nice credit toward room charges. Why couldn't they have taken action sooner? I can't get those two nights back, but that is not their problem. The hilarious finish to that issue was that I had to go back to our old room the next morning to retrive my hot spot wi-fi thingy, and there were three workmen there with tarps and tools spread all over, and the air conditioning was blasting copious amounts of cold air all over them. Note to self, if you need air conditioning, invite the building painters and HVAC guys up for a drink.

Other Highlights:

Getting to share our "exclusive" elevator (The "exclusive" elevator to Skylofts serves a number of other floors) with drunken golfers and the other the other lovely party guests of the Meegum, was unpleasant, to say the least. They all stare as you put your key in the slot and push the large "Skylofts" button, VERY uncomfortable, nowadays.

$9 beers. Beer tastes so much better when you pay 10x the normal price for it, don't you think? (I guess $10 was out of the question.)
Waiting one hour for bell staff to come get the bags so we can finally GTFO
In room coffee makers that don't work- at all
In room refrigerators that don't work- at all
Screws and pieces falling off of doors and furniture
Radically uncomfortable pillows and bedding
$350 room service dinners for the family. For sandwiches and pasta- nothing fancy.
Heated up Stairwells, Heated up desks next to heated up windows, Heated up bedrooms, Heat heat heat.(I get it- #wewerehot)

The last piece of advice: If a place that used to charge $2,500 a night now charges $1,200 a night, it's not necessarily a good thing. It may be a sign that those willing and able to foot the $2,500 bill have moved to more suitable digs. In the case of the Skylofts, that is undoubtedly what has taken place. Guess I'll have to give Steve Wynn and Sheldon Adelson a shot- but I dislike the red suites (Wynn) and the smell of the Ventian (too perfume-y!) Ahhh- Bellagio- You Win! (until MGM manages to screw that one up too)</p><br>Outstanding<p>The SkyLofts are the best rooms in Vegas. My family and I are very pleased with the room, staff and the food. We are already planning another trip to Vegas before the end of the year and we will be staying at the MGM SkyLofts.</p><br>The Hotel within a hotel - Average<p>If you stay at the Skylofts you expect excellent everything from the service to the cleaning to the food and don't get me wrong usually it is. But not this time. We go to Las Vegas 3 to 4 times a year and always stay in the Skylofts. Everyone knows us and they usually get it right, every once in a while I change some of habits and they are more than accommodating to change my profile to reflect my needs. We all know the rooms are great, love that espresso machine. In this review I want to write about three different areas of the whole experience.

1) Concierge, butler, bellmen and valet - Some of the nicest, friendliest and most accommodating employees I have ever dealt with. They are an absolute fabulous. They remember you from one visit to the next and do give you the royal treatment. Love them all.

2) Cleaning service - some of the nicest ladies around, they don't always get it right but they try very hard to please. All I really ask for is a soap bar for my bath and face cloths. On this trip, I had to share with my husband the face cloth on the 4th day we were there. As we were using them, they were not being replaced. They must have had a shortage, same as the perfume satchel for the bath. None available on this trip. They must have had a pillow shortage as well, since they told my husband that he already had 5 pillows on the bed and he did not need another one. So much for the pillow menu.

3) Finally, the in-loft dining service - this is the one section which lowered the rating to average. They must have changed chef since our last visit in April because the whole food experience went from awesome to horrible. Breakfast was cold most of the time, too much pepper on the pre-made potato patties, butter was a solid block and the taking of the order was a hit or a miss on whether they got it right. They insisted on bringing warm water bottles daily with breakfast - don't know why - don't drink warm and didn't order it; ever. But the icing on the cake was breakfast the last morning before check out; there was MOLD on the toast. (see picture below). Turned my whole stomach upside down.
Ordered lunch a couple of times, burgers - ok, sliders - dry, pasta - bland, watery, no taste.

Going back in October, maybe they will have changed the chef by then; because obviously no one is controlling the food quality before it leaves the kitchen.

Too bad the food was the rotten apple that spoiled the whole barrel.</p><br>The Best Experience you can have<p>I had the pleasure of staying at the Skylofts - when I checked in they upgraded me to a two bedroom with a fooseball table - which we used every night. The place is so unbelivabe. You not only feel like royalty you are treated like royalty.The infinity cuzzi tub is so relaxing, the sauna is so wonderful. The staff just makes you feel like a million dollars. I will never stay anywhere else in Vegas. The 2 bedroom , 2 story, 3000 square foot room is number 1. We barely left our room , room service was top notch and the food was yuimmy. We did not want to leave. If you want the best place in Vegas and want to feel Like a King/Queen this is the place to stay.</p><br>The Best Place on the Planet<p>I traveled with friends and stayed at the Skylofts for a few nights. What can I say... WOW! WOW! WOW! Words do not do it justice. All the way from the service to the lofts themselves, the skyloft experience is one I will not forget about ever. I would recommend this property to anyone who wants to do Vegas in style and with peace of mind. I also want to give a special thanks to Aldene, Carmen, Blake and Faith for helping us with our requests, catering to all our needs and also setting up a surprise meeting with David Copperfield after his show!!

Harsatnam Hundal</p><br>The best place ever!!!!<p>This is by far the best place i have ever stayed, its the reason why i have decided to create a trip advisor account.

From the moment me and my friends arrived we were treated like royalty, the service was impeccable and the apartment was amazing!!! Pool table, xbox, cinema room need i say more?

Highly recommend!!! :)
Room Tip: Ask for a room with a view of the strip its a must!!
See more room tips</p><br>Very nice<p>We stayed for three nights and it was amazing. We stayed in a two bedroom with my sister and husband and they were blown away. The fridge was well stocked with what we wanted. All the staff was at your service all the time. Our show tickets were waiting in our room the day of the event and when ordering room service it's almost like eating at a fine dining restaurant. We had the Rolls anytime we wanted, when the women went shopping or if we went to a different casino they were there for us going and coming. I'm not a real big car guy but the way the Rolls rode was amazing, never thought a car could ride like that. Even if the The whole trip wasn't comped I would still pay the price.
Room Tip: Try and get one not to far down the hallway, can be a long walk

Car service to hotel, smooth, quick check in and we are off! I could list out the 485 things that are great, but thing of the best service, the best hotel, the best location. Hear it is! Yeah, gotta eat a Mansion too!</p><br>you have to hit sky lofts!!<p>From the moment you're met at baggage and whisked to the SkyLofts in the Maybach you are transported to a different world. The room is jaw dropping - the infinity tub is filled and waiting, the butler is at your beck and call and the city lays out before you through the two story glass windows. Service throughout is friendly and polished. The best experience ever!! going to go again next year!!</p><br>25th Wedding Anniversary<p>Stayed at the Skylofts for our 25th wedding anniversary and were not disappointed. Once up on the 29th floor it was our sanctuary from the craziness below. The staff are all fantastic. Because we chose to drive in, rather than fly, the concierge was kind enough to set up the Rolls Royce house car for a trip to our anniversary dinner at SW Steakhouse, along with a pick up. There was not one request that wasn't taken care of. Skylofts have earned my loyalty for many trips to come! Cheers!
Room Tip: All rooms have a fantastic view but we especially like the North Strip View.
