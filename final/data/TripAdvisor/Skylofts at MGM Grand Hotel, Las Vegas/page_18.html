<html><head><h3>Skylofts at MGM Grand Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 18</h3></head><body><br>Outstanding<p>I had very high expectations for our first stay at Skylofts. The hotel and staff lived up to all of them. We will definitely return. We were greeted immediately after stepping off the plane by a Skylofts representative and escorted to a new large Rolls Royce (apparently they recently traded in the Maybach mentioned on their website last month for the Rolls). We were taken to the Skylofts entrance and greeted by another representative who showed us around the downstairs lobby and private elevator to our room. He then completed the check-in process in our room very quickly. At the same time our butler arrived and she proceeded to show us around the room, tought us how to use the espresso machine, crestron remote control system, tub, steamroom, etc. As mentioned on the website, she offered to unpack for us but we declined. She then offered to steam press clothes that might have been wrinkled from the suitcase, which we accepted. We left the clothes hanging in the entry way while we stepped out for an hour to check out the rest of the hotel. By the time we returned, the clothes were pressed and hanging back in our closet. They also had a very nice cake waiting for us on the dining room table when we arrived. The concierge took care of all our reservations and everywhere we went (dinners and shows) we received the best seats in the house. The room itself was just as represented on the website, modern, clean, spacious, comfortable. The remote control system is great. Very nice to wake up, push a button to open the shades and see the view of the strip that we had (great view from all the windows by the way). Bathroom and steam shower were amazing. We did have one issue during our second night. The audio stopped working on both bathroom televisions. Not a big deal, but within minutes they had a technical team in the room to fix the problem. We ordered breakfast each morning and it was delivered to the room in less than 20 minutes each time, beautifully prepared and set up by the butler. One night we ordered dinner in the room from Craft Steak. Highly recommend this. After having dinner and wine served in our own comfortable room with great views of the strip, we wondered why we bothered going out for dinner on the prior nights. Bottom line, Skylofts and the staff lived up to everything they promise online. I don't think we can stay anywhere else in Vegas again. If I had to suggest any improvement, the only thing I could think of would be for a dedicated pool for Skyloft guests alone. The Four Season and Wynne have separate dedicated pools, which are very relaxing, quiet and have exceptional service. The only downside to Skylofts is that you have to use the main pool complex. Since we stayed mid-week it was not too crowded, but pool service was still slow and inconsistent. It would be nice to continue the same level of Skylofts service out by the pool.</p><br>Heavenly, Heavenly, Heavenly<p>The experience at the Skylofts at the MGM Grand was exquisite! I have never felt so pampered in my life! We actually had a butler! Can you stand it?????
Our loft was very cool.
My husband surprised me with not 1 but 2 huge Calla Lily arrangements, champagne, chocolate covered strawberries and rose petals strewn on the table.
I was so stunned I started to cry!
If you get the chance to stay at the Skylofts you will NOT be disappointed.
We had breakfast at the Mansions and had the entire restaurant to ourselves. Tre exclusive!!!
We also rode on the elevator with David Copperfield.
Very cool......
Room Tip: Comfortable bed, menu with 14 different pillow choices......Wonderful!!

They offer a private check- in, airport pick up and drop off in a Rolls Royce, Butler Service, Concierge Service, twice daily housekeeping and so much more (your wish is their command). The lofts are spacious and nicely appointed and have lovely views of the Vegas strip. If over-the-top luxury—Vegas Style—is your thing, this is your place. The only negative is that no outside food our alcohol is permitted in your loft so, if you want a cocktail or a glass of champagne, you have to either buy it or be sneaky about it.</p><br>Fabulous Place To Stay In Vegas<p>Our trip to the Skylofts was not without it's bumps, however, the staff was extremely quick to fix any mistake that might have been made. We were greeted at the airport, and she walked us to get our luggage, and escorted us to the waiting limo. The famous Mayback was not available, we were told David Copperfield arrived about 5 minutes before we did, and he took the car. So, I guess David made our car disappear, LOL! Still, the limo was wonderful, and we enjoyed our ride. The driver was friendly, but not intrusive.

The Skylofts has a private entrance, separate from the MGM Grand. We pulled up to it, and everyone knew our name. We were greeted by name from almost every employee. Everyone was super friendly. Our bags were taken to our room, and we were given a tour of the place. Upon going to our room, we met our butler, and we went over the check in, while the butler offered us some homemade juice and offered to make us drinks or unpack our bags. He asked if he could stock anything in our room. Perfection.

Upon unpacking, I saw my flat iron had broken on the trip. We called the desk, and they offered to go get me a new one. I went down to the desk and gave them my broken flat iron, asking to have it replaced identically. When they called me to say it had arrived, I went to the desk and it was the wrong one. I was a little upset, since they had the proper iron in their possession. However, they went back and replaced it with the proper iron, so all good there.

There were a few little bumps in service along the way. For instance, we got a call at 7AM, informing us the cigarettes we ordered had arrived. However, we had not ordered cigarettes, and in fact had placed a noon wake up call, since we were out very late the night before. With the wake up call for noon, obviously, we were planning on sleeping in, so the 7 AM call was not appreciated in the least. And the person who did order the cigarettes was probably unhappy as well, as they clearly had no idea where they were supposed to go. They did apologize profusely, however not much to do to fix that one!

The hotel made all of our reservations for us before we arrived. The MGM is currently home to David Copperfield and we had tickets for his show. We specifically asked about arrival procedures and were told all was taken care of. Our dinner ran close to the show start time, and we went down to the theater to get our tickets. No one knew what was going on down there. Finally had to get a Skylofts manager to come down the locate the tickets for us, and we very nearly missed the beginning of the show. They ended up not charging us for the Copperfield tickets, which was appreciated.

We had tickets another night for a show that was off property and we asked them to go get the tickets for us, so there would not be another issue similar to the Copperfield issue. We were told they do not pick up tickets from other properties. But, they would make an exception for us and go get them. However, they had us sign a form that was for off property tickets, stating we got them. There were multiple names on it, leading us to believe they do actually pick up the tickets, but did not want to. But in the end, we got them. Then the front desk asked us about dinner and the limo. She had caught that the girl who made the reservations did not actually leave us enough time to get from the dinner location to the theater location. I had specifically asked about the time frames when they booked the evening for us, so I was unhappy about it. However, the error was caught, the dinner reservations moved up, and no harm came from the mix up.

One day, we had a do not disturb on our door, and came out of the shower to find two people in our room! They had to be asked twice to leave, perhaps due to language barrier, as they barely spoke English. Again, not an issue that can be corrected, however everyone was very apologetic.

But, we'd come back. They did offer us some money off of our room for all of our troubles. However, that is not really the point. At this level of hotel, you expect impeccable service. But, everything settled down in the end, and we would certainly give them another chance.

They did cater to our every whim, bringing drinks before dinner, delivering Wolfgang Puck to our room in the middle of the night, keeping the room stocked with all our favorite items. Every day they made the room up, and once even organized my make up case! I had been in a hurry getting ready and dumped it out in the sink to find something. When I came back to the room, it was all returned to the case! They will iron your clothes, bring you snacks, anything you can think of.

They allowed us to stay in the room several hours after check out time, due to our very late flight out of Vegas, which was very nice. They also held our luggage all day.

Even after our return home, the service continued. My husband had bought a lighter that he loved so much, he wanted a spare. He called Skylofts and they went to purchase the lighter and shipped it to our home in PA.

We will definitely be back to Skylofts! On a scale of 1-5, we'd give them a 4.9. Despite our issues, we do not feel we'd recieve anywhere near the level of service at any other Vegas property. They are helpful and eager to correct issues, and we believe they learn from each experience. This place will only get better!</p><br>Gorgeous room but not amazing*<p>We had high expectations of skylofts. I wasn't disappointed, it delivered what it said on the label but...mmm...can put my finger on it...there was just something missing. A butler we rarely saw..staff, nice enough but not particularly personal..it felt exclusive but a little cold...it could be far more chic and whereas its pretty cool...it could be cooler in a warmer way!! We enjoyed our stay but it just wasn't the amazing end to our California experience.. Maybe look around an see what their rates will get you elsewhere...</p><br>2nd Trip and a Much Much Better Stay<p>My wife and I stayed at the Skylofts back in 2007. I did not give a bad review before, but there were some items lacking that I would have really expected out of a 5 diamond hotel.
On our second stay the staff was spectacular. They were literally there for everything you could possibly need. There were some items I left at home by accident and without any prompting the staff delivered them free of charge. They insisted on handling all reservations and as a result we received the best seating available everywhere we went. On 2 occasions we were extended an invitation to have breakfast in the MGM Mansion’s which was a real treat.

Any request was treated as a priority and any “to do” items were taken off of our hands. This staff has really stepped up its game, and this is exactly what you should expect from a 5 star staff.</p><br>Come back Skylofts service, please come back.....<p>This is my second review and fourth stay at Skylofts. I’m sad to say but things were a bit off on this trip. Is this a bad sign for the future of this great property or was it just a fluke?

I booked a one night (mid-week) stay in July on the way back from CA for some business meetings. One of my employees was traveling with me and deserved a bonus for outstanding work. I chose Skylofts, as I knew that he would be impressed. Here are a few of the issues with the stay.

They are one of the only properties I know that can still actually meet you at the airport gate with a sign. Before leaving CA I called the concierge and asked them to change the last name on that sign to reflect my employee’s name. Staying at Skylofts was a surprise and I thought that would be a cool touch. He was seated ahead of me in the plane so he would see it first and it would make for a fun photo. Somehow they failed to get that changed. It was just a minor detail that I'd let slip however it was a sign of things to come.

Room upgrade policy. I had booked via AMEX Platinum Travel desk as they have a relationship with this hotel that offers discounts and room upgrades when available. Let me clarify that the automatic upgrade (if available) that AMEX had guaranteed is flat out lie. This is just NOT the case. I had booked a one bedroom and asked for a roll a way bed. Not only did we not get the upgrade to a 2 bedroom but also we had to ask for the roll a way three times before it arrived. That is poor for the typical Skylofts service.

Later that night I asked why we were not offered the upgrade to a 2 bedroom. They explained that one was not available that night. I pulled out my computer and showed them that this was not the case as I could clearly book 2 bedroom units right now.

Then she explained that it was actually because we had a 4pm late checkout guarantee (AMEX deal) and that tomorrow night they were fully committed. I could see where that would put them in a difficult position. It was a legitimate concern and I offered to be out of the room early. She declined. After a few clicks I showed her that I was also able to book a 2 bedroom for the following night. After a moment of concern she finally quietly explained that they almost never upgrade a one bedroom guest to a two bedroom unit however on occasion a 2 bedroom guest will get upgraded to one of the three bedroom units. That is a very deceptive practice and contradictory to the AMEX statements.

I am pleased to say that the rooms still looked good however there were some issues with the Crestron system that could use some attention. Also they never checked towels or refreshed the room when we went out that night. Perhaps they borrowed the training manuals from their sister property the Red Roof Inn! That is really poor service for this level of hotel.

The bill was wrong at check out and it took almost 20 minutes to correct the mistakes. To top it all off when we went downstairs they had us listed as a party of 4 for return transfer to the airport. Again sloppy as this was not possible given that we were booked in a one bedroom! This mistake signaled the transportation department to pull the ugly gold colored MGM limo out instead of the sleek Maybach. That was the final letdown and likely a clear response to my upgrade inquiries. The driver was very polite and offered to change cars but the damage was done, and due to the time it took to resolve the billing issues, we could not wait for him to change cars.

I still consider it a great deal at $510 per night and enjoyed my stay. If you have never been there and are considering a trip I urge you to book the room right now! You will likely be impressed.

The point is that "you pay for what you get" and "you get what you pay for" in life. It is very clear that the former standards and excellent service at Skylofts has taken a severe hit since my last visit. Perhaps it is due to added competition or the lower room prices. It appears that some of those awesome employees who helped this property stand out have clearly left the building!

Finally it was likely my last ride in a Maybach as the driver explained that the leases are up. Apparently they will be changing to a Rolls Ghost. I am sure that it is an awesome car but there was something special about arriving in the Maybach.</p><br>Amazing...lavish. Amazingly lavish!<p>We booked a Skyloft with two other couples for our last night in Vegas. Where to start? Everything was amazing. The suite was HUGE. Two levels, giant windows (remote-controlled, of course), three living rooms, three bathrooms, a pool-table. Absolutely gorgeous.

The staff were amazing too. The butler never intruded, but was there whenever we needed her. They were also good about turning a blind eye to our additional guests who stayed the night.

In the morning, they took us to the airport in a gold limo. Yeah...it was great.</p><br>Totally Vegas, totally over the top!<p>Stayed at the SkyLofts with my wife and two teenage daughters. It was completely over-the-top Vegas but in a tasteful way. Greeted at the airport gate, escorted to baggage claim, hopped in a $300,000 car for the ride to the hotel. Private entry to the hotel and everyone knew our names. By the time we got to the room, at least five people had helped us.

We’ve stayed in a lot of very nice places but never have I heard so may “oh my God’s” as they explored the two-bedroom loft suite. The butler showed them around while I did paperwork with the concierge. They had fresh juice (watermelon, orange, mango…and it certainly wasn’t from a bottle) and some snacks waiting for us. The tour of the room took about 10 minutes. Amazing Crestron electronic controls, nine televisions (two in each bathroom, of course), home theater speakers in one of the lounge areas and each bedroom, top of the line amenities, a shower in which you could have a party for six, closets bigger than some NYC hotel rooms, Capresso espresso maker, excellent linens – the list just goes on and on. My daughter made a video tour of the suite – it took seven minutes to highlight everything.

The staff was excellent and very professional. They know your name and were always cheerful and ready to help. We didn’t use the butler service very much but he was excellent and on top of things. Whenever we left, someone came in to straighten up/freshen up. No one-time turndown service at this place.

The billing between the SkyLofts and MGM isn’t always seamless but they quickly rectified some charge discrepancies.

One example of the service. We had to leave very early (5:00 am) for a Grand Canyon trip. Want your breakfast set up in your suite at 4:15 am? No problem. The butler let himself in, set the dining area, had all the food ready then called us in our bedrooms for a wake-up call. A beautiful breakfast awaited us. He took our bags down while we ate and had them in the limo waiting for us to depart. You are the rock star at the SkyLofts.

Clearly, the SkyLofts are built for parties but it was very quiet. We saw some people coming and going to a few suites but they monitor who arrives and guests have to be registered. I’m sure it could easily get out of control.

I wasn’t sure what we would get when reserving the SkyLofts but it exceeded my expectations. The combination of location, room, staff and service makes it one of a kind. Rooms can be reasonably priced - they have specials and we paid less than the price of two rooms at the Mandarin. With the Amex Platinum upgrade, you can get quite a place. You really forget you are on top of the gigantic, frenetic MGM Grand hotel. It’s there if you want it but can be avoided as well.

If alone, the SkyLofts would feel a bit lonely but if you have a family or group, it’s awesome.</p><br>Great Hotel<p>Just wonderful, very helpful and the rooms are just great</p><br></body></html>
