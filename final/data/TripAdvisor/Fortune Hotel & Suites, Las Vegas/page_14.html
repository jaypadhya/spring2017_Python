<html><head><h3>Fortune Hotel & Suites, Las Vegas Reviews Page 14</h3></head><body><br>Why???<p>Deserves a zero. In all categories. Webooked it on hotwire and were immediately regretful when we saw what it was. I knew even before we got there to check in. Its in a seedy area, cheap nasty room, broken pool. Now, our neighbor had his do not disturb sign up and at 11 pm he starts singing loudly. He also had his tv on and the walls are paper thin. Then we proceed to a night long event of him calling hookers. And hes still going well into 10am!!!! I did not get any sleep. We had a 2 yr old with. Worst motel ever. Next to a strip club.</p><br>Good thing it was cheap<p>We arrived early evening to the hotel. There were 5 adults and 2 children in our group. I had booked 2 rooms each with 2 queen beds. The girl at the desk gave us keys to our two rooms and we drove around back to the building with the rooms. There was really no easy way to get luggage up to the rooms other than carrying them. We were shocked to find our rooms were occupied!! Back down to the desk. The girl at the desk blamed "Booking.Com". At this point, regardless of who's fault it was, she should have been working on getting us accommodations rather than assigning blame. So after about an hour, we finally had rooms. Apparently she was annoying people all night, as we spoke with a few other staff members who were very upset with her. So, the rooms were "okay", old furniture, old tv, bathroom was not attractive. The pool and weight room looked nice, the lobby was nice. The shuttle driver was friendly enough. The evening security guard was very helpful in getting us a wheelchair - my niece hurt her knee when we were down visiting the strip. The only really good thing about the hotel was the adjoining door in the rooms so that we could all fell as we were "together".
Room Tip: Be prepared to carry your luggage. Room #'s are confusing. You need to carry your room key wit...
See more room tips</p><br>very poorly managed<p>as others have said, there was only one person doing check-ins and she was unprofessional- talking to co-workers about where they'd party that night instead of paying attention to her job. also, my booking with priceline/booking wasn't in their system but they did honor the price. even the manager was unprofessional, yelling at the employees.

the room was large. fridge worked ok. the tv remote was only programmed for 8 channels- later found out that there were at least 40 channels if you manually input the channel on the remote.

the carpet was filthy and stained. recliner, loveseat and sofa were filthy so i wouldn't sit on them. the deska nd chair were fine as was the bed.

breakfast was strange- boiled eggs and frozen hashbrown potatos with large ketchup bottles, very stale bread, waffles and cold cereal, watermelon- trying to cater to a chinese crowd.

best thing was the low rate on a weekend.</p><br>Nice stay but inconvenient at checking in<p>Had a nice stay overall but checking in was really inconvenient as the computer system was down and finally managed to check in after nearly 3 hours as checking system was manual , the room where we were allocated in was not cleaned and we had to move to another room, finally afte 4 hours we managed to rest , the final room was great</p><br>Only for the weekends when all the good hotels in the strip are very expensive.<p>This hotel is only a good option only during the weekend when all the excellent hotels in the strip cost more than the average 65 $ than they cost during the weekdays.
The hotel is not so bad, but it is awfully managed. You ALLWAYS and repit ALLWAYS have to wait at least 1 hour before you get a room no matter you have booked or not. They don´t know which room is open or which one is not. After one hour waiting they can send to a room with people inside. It´s a mess, they don´t even know if you have paid or not.
After all the adventure in the checking, the hotel is quite right, almost clean rooms, and pretty good facilities. The pool was being upgraded when I was there but it looked great.
The hotel is about 20 minutes walking to the Flamingo (the closest point in the sprip) and can be a long walk back to the hotel after having been all the day casino-hopping.
The breakfast is a poor self service with some boiled eggs, toasts and fresh fruit. The best is the machine to make your own whaffles, but unfortunatelly there is always a 10 to 20 minutes queue before you can use it.
This hotel is not a bad option if you can not find another cheap hotel, but it never would be my first option.
It is not necesary to book it in advance, because if you just drive your way into the free parking, you can find a room as low as 35 $ (an a big sign announces) that is almost half the price i paid by the internet.</p><br>Don't reserve it's regretful and awful!!!<p>We, 14 guests in a group stayed from Oct 11 to 13, all saying this hotel is the baddest and worst of hotels and will never again stay in this rude, untrained and unresponsive staffs except the Security & Housekeeping personnel. The following discrepancies are listed with our nightmare experiences: 1. There's is no in-house Manager 2. The Lobby receptionists are rude and non customer-oriented service personnel, her named is "SHERRIE" AND OTHERS, are talking with each other like one inside the booth and one outside like a customer. They never "meet and greet" their customers, never say please and thank you. 3. Charged us $10 for resort fees but pool is closed. 3. Some Rooms and building key locks not working like in bldg 3100"s, I complained about the room twice not working and ask what's the cause?, Lobby Receptionist replied rudely (a) I won't know until you bring your key here (b) I don't know maybe your key is demagnetized. (instead of sending repairman to check my room). 4. Breakfast room is completely disarray, one person took the whole bowl of boiled eggs and no one is checking or supervising if guests eating are really residents. 5. My friend lost her wallet after check-out, i called "sherrie or sherry" to please check her room, because we were already @ the Whiskey Pete area, but she never called back until my friend went back to her room and luckily found her wallet. 6. OVERALL RATING IS MINUS ZERO. PLEASE CANCEL YOUR RESERVATION NOW! UNTIL THE OWNER OR MANAGER CORRECT ITS HOTEL PROBLEMS OTHERWISE U WILL SURELY REGRET IT!! -my name is jimmy D from San Diego, Ca.
Room Tip: retrain and rehire your staffs and fire those unworthies...
See more room tips</p><br>Sorry I am staying here.<p>I checked in and was immediately regretful that I was doing so. As soon as I arrived I learned that not only was the pool closed for "upgrades" but the fitness center...the one amenity I actually care about..was closed too. Staff at the desk said a guest broke something so its closed. What? The whole center closed due to one piece of equipment being broken? BS excuse in my opinion. The website us false advertising as it shows a nice pool and fitness center and neither are operational. Room is clean...very small and in some disrepair in bathroom. I wish I could go stay somewhere else right now..</p><br>Doesn't even deserve a one should be a zero<p>What a let down, this place is just plain baaad. Pool and jacuzzi were closed for health reasons. Staff showed very little concern and good luck getting the front desk to answer the phone. Very very run down with an eyesore, vacant shabby looking hotel just to the east of this hotel. This was our view out of our window in the morning (not pleasant to look at...better to have kept the drapes closed). Hall in one of the buildings smelled like a smokey bar. Dirty rooms without any coffee, tea or even a tissue box. Charged deposit fee of $100.00 for any missing items. Room had 2 bath towels that were very old along with 1 hand towel and 1 washcloth. Pillow cases were very worn. Just an unpleasant experience in all. This hotel will soon look like the one that it faces...vacant because of poor management and upkeep. All I can say is good luck if you decide to stay here.
Room Tip: There are no good rooms...stay away from this hotel.
See more room tips</p><br>so bad<p>My colleagues and I stayed overnight in this hotel. The good thing is that we just stayed overnight in this hotel. Well the bad thing is that we still stayed in this crappy hotel..even for a short time.

Front desk was so slow. It was so tiring specially after a long flight. Some of my colleagues didn't even get a room immediately, after getting confirmation from the internet weeks ahead of our arrival. They only got their room at midnight.

Breakfast was lousy and cold.

don't even try to go to this place.</p><br>Don't ever stay here...<p>Dirty. Given another persons room. Hall reaked of smoke. Garbage bags all around the garbage container by the elevator. Staff did try...Chinese owner will be informed of our displeasure. Oh also, pool & jacuzzi were closed as well...</p><br></body></html>
