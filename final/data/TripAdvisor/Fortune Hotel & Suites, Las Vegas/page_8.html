<html><head><h3>Fortune Hotel & Suites, Las Vegas Reviews Page 8</h3></head><body><br>January 2015 visit<p>I had previously booked 8 rooms in order to attend the German carnival next door at the Tuscany Suites. No problem booking and had to cancel 2 rooms. Amy at the front desk was very helpful and no problems checking into rooms. Each room was a little different - we were on the third floor There were 10 of us in the group (9 Germans and myself being English)! My husband was 85 on the Saturday and we celebrated in room 1317 which had an extra sofa and chair. For the price quoted by the Manager of $59 per room, plus tax, the hotel was a bargain. Yesterday I talked to the Mark, the Manager, and have booked 6 rooms for next year in January.
Room Tip: Rooms on the 3rd floor are large enough with fridge etc. and have great views of the Linq wheel whic...

I was here once before For Valentines day and I had a great stay, the front desk girl I cant remember her name I think it was Amber, (small little red headed girl) even gave me a free upgrade for the holiday. But this time it was like once you pass the lobby everything goes down hill. The rooms are dirty. there was a hair and what looked like a pee stain. I told the front desk and the little indian boy was busy flirting with another guy who was checking in. he didn't know what to do he said he had to call his manager. Speaking of the staff. the front desk girls were horrible. the blonde girl who checked me out had a horrible attitude. she looked like she rolled out of bed. the Chinese girl who checked us in was on her phone and the most rudiest person ive ever came across at a front desk. I asked for a manager and I was told there is no managers. What hotel doesnt have a manager. WHAT A JOKE!! DO NOT STAY HERE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! They treat you like dog crap and the room wasn't even worth it even though it was only 30 buck!!!!!!</p><br>Don't stay here at the shower doesn't even work<p>This place doesn't even deserve a one. We rented this room because my mother was in the hospital and it was cheap. The grounds are beautiful the lobby is pretty but as soon as you go to where the actual rooms are the carpet start showing stains and wear. The rooms were disgusting the carpets were stained there was some staining on the walls that we were not sure what it was. Or shower wouldn't even turn on in the morning only went to take a shower. When we brought our complaints to the front desk they basically told us to get over it that we'd stay the night. Then manager hung up on us when we called back this place needs to be shut down for health code violations.</p><br>Dirty hotel needs a lot of change<p>I had high hopes for this hotel. I saw the reviews and can't really blame them as its my fault for booking after seeing all the complaints about this hotel on here and Expedia. I figured I would give the place the benefit of the doubt an some people expect the world from a low budget place.

I was poorly mistaken and should have trusted my judgement. It started out by long lines to check in. Dirty carpets, dirty stained sheets, moldy bathroom, broken locks on doors, missing security, no towels brought when asked. The whole place smells like a bathroom and it probably was from the bums hanging out.

The biggest issue I had with the place was I cannot blame the staff. I work in a hotel myself in California and the 3 night I was at this place I saw the same 4 staff doing everything. The 1 cleaning guy I saw did carpets, changed garbage's, brought supplies, cleaned the pool, this guy was trying to do everything. I saw the same thing with every employee. The front desk same issue, The long lines I was not going to yell at the poor front desk girl like the other people because it was not her fault. The manager should have been working the front desk apologizing for not knowing how to run a hotel!

So bottom line avoid this place at all cost. The staff was great and you guys are doing a great job .</p><br>It was cheap<p>I slept & showered. I saw no casino. It's mostly parking lot and old buildings with old rooms. I paid $22 to Hotels.com plus the $10 "resort fee" at check-in.

I never found a resort. I didn't look for the free continental breakfast. I think the wi-fi worked.

The guy at the desk was friendly. The guy who knocks on doors to remind people to leave was neither friendly nor unfriendly. Fair's fair, I slept past check-out time. But considering it's Vegas, check-out shouldn't be 11 a.m.

It's east of the Strip, not really near it, which is fine for me. There's a Starbucks directly across the street.
Room Tip: i asked for a top floor (of three) room, and the guy at the front desk made it happen. I don't l...

My a/c is on now and working perfect. Best free breakfast maybe ever.I had pancakes, a boiled egg, rice in my cocoa puffs, toast and they even put out an Indian pepper dish of somekind that makes my mouth water now, quite delish. The oranges were super sweet. I am going to the pool after I bring my gf here from the airport. They have a shuttle but I have a car and its close. So far extremely happy. They are remodelling areas and doing a good job. 'A' for effort.</p><br>Uncomfortable<p>The staff showed little concerned at the fact that somebody tried to break into my room. They moved me and my wife to another room that wasn't any better than the previous one, the a/c didn't blow good at all, things were broken and the bedding was not the cleanest but we decided to keep room on the strength that we didn't dornd much time in there!.. This hotel has so much more potential but no effort. As an employee of a hotel in a military base this place would be totally unacceptable. I wish you guys luck in the future with this place.</p><br>Good price, silent and relaxing<p>If you are after a place with good price and don't want to be in crowd and gambling space, it could be your choice. Nice pool and jacuzzi. One of the staff in reception was not friendly enough but the others are nice and welcoming. Refrigerator in room was a good point and also there is safety box. Free wifi. Towels don't seem new and need to be renewed. With a little bit paying attention and investing, the hotel could be much more pleasant for passengers. The maneger is a helpful guy and friendly. There is out of charge business center in lobby too. At all, the hotel worked for me due to my purpose of stay.</p><br>Bad Experience<p>I just checked out from this hotel, upon check in I had the following experiences:
1- Very tricky entrance
2- I was in line for 5 minutes with only one poor agent that handled the desk by herself
3- Another lady seemed to be a supervisor noticed me and offered help
4- I was given a room 31** I was given the key without directions, and when I asked where is my room the answer was "just pass the pool area and it will be there"
5- Got lost in the area for a while and I had to come back and Jorge the maintenance guy offered 10 times more help than the "lady in Black".
6- I managed to get to the room after a long and hard try, it was filthy, image do not match advertised pictures online, sheets were crumbled in a way I can tell it was used by the previous guest, torn carpet and dirty, stuffy and smelly room.
7- I returned back to the desk and the other lady changed the room to give me one in the ground floor, better than the other one, still a stuffy smell with a broken kitchenette door and stained towels, hot water took forever to get there, TV was dish network with almost all commercial advertising channels no premium channels, AC unit is noisy and rattles.
We almost spent the night at the strip and came back to sleep for a couple of hours, the back door did not open with my keys we had to turn around the entire building to get in it was cold.
8- Breakfast was a joke and staff was not polite, it was pass 7 yet they treated my wife as if she was not entitled to have one at 7:05 AM still not ready.
Room Tip: Good location, bad rooms, needs some remodeling and staff for sure needs training how to be hospitab...
