<html><head><h3>Fortune Hotel & Suites, Las Vegas Reviews Page 13</h3></head><body><br>Never again!<p>My family and I stayed here last weekend. The location was nice and lobby was great. It ends there. The receptionist took forever checking us in. In that time she had calls and was making remarks about the man calling that was unprofessional. Then sent us to the wrong room! The lady in there was kind enough to let us use the phone,but was put on hold for 5 minutes. So we walked out with my 7 month old baby and 8 year old in the wind and rain back to the lobby. She laughed it off then said "oh opps wrong keys". I was very upset after traveling for 4 hours to run around finding our room. The room when u walked in smelled like smoke. The duvet was stained with bleach and was wrinkley. The sheets were disgusting and dingey looking. YUCK. Then breakfast boiled eggs and hashbrowns...it was just gross and disappointing.
My husband and I was very disappointed for a 3 star motel.</p><br>Wouldn't recommend unless your budget is really low<p>I stayed at this place for three nights.
I needed to go reception every night when I wanna go back to my room because two of my room cards were not working, which was really frustrated.
I lost my swarovski watch at this hotel. I left it inside of my bag when I went out and when I returned, it was gone. What could I say to management since I had no proof?
When I arrived in San Diego the day I checked out, I found that I lost my ice lunch bag in the refrigerator. I called the hotel and told them to see if I could get my bag back. A girl who answered the phone said she would report and call me back if the clean team found the bag. No responses at all.</p><br>IF ONLY I COULD RATE THIS HOTEL AS ZERO, THEN IT MUST BE<p>Ramada/Fortune is ever the worst place to stay. The informations particularly on its rate is severely deceiving. I made a call just an hour prior to my arrival and I was informed that a night stay would be $79 + tax. My friend and myself checked in at around 2am for an overnight stay. The staff confirmed on the room rate as I was informed over the phone. Payment was made by my friend who was so tired from our earlier travel had inadvertently paid with her credit card and signed the paper without reading. She did not give us our copy of the signed paper. On checking out, a final statement on our bill was requested from the staff and we were aghast to discover that the rate came up to the total of more than double the amount as given to us. It was a clear case of deception!!!! A clear robbery of the tired and sleepy custometrs!!! The staff on the front desk told us that the rates would always vary and that it is always high during the weekend. Huh???? We checked in at 2am of Monday which is definitely not a weekend.. The breakfast sucks with everything cold. No oven to warm the foods, empty containers, cold already made waffles. Foods were serve with lack of sanitation, breakfast area was dark and poor service by the attendant for assist. The bed was poorly made up as if somebody had just used it and was hurriedly covered. The toilet bowl had rings of dirt already accumulating around it which simply indicate that it has not been cleaned for weeks. the towels are yellowish in color and should have been due to be disposed. Surely, this bad review on this hotel would continue by words of mouth and would be a big help on the part of the hotel to have customers stay away from it. In conclusion, This hotel definitely sucks!!!! Next, the Consumers Affair......
Room Tip: This hotel is not worth spending even just for a night stay.

The rest of the weekend we planned on staying in a time share. We checked in late so the lobby we completely empty. The outside of the hotel looked simple and upon entering the lobby it appeared to be pretty nice. As we approached the front desk the agent didn’t bother to make eye contact from the time we entered until I walked up to the counter and had to say hello first. She was not at all friendly or even cracked a smile. So we headed to our room and I was hoping the room would be as nice as the lobby area. We entered the room and I was disappointed. There was no coffeemaker, which was supposedly included. Bathroom was clean and carpet looked new but still felt dingy. I hated the dark green comforter which felt dirty. I would prefer to have a white one so you can at least see if it’s actually clean. Luckily my friend and I were so tired we went right to sleep. Unfortunately I was woken early in the morning due to the plumbing. I could hear both my neighbors showers going on which was pretty loud, then the darn pigeons which decided to perch rich outside our windows. Since we were up we decided to get dressed and check out the continental breakfast, OMG…seriously paper plates and plastic utensils? I refrained from laughing out loud but remained calm. The breakfast consisted of eggo like waffles, hard boiled eggs (in a shell), toast, I think sausage, hashbrowns and cereal. Everything was cold and the buffet table was dirty. The orange juice and apple juice was labeled with masking tape which looked pretty tacky. I felt as if we were at a soup line in a homeless shelter, but honestly I’ve volunteered many times at my local shelter and the food and presentation is much better. Once we finished our breakfast we decided to hurry up back to our room and get ready to check out. I decided to turn on the TV while and low and behold a “Hotel Impossible” commercial on the Travel Channel came on and surprise surprise, the Fortune Hotel is the featured property! While the did a nice renovation job in the lobby they neglected the guestrooms, breakfast area and teaching the staff better customer service, I guess I got what I paid for.</p><br>Terrible<p>When we arrive we explained and showed them the expedia booking .They still charged us again for the room. You hsd to fight for it back . If they dobthis for every one what a profit margin if people don't bother .we finally got the money back then they asked for 58 dollar deposit and a 10 dollar resort fee.wow The carpet in the rooms and where we ate were disgusting. The service was slow hardly a two star hotel.The breakfast consisted of running eggs and crapt stale bread.</p><br>Nothing Wrong Here!<p>So, I booked this on Hotwire.com. We live in Northern Utah, and my mom and brother were coming home from Southern California. I got a call from the road saying they were beat and just needed a place to stay. It was 7 PM so I figured I could get a good last minute deal in Vegas, which is the halfway point home.

So I got on hotwire found a room on a blind bid 2.5 Stars, Free breakfast, free parking and free internet for $23 a night after fees and taxes $33 So, I booked two rooms Then I got Fortune, read the reviews and was worried that I was sending my family to a roach coach!

(SIDEBAR: I spent my first 8 years of life in a house that was adjacent to the motel my parents owned and operated. It was clean and safe, but it was just a motel nothing fancy. A place to sleep off of the highway. So when I see bad reviews for a hotel, I think people must be expecting the Waldorf for $23 a night and get upset when they get a clean place to sleep, maybe needing some updates, maybe some older towels and lumpy pillows, maybe an older model a/c, and no flat screen tv or DVD player, but totally fine.)

My mom said it was great! Older furnishings, but it was clean, the bathroom was small but it worked. The breakfast was basic but good , the TV selection was fine and the internet suited their needs. All they needed was a bed. If you are looking for amenities and entertainment, then you will want the strip, and you can pay the strip prices. But if you want a place to crash after playing on the strip, this place works just fine. My mom has stayed in 5 star amenities and has stayed in 1 star amenities and her words "It was great!" On her tight budget she would have been mad at me if I booked a more expensive room. She also said at check out that I would be getting a refund. Some Hotwire deal...so their rooms would only a total of $20 Don't know how that works, or if my mom didn't hear right or if we won some hot wire prize. Either way a $40 refund or to pay the $64 we got a nice deal!

(PS I have stayed in 5 stars amenities and hostels in Europe, I guess I am either not too fussy or people are too critical. When I am on vacation, I am out seeing the sights and just need a bed and a shower..If I want a little luxury, and plan on relaxing at the hotel, or want a pool, spa, on site hotel, gift shop, golf course I book a hotel who has those things..)</p><br>sucks but super cheap<p>um its pretty bad. but i didn't any roaches so that was a positive. staff is soooo rude and need serious customer service training. i'd only recommend if you are on super super tight budget...i walked in the room and wanted to walk right back out lol
Room Tip: maybe the rooms actually in the hotel where the front desk would be better. they put us in a far bac...

This one is about two blocks away from the Strip but within walking distance of the Silver Sevens and Hard Rock casinos.

Strengths:
-Affordable
-Attractive lobby
-Spacious breakfast area with plenty of seating
-Pool
-No smoky casino
-Can park near your room
-Housekeeping was responsive to requests for additional towels and soaps
-No problem with the wireless internet, even on a Saturday night
-Breakfast included toast, bagels, cereal, hardboiled eggs, juice, coffee and milk
-Room had refrigerator and bar sink (a small sink separate from the bathroom sink)

Needs
-The parking lot needs better lighting.
-The area surrounding the hotel feels very dark and isolated at night, not conducive to walking
-The bar sink in our room was difficult to operate and the faucet had a leak
-The front desk was usually staffed only by one person and the service was indifferent. Requesting something meant either waiting on the phone or waiting in person.
-It was tight navigating the stroller in and out of the room

It was apparent that this is an older hotel that has been painted and given new carpet, but the makeover was quick and not very thorough. Wall patches could be seen under the paint, the quality of the paint job was fair, and the finishes looked cheap.

Overall, the best things about staying here were:
-Free internet
-Free breakfast
-Low price

If those are not your priorities, consider other options.
Room Tip: Ask for a room on the main floor.

I stayed in room #1311 one night in November 2013 as a single guest. CONDITION OF ROOM: Dingy carpet (I kept my socks on), dilapidated furniture, old windows, street noise. Towels were old, but clean. Bed was clean, though the mattress was older and had lost some of its resiliency. Bedspread was old, but appeared probably safe to lay on. Shower was good -- hot water and strong pressure. Toilet in good, clean working order. TV was on old box, but had clear picture with 60 channels and clean functioning remote. SERVICE: Housekeepers did a great job, given the worn out rooms they have to work with. Front desk clerks are polite, but either have poor training or outdated technology. Check in and check out were painfully slow. Long lines. Clerks tried hard, but appeared frustrated. My check-in clerk had a cold with sniffles, and coughed on my drivers license, credit card, and room key. IN CONCLUSION: Looks pretty on the outside -- until you walk in the room. You get what you pay for. Cheap lodging close the Strip? YES. Deluxe accommodations? NO. Will the room be clean? ROLL THE DICE. Friendly staff, YES. Sophisticated lodging? NO. Free WiFi, YES (but slow). Stay here if you can handle a step down from a name-brand motel chain, but want easy walking to the Strip and need a step up from a youth hostel. TIP: Check out well before 11:00am. The clerks cannot handle the pace of the 11am rush. Next time I'll splurge and stay at a hotel with a better reputation.
Room Tip: When you book the room, ask if any of the rooms have been recently remodeled. If the answer is &quo...
See more room tips</p><br>okay for 1 night<p>We arrived at 11pm, checked in quick and went to sleep. The room was older, but looked clean. Breakfast was 2 cold cereals, toast, make your own waffles, hard boiled eggs, hash browns, honeydew melon, apple juice and orange DRINK. Check out was quick and we were on our way. The roll away was free. This is a nonsmoking, non casino hotel. Easy parking out front and about a 1 minute walk from our car to the room. Yes it is near a 'gentleman's' club, but what in Las Vegas isn't near some vice. Easy access to the Interstate. It appears they are doing some renovations
Room Tip: This hotel is actually 3 separate buildings
