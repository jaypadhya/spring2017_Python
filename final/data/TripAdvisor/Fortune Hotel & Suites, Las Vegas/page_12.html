<html><head><h3>Fortune Hotel & Suites, Las Vegas Reviews Page 12</h3></head><body><br>Cheap hotel/ horrible customer service<p>Our experience was not great during our stay. We got sent to a used uncleaned room at first. The customer service was not recognized. Everyone lives and learns. We just learned to not stay there again.</p><br>Horrible Experience<p>Unfortunately, I did not have a pleasant experience while staying at Fortune Hotel, it was very unfortunate. My sheets were dirty with hair, soiled spots, and other items on my 1st night there. the front deskntold me they did not have the keys to get clean sheets so I ended up sleeping one one small section that appeared half way decent. The pictures of the hotel on the Internet were misleading and the continental breakfast the hotel boasted about ended up being dry toast, hard boiled eggs and cold ego waffles.</p><br>My visit in Hotel without Casino<p>As Einstein said: I seek to take out of the opportunities of the problems. I realy hope that the hotel go getting better every time I visit it. I have never had problems with the staff and the services. I would like to ask for include bacon, sausage and different eggs for the breakfast. I really doesn't like the casino and this hotel is a special place to go.
Room Tip: Ask for the room with King Size bed.
See more room tips</p><br>Good<p>Stayed for only one night after we run out of choices due to the very short notice period. One of the main advantage is the location as the hotel is very close to Las Vegas strip (5 mins walk to Caesars palace and Bellagio) .
The room was spacious and clean but again due to the last moment reservation it was very overpriced.
The overall experience was nice but that was my first stay at Vegas so I can't compare it with the other Hotels in Vegas.</p><br>Cheap clean awesome location<p>I paid $25 a night stayed 4/11 -4/13....expected no luxuries and basic amentities...room was clean and big..looks like a apartment complex and everything is self service..i would stay again for the cheap and clean price</p><br>Don't even think about it<p>We arrived at the hotel on April 3rd around 11:00pm. They first gave us an occupied room, so we disturbed some people that where sleeping! I returned to the front desk to gently complain about the situation, they gave us no apology just an other card.
The hotel has been making charges to my credit card until this day. They say its their new software fault but they have not returned the hundreds of dollars they charged me, who do they try to fool? Im taking legal action against fraudulent charges as of now.

Avoid this hotel at al costs.</p><br>Turned away although prepaid<p>After midnight on the night of April 11, 2014 my wife, 9 year old child and I arrived at the Fortune Hotel to secure our prepaid room that I had confirmed directly with the hotel only to be told that they had no record of our reservation and no rooms were available. Another party was also being turned away at the same time. A bouncer was stationed at the desk to remove anyone who protested. I have no idea if this is a good place to stay but if you want to be sure that you have a room I recommend making a reservation elsewhere. If you do decide to make one here all I can say is good luck.
Room Tip: If you want a real reservation make one elsewhere.

We got into Las Vegas Airport at 1040pm and we called the hotel as soon as our plane landed so we could have the shuttle there to pick us up on time. We were told it would take about a half hour and that they would call us once they were on their way. Once we got off the plane we waited and waited for the shuttle after 45 minutes of waiting, we called again and we're put on hold for over ten minutes before we could even ask where the shuttle was. Then my husband hung up and called again before they could put us on hold again he asked where the shuttle was and they said he had to pick up two big parties and it would be another 15 minutes and they would call. So again we waited about 20 minutes and called them again they told us it would be another 15 minutes, we said screw it and then we got a taxi.
We got to the hotel and checked in quickly. Our rooms weren't next to each other though which was odd since we booked them at the same time. Our room was nothing spectacular but it worked. The sheets were stained which was gross. There was no hotel "welcome binder" that most places have. They didn't have a list of tv channels, local restaurants or anything like that. Our hotel room did not have a coffee pot like most places.
Our towels were towels that I wouldn't even use on my dogs, I would cut them up and use them as rags. Some days our towels smelt like cigarettes. Out of the five days we stayed there they made our bed once. My father in law's room wasn't cleaned until 530pm, when they were in the room so they just changed the towels out, never offered to make the beds.
The breakfast sucked. We ate there one day and the other days we walked over to the Tuscany and got extremely good food there. We went to the pool one day. My husband went over to get a towel and their pool towel rack (which was four shelves high) was completely empty. I paid attention to this every day and would look to see if there were towels there other days as we walked passed-there were never any towels there.
Our bathroom door had a hole in it. My father in law's door looked as though it had been kicked in at one point-it was all cracked. I dropped a piece of garbage on the floor while walking out the door quick and didn't pick it up. When we came back at night it was still in the same spot on the floor.
We tried to catch the shuttle to the strip one night and waited ten minutes because they said the guy was bringing towels to someone's room and then after ten minutes we saw him come down to the desk to get the towels. We asked the front desk to just call us a cab but they said the line was busy. My husband went outside and hailed a cab down much faster. We tried to use their kiosk to print off information about the hoover dam but that wouldn't work. We saw someone trying to print off their boarding passes while at the hotel but their printer wouldn't work.
When we checked out we weren't able to get a receipt until later because their printer wasn't working again. We were able to leave our bags there for the day because our flight wasn't until 9pm. I was iffy about leaving the bags there but they were fine and we did receive our receipt once we got our bags at the end of the day. We were able to get the shuttle to the airport which was nice.
Overall I wish I could give them a zero. I figure they will be closed down within the next three years.</p><br>DON'T STAY HERE!<p>I stayed here because of the amenities this hotel offers. They were not worth the trouble. Front desk was dishonest and said they had a "handful" of renovated rooms and first come first served to them. They only had one room that was renovated by hotel impossible show who was there to try and save this place. I stayed there 8 nights and asked if I could be transferred to the nicer room but it was unavailable any night I was there. The rooms were broke down and dirty. The toilet seat was peeling and was brown in spots from BM stain where it was peeling. There was pubic hair on the bathroom floor. Ceiling just hanging on ready to fall from water damage. Carpet stained. I found some guys pants under my bed. After 17 times of our key not working upon our return we asked to be moved to another room. Another hassle. Staff constantly bad mouth each other and try and place blame while the manager hides. I called him on my second day there and asked him to call me....he never did. Every guest we encountered was upset about dirt, charges, no answers, etc. Owner lives in China and doesn't even speak English. The GM has no experience. Sad. The building is a great location, front lobby is cute but no one cares about improving this place. Nice fountains and pond on each side of staircase but no water in it. Nice bar but it is closed down, useless wasted space. Shame on this place for not listening to Anthony when he tried to help.
Room Tip: building 1 seems better then building 3. We had little to no furniture in building 3 and when your k...

From the beginning the front desk people not welcoming and inefficient. I had to change the key twice because they did not now which rooms have two queen beds. That is a little sloppy but acceptable. When we went to the room it feels like the room was closed for years--the beds were covered with dirty looking dark green comforters. The tv is as old as 15 years. THE MOST IMPORTANT of all is the bed sheet were with lots of stains and very disgusting even to see it let alone sleep on it. I have taken a picture of it for the record. I paid 150 dollars for a day which is astronomically expensive for the service we received.

I called to the front deal if they can offer me a clean sheet. They said we will send you a clean one. However after half an hour I had to go in person to convey my grievances. They told me the maids all went home . So, what they offers me after that was a TABLE CLOSE!! Although I complained they I don't have more choice they can do for me. They cannot even refund me since I booked the room through the third party. I called here and there at around 2 am but was not lucky enough to move to anew hotel. I ended up sleeping in a table close!</p><br></body></html>
