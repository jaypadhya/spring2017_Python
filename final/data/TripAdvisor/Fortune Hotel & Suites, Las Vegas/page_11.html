<html><head><h3>Fortune Hotel & Suites, Las Vegas Reviews Page 11</h3></head><body><br>Simple place, very comfortable, no frills<p>I stayed two nights recently. I had a decent, clean room. I was in the main building on the 2nd floor. Great a/c, comfy bed, good linens. Room had a small fridge which was very cold. My biggest complaint was the bath towel. An issue with many hotels today. Never a large enough or soft enough towel to dry off with, For the price it was great, accessible to alot of stores and close enough to the strip. Staff was professional and helpful. Common areas were cleaner than expected. If you don't like to gamble alot, this is the place. Casinos on either side of the property to visit, but no loud clanging in the lobby here!!!! I will stay here again.
Room Tip: Ask for a renovated room.

It was clean, comfortable, and a decent place to stay for a night or two if your on a budget. The best part for me was the pool & extra large spa. Open 24 hours so that was awesome! The breakfast was free so that was nice, however it wasn't that good. No meat was there. The ac in the room was on and super ice cold. They had old style tvs. No extra perks here at all. No great view and not near anything. They did have a free shuttle to the airport which was very nice. The staff was very accommodating to me. I would recommend this place for someone that wants a clean place to sleep and on a budget.
Room Tip: Ask for a room overlooking the pool.

Cant find such hotel in this price in Vegas<p>One of my friend booked this hotel for me for my short 2 nights stay in the Hotel as I am not from the US and didn't plan a trip to Vegas. I found the check-in quick and easy. The central AC settings was bit new for me, but did figure out well. The bedding's was really good quality and the TV did have good number of channels. The shuttle service to the strip was helpful in the morning though i had to wait for 10-15 minis to get one. The complimentary continental breakfast was not to my likings as I am not used to such breakfast. Wished they had more international options. I never used their POOL or Jacuzzi but it looked to be reasonably fine to me. The frontdesk helped me out on how to reach out to places of my interest. The free wifi quality was very good, as I had long hours on Skype Video calls this was the best part.</p><br>HOTEL FROM HELL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<p>If you stay at this hotel, you will be sorry! This was the worst hotel experience that I've ever had in my LIFE! The hotel itself is a dump and needs to be shut down!! I am surprised that the city of Las Vegas has not done so. Rude staff must be their strong feature and the quality of rooms are worst than for animals in the zoo! The appliances here are from 1950 and the airconditioning does not let you regulate it. AWFUL EXPEIRENCE!!! I cannot say enough about this place. I did not get towel service for several days! They had an attitude with ME because I needed towels!!! Safety is definitely a factor on the premises so you need to be prepared and watchful. There was a crime that happened while we were staying here and all they can think about was that, rather than still trying to attend to the needs of the current guests!!!!!! Obviously there is not a need for the ON SITE security if crimes are a factor that they are not able to deter!! All I have to say is that if you stay here, you do so at your own risk....literally!!! And these idiots will not apologize for nothing, so there is no need to complain.</p><br>Hotel From Hell!!!!!!!!!!<p>You can't rely on the security because they don't do checks, they just sit in the lobby, they can't make beds or clean correctly. The furniture is old and can possibly fall off the wall and hurt a small child or pet. THERE IS MOLD present in the walls and ceilings which you can smell. They even have buckets to catch the water dripping out of the vents in the hallway. Save your money I'd rather sleep on the strip next trip.</p><br>Worst hotel experience ever..<p>I don't normally write bad reviews but I just have to! My stay here was horrible me and my family had to wait four hours to check in because there was a crime that had just happened any hour prior to our stay. We didn't get any sleep because we went to bed at 5 and had to be up 8 for an event. To top it off they didn't even give us a discount just a room upgrade that didn't make things right. I know that something's are out of the staff control but they could of thought of something to get guest into thier room unacceptable.</p><br>Ok Hotel<p>People that come to the place should not expect to get Wynn. Its nice and pretty cheap hotel, 5 min walking from the strip.

The front desk people helped me a lot, and my room was big and clean.

It's a good option for staying in Vegas and not spending a lot of money</p><br>Its wonderful...<p>We stayed here for the weekend recently and I must say I was nervous at all the negative reviews. I wanted to give this place a chance. Check in was a breeze quick and efficient thats a good sign as other reviews said staff wasn't so nice. I think people expect to much or weren't so friendly towards the staff. Some travelers can be rude. Anyway off to the room. Absolutely beautiful. Clean and updated nothing to complain about. Great selections of tv channels which is usually not the case in hotels. I will stay here again. I enjoyed my stay here. The shuttle services are so efficient as well fast friendly service. So if you love good service a clean rooms this place is worth considering. Irecommend it highly.</p><br>Please don't...!!!!!!!!!!!<p>This is an Hotel Imposible winner...the worst experience in a hotel ever...
Pictures of the hotel shows a lobby with a big double stairs and you may think that is not bad...but this is a real nightmare. Dirty, old and the worst thing was the girl on the front desk...rude and freaky look. I can't recall her name, I know starts with A. A of awful...</p><br>Really nice place<p>Spacious, clean, safe and comfortable facilities ... Staff helpful and friendly, WiFi included, pool and free shuttle to the Strip and the airport.
The location is pretty good, but is not located in the center of action and you will need a cab (really cheap) to go back at night after spent all day walking the Strip.
The price is pretty good and the rest quality is appreciated to recharge batteries.
Highly recommended for every kind of traveler (even with childrens).</p><br></body></html>
