<html><head><h3>Fortune Hotel & Suites, Las Vegas Reviews Page 4</h3></head><body><br>DISAPPOINTING<p>We stayed in this hotel numerous times in the recent years when it was under other banners, Ramada, Emerald springs..etc
Fortune, the new owner is supposedly transforming the hotel into a casino. In the meantime, everything is down: maintenance, pool and general cleanliness, poor breakfast ( no cereals, no milk, no eggs and when i inquired if they had milk and told the management breakfast was poor.... I was told I shouldn't complain because it was free.....).
That's really not the way to make a ...fortune.
Hotel to be avoided even though it is well located !!</p><br>Very good place<p>I stayed here over the weekend. The room was quite clean and comfortable. It has a free breakfast free shuttle and great customer service. I stayed here for the rates but will come back because they make me feel welcomed. I recommend this place if you are wanting a place to rest your head that's peaceful come here.</p><br>Worst experience ever<p>Worst experience ever! Room was ugly and dark. Service was very poor. The website says they have shuttle from and to the airport but it didn't work at all... Breakfast was disgusting and when I called the manager to say I wasn't happy, he just walked away and let me talking to the wind. He even said the shuttle wasn't working because their van had been stolen in their parking lot (hello? I am supposed to feel safe there?)</p><br>Disgusting room<p>We booked a pet - friendly room and it was just disgusting. The room smelled of urine, there were feces stains on the carpet and old dog food containers under the bed. Don't stay here! Hotels.com should remove this one from their list!</p><br>BED BUGS<p>We were there on 7/4/15 and when we arrived we were told that if we paid with debit card there is a $100 charge and that we had to wait til 3 pm to register in. We registered at 3 pm and just took our belongings up to the room and left to the strip to sight see. We got back to the hotel at 2 am and we went straight to sleep we were very tired. At 3 am we were awaken by BEDBUG BITES. We called the front desk and security came up to the room and saw that we weren't kidding. We had already caught 3 on some napkins and when he left I caught 1 that came from the headboard. It was very fat and left a big blood stain on the headboard. They offered us another room and when we went to see 1 it too had bed bug droppings. The 2nd one had a spider on the bed. That's when we said NO WE ARE LEAVING. We went to the desk to get our deposit and were told that the manager had to approve it and that he would be in at 9 am. (per other reviews it looks like no one has spoken or seen the manager). We left at 4:30 am. Now where were we going to find another hotel at 4:30 on the 4th of July. We waited at a casino and then went back to the hotel and low and behold there was no supervisor their. We left Las Vegas. This trip was our summer vacation. These are other things that are bad, the a/c made a loud noise, we were 3 and we got 2 bath towels, 1 hand towel and 1 wash cloth and they were like sand paper. Front desk personnel were RUDE, RACISTS AND UNCOURTEOUS, tv was from 1970, no cable, carpet very dirty, bathtub was dirty, the door to enter the rooms that should only open with the room key, did not lock thence anyone could come in. SO TRIPADVISOR SEARCHERS DON'T BE FOOLED the bedbugs are in the crease of the headboards. I'm so glad we got photos of all these things.</p><br>FORTH OF JULY FROM HELL<p>We stayed in this hotel thinking it would be all it had advertised in there web site, but to my surprise i was wrong, i was going up to meet my family who had traveled from new york to meet my grandkids for the first time, so everyone was excited, when i got there the first thing i was told was the room had no sofa bed and they where full, when i made the reservation the room i booked was a king suite with sofa bed, they offered a roll away bed and changed my room to the owner suite that was worse with lights going on and off in bathroom dirty sheets and towels and again no roll away. I went to the front desk to ask about the bed housekeeping said they would have it when i get back. I got back to the room about 6pm and still no extra bed when i went to front desk again, the poor pm girl had no idea what was going on she told me the kids could sleep on the floor are you kidding me my grandkids on the floor (ages 4 and 5) after waiting a while for someone to call and i guess give an ok to find a rollaway that was dirty and broken i got one. they offered no type of compensation for all this crazyness. but never again will i go there it was the worse.</p><br>Horrible Stay<p>I stayed in the hotel on March 8th to 10th booked two rooms, housekeeping never came in to clean our rooms. I told the front desk lady and she told us she was going to send somebody to clean, they never did, at check out I talked to the Housekeeping manager and he said he will get back to me to see what he could do to compensate for the inconvenience, he never called. I also left a message to the manager. up to this day, I am still waiting for al call back from either one of them</p><br>Excellent location.<p>Forget the bad reviews : this was great.
Free shuttle, excellent.
Pool, Excellent.
Quiet and no stinky Casino smoke.
Ticks all the boxes.

Yes it is a little off the stripe = cheaper.

A real good value place to stay, relax and recharge.
Room Tip: Ask for a suite.

I called the hotel and was instructed to cross to the center island outside of door 53 and he would send the shuttle. It was 101 degrees, and since the hotel is less than four miles away, I expected to see a shuttle within a few minutes. After 17 minutes, I called to check on the status. I was told that the shuttle had picked up six other people but was on its way back now. Ten minutes later, I called again, explaining that the heat was making me sick and I was stepping into the airport. I was told that the shuttle was outside looking for me at that moment so I went back out. Ten minutes later the shuttle had still not arrived and I called back and was told that it had just left. I confronted him and said that he had told me that he was here ten minutes ago. He made another excuse and I told him this was unacceptable and the heat was making me sick and I couldn't continue to stand outside. He hung up on me. I took a taxi. When I arrived at the hotel he told me that the shuttle was stuck in traffic caused by any accident. I told him that I had seen no accidents on the way to the airport and said I should have been notified so I could wait inside. When I entered my room on the third floor the AC was not on and the room was too hot to sit in. I had to sit outside in the hallway for 30 minutes before the room was bearable.It took 2 hours for the room to be comfortable.</p><br>Fortune hotel <p>I called on Saturday night on 06-27-2015 around 9:30+pm to reserved 1 night on July 04-2015 . We talked to 1 of the operator there ( forgot to ask the name ) She gave me the confirm number is 4705 . Today I called again to make sure that i have room at that time . Totally surprise me , the operator told me that I never got one , what's wrong???</p><br></body></html>
