<html><head><h3>Arizona Charlie's Decatur Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 10</h3></head><body><br>Perfectly Adequate with Bang for the Buck<p>Other reviewers seem to expect the Bellagio for a Motel-6 cost, one even citing that NASCAR weekend cost $130/nt or more at this property; surprise!--the Super 8 was charging $160 that weekend. But I digress! Charlie's IS a $30-80 hotel and my expectations were met. I was allowed an early check-in (10am) and the room was fine. Upon that early check-in, I was advised that carpet was being installed on the 3rd floor, below my intended 4th floor digs, and they told me betw which hours the installers would be working and pounding away. I declined, opting out of the tower for the other building with the staff gracious and accommodating. The bathroom didn't have an overflowing basket of toiletries (it was minimalist) but I never forget to bring my own. There was an iron/board in-room, and although the TV was smallish, there were more than 6 clear channels albeit no HBO or Showtime--again, acceptable for my 30 clams. Yes, it's away from The Strip and Downtown, part of it's charm. And casino complainers should wonder why locals *flock* to gamble here: the machines pay. I didn't dine upscale in the Yukon Grille but the food in the Sourdough Cafe is as wonderful as it is abundant, with terrific gamblers' specials, e.g. $2.99 for an 8-oz burger and fries, additional soup/side salad for 99-cents. Steak 'n eggs is also bang-up priced and verrry popular. I don't do buffets but would probably go upsclae to one of the more bally-hooed buffets on the Strip if I did...Not cuz Charlie's may or may not be good, but that I want 1st-rate if I'm gonna walk to a steamtable line to get fed. Don't play keno if you wanna just sit and drink, though: there's a goofy policy that one has to have a $10 keno ticket in-hand to get a coupon from the keno writer before they'll serve you a drink. Then, the drink I got from the bar nearest the keno lounge had a bartender whose notoriety is for pouring "light." In reality, he had *omitted* the Irish whisky from my Irish coffee. I complained. Both complaints, voiced politely, were welcomed and resolution was IMMEDIATE. I complained of the irony that PENNY SLOTS were 10-feet from my keno chair, that $1 in those mahchines would get me a cocktail if I merely sat THERE watching the keno board. If you want the glitz of The Strip, pay for it and go there. Rather paying $300/nt at the Mandalay, I'd rather pay $30 at Charlies and put the other $270 in my gaming budget! Submitting a trashy review for this LV hotel or any other because of one's bad gaming luck or skill is absurd; don't gamble, lose and besmirch the innkeeper. It's local flavor, fair gaming, and a square deal for what one pays for being away from it all. Bad thinking on the keno drink policy is the only reason Charlie's didn't get my fifth little circle, which I'll address in a letter to their G.M., as, I love keno without fumbling for a coupon when I want coffee or a CocaCola (I'm not a big drinker). Arizona Charlie's, aka "Chuck's" to some of the locals, is a good deal and great fun: local flavor with low stakes if you seek them, good food, rooms priced at value, and a terrific staff.</p><br>Sorry, you're stuck here<p>My husband and I were part of a group attending a trade show in Vegas. We made and paid for reservations through a local travel agent and MLT Vacations for airfare and rooms at the Flamingo at the end of November, 2004. Three days before we were to leave on our trip, we were notified that we were being bumped to a place called Arizona Charlies. We were told what a wonderful deal we were getting--the Flamingo was comping our rooms, vouchers for buffets, taxi vouchers, and four free nights at the Flamingo. They neglected to mention that Arizona Charlies was a dump; it is nearly impossible to get a taxi from Arizona Charlies; and our "free" nights had to be used within the next year. Needless to say, we won"t be using them!</p><br>Stay away....<p>I stayed at this place in March 2005, only because it was the only place with a vacancy during busy nascar weekend! Let me start off by saying that the their website pictures looked a lot better than the place actually did in reality. When you walk in, you're greeted with a gust of smoke and must. Check in was a breeze. The room itself was not what we thought it would be....the ceiling had a large brownish wate stain, the tv only got like 4 channels and were not even CLEAR, they were full of static. The remote didn't work, the carpet looked like it had been trampled over a million times. The shower didn't look that clean, and ALL weekend long I could hear the toilet flush....whenever anyone else in the rooms above us, beside us, etc...would flush their toilet, our toilet would flush! It was truly ghetto! I didn't feel like I was in a clean place, but we had no choice but to stay there since there was no other vacancies! I expected this place to be decent for the rate we got, but it was TOTALLY OVER PRICED!! They charged us $120 per night....how dare them, it's worth more like $30 a night! I nrver felt clean...I had to constantly use purell, because everything I touched in the room felt filthy! Gross!

Their slot machines were the crappiest machines ever! Never paid...the only good thing is that the tables had low limits. Beware of locals....we came across a couple of characters that were quite strange but provided us with some comic relief...we weren't laughing with him, we were laughing at him! HAHA

FINAL NOTE: STAY AWAY...I would never stay at this place ever again! It's totally not worth it!</p><br>OK- but won't stay here again<p>Stayed here for one night. The buffet was excellent. The gambling was good. They had tons of video poker for me, and a michine my wife loves. The traffic on decatur was brutally slow, making a trip over to circus circus take about 40 minutes to go 5 miles. The main problem was, we were woken up by walking in the room above us. I think it was the maid because there was lots of walking. I have never heard that in any room I have ever stayed in. Might go back to play or eat, but there is no way I could stay there again.</p><br>Delicious Food, Cute Room Decor<p>This hotel has delicious down-home cooking in its main restaurant, with terrific prices and extra-large servings, as well. I'll be returning for sure, if for no other reason than to sample other dishes that I didn't have time to try. I also very much enjoyed the cute, southwestern-themed room decor. Another plus was the ease of entering and exiting. The valet parking was next to the front door, which was next to the check-in desk, which wasn't far from the elevators. After making long treks in other hotels, this seemed quite efficient. Personally, I had no problem with the elevators or the hot water. I did hear noise from other rooms, but no more so than at other hotels. As another reviewer noted, the casino area is quite smoky, plus seems crowded. However, this hotel is located away from the traffic jams of the strip, has good freeway access, and is located near a major mall.</p><br>disgusting<p>Ended up here because we couldn't find another place to stay. What a mistake. I would have rather camped in the back of my truck. The carpet looked like it came out of a fraternity house beer room, the place smelled, the walls are paper thin, and I can't think of decor that could be less charming. Further, the staff couldn't have cared less about anything. How depressing.</p><br>Once a year<p>My husband and I travel once a year to Las Vegas and decided to try staying off the Strip. We had a great room/suite close to the pool. We enjoy relaxing by a pool after a long night of gambling. However, the condition of the pool was pretty bad. It hadn't been cleaned in a while. I wouldn't go swimming, but my husband did, and he even said he wished he hadn't. His swimsuit crunched after it dried. But, aside from that, the food was good and the staff was nice. The video poker machines were not kind, at least, not to us. Glad we had a rental car :)</p><br>Excellent!<p>The very first place I stayed on my first trip to Vegas. The standard room is huge with southwestern style decor. The slots paid very well...won $400 on two separate penny machines within 2 hours. Friendly, local clientele and good staff. Will definitely be back.</p><br>A terribly run place<p>We recently stayed here for 4 nights (Feb '04). We would have left after the first night, but our reservation was prepaid and nonrefundable (big mistake). The room smelled of too much air freshener, like they were trying to cover something up. We had asked for a non-smoking room, but ours was not labeled as such (while many other rooms were). When we inquired about it and the smell, they said our room was also non-smoking (right...), and that nothing else was available. The heater-A/C unit under the window rattled, and you could see that a previous guest had tried to stop the noise by jamming some paper into the metal grating. We had to put some heavy items on top of the unit to lessen the noise. That evening the shower ran lukewarm and cold. When that happened again the next morning, we immediately called to complain. The maintenance man checked it out (after we had it running for 20 min), and said it seemed fine, and that we just needed to run it for a couple of minutes first. The next morning we ran it full blast for 15 minutes before it was hot, which is absurd anywhere, let alone in the middle of a water-scarce desert. The soda machine on our floor was completely out of stock. The phone in our room was missing the plate with dialing information and instructions, so we had to keep dialing 0 to reach anyone, and the operator was annoyed. There was no coffee maker in the room, and no coffee was available without going to a restaurant or to the in-house Subway counter, where there were grounds in every pot. One afternoon, both elevators to our floor were out of order, and we were told we could not use the stairs as they were for emergencies only. So they expected us to just wait (we found the stairs on our own). The pool was closed for the season, and the jacuzzi was only open on weekends! To top it off, our credit card company alerted us after we got home that the hotel was trying to put through an unauthorized charge of $50. We settled up on check-out, so we have no idea what that was about. In there defense, I will say that with a few exceptions the staff was very nice. They also gave us a different room after two nights, and it was much better. But this place is in a bad location, has a cheesy smoke-filled casino, and offers nothing besides a good breakfast buffet, for which you don't have to endure an overnite stay.</p><br></body></html>
