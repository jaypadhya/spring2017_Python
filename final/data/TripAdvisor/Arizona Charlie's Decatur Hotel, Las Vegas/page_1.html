We stayed on strip and took cab to Arizona Charlie's. Our adult son and wife picked up our mother in law and at her recommendation as she plays bingo there her complex has shuttle that takes seniors . The Thanksgiving Buffett was great! $15:00 without Ace Players card but 10 % off






Great food clean place courteous staff . with plus seniors</p><br>went expecting bad and it was great<p>Yes it is old but clean and comfortable. Nice Casino and Bingo hall. Great food in the caf√©. Wonderful service and all the help you could ask for. A big thanks to Bobby in Valet Svc. We had a spectacular stay!!</p><br>Disappointed<p>Upon checking in, we asked to switch "towers" so my mom was closer to the bingo hall. They accommodated without a problem. We got to the room and it was very hot. Because they witched us at last minute, I thought they had just turned on the AC. The temp was at 60 and the fan was going. Checked on how to connect to WIFI, they wanted $12 a day! I hate all the little extras they charge for, especially when I paid a "normal" room rate, this wasn't some huge discount! When asked if they had any public areas with FREE WIFI, we were told we could walk across the street to the McDonalds. We went out and when we returned hours later, still very hot. My mom called the front desk and they sent someone up. She also asked about the poll and was told the hours were from 8 to 8. They waskhed the filters (shouldn't that be routine?) and adjusted the temp as they said we should not have it turned down lower than 65. Hello, it was YOUR staff that put it where it was. The next day I worked out (by the way, no fitness room) and went for a 7 mile walk, ready to come back and take a shower. No hot water. I called the desk and they said they'd send someone up. Did not hear anything for 15 minutes so I called and they said someone was working on it. Another 15 minutes and nothing. After another 15 minutes I called and they said they were "working on it" When I asked if there were showers in the pool area, he said, "yes, but I don't think they have hot water". What? He put me on hold for about 7-8 minutes and comes back on to tell me "the pool is closed for the season", after the girl the night before was giving the hours? After an hour, I finally got "piss" warm water. I was just happy to get clean. The next day we were out and about and I came back ready to work out, I checked the water before working out. No hot water. Are you kidding? But at least I had time to get them up there before I needed it. The desk clerk told me they would get back in touch with me, they did not, like the day before, I just kept checking the water. Took about 45 minutes and again, "piss" warm water. This was in the afternoon, so there shouldn't have been any shortage of hot water! Next morning, before checking out at about 7, I actually got a HOT shower! I am not happy about the lack of communication in this hotel, nor the disregard with which they seemed to deal with me and my needs. The rooms are not fancy, but they are clean and comfortable. I picked this Hotel because my mother used to live here and she would go to this casino to play bingo and gamble and she liked it. This was for her birthday. They are the only casino to have 24 hour bingo in Vegas.</p><br>Vey smokey but excellent service<p>From your entrance in the open area gambling/reception hall you will see, smell and taste tobacco smoke nearly everywhere. This is sad it's the first impression because every member of the staff there went out of their way to give an excellent service on all regards. The restaurant at the back has no wall or partition with the gambling floor so even if you sit at the back, your meal (and what I had was tasty with large portions at a very good price) will soak in the smoke and end up being displeasing to say the least (this is of course if you have a big problem with smoking like I do, if not the this place is great for you). Once you leave the main room, both the hallway leading to it and the room I had were non-smoking and were fine. The pool was clean and inviting with a low background music making it a nice spot to relax and it also had a jacuzzi next to it, many long chairs and 3 tables with chairs made this an excellent place to spend a few hours. It's location is most definitely for those having business in that part of town or that don't mind commuting by car or bus (RTC has an excellent public network at fair prices). Not much nearby. Big negative for me was the pay to use WiFi at $12 a day, really!!!! Overall you get what you pay for and I definitely got a lot for the rate I was charged.
Room Tip: Rooms at poolside made it very practical to get a dip without noticeable increase in noise.

Exterminator bill obviously unpaid for sometime. <p>We were in our first room and the toilet was flooding upon our return. Carpet sopping wet. Told to use the trash can to pee in. Complained to front desk. Moved rooms. Next day a 2 inch bug crawled across me in bed. Moved rooms again to a suite. Over charged our card. Told us we were lying about all that had happened to us. By the way I have a broken back with 2 rods and 8 screws. Management put my mother to tears. Hope it was all worth it.</p><br>Horrible unpleasant stay bad customer service<p>I booked through a 3rd party and they charged me $20, and the room was going to be $69 I was ok with that I had issues with my credit card I didn't have it with me physically but I was able to book the room and when arriving there I was going to pay cash since I didn't have my credit card with me. When I get there they charge me $121, room was smelly and not the best. I called the booking company and they told me they would call the hotel and tell them they had over charged me. They were supposed to give me back the difference in cash but I don't know why they wanted to return it on my credit card, when I had not payed with my credit card it was cash. They didn't know what they were doing so they gave the $121 back and charged my card I thought they were gonna charge the $69 to my surprise the still charged me $121. Really bad customer service I would not recommend this place.</p><br>Good Facility, Poor Reception<p>Arizona Charlie's sits in a choice location, neighboring a shopping mall. Relatively big facility but poor reception. Guests guides are practically non existent. Be sure to be treated like an old tenant even on your visit. Your keys are handed to you like you're not important or needed. You could wander with your luggage for 30 mins trying to locate entrance to your wing without any assistance from anyone. You are simply on your own once your credit card has been swiped and your key handed to you. And before you use anything (including shower), be sure to ask because you may just be incurring additional bills without knowing it</p><br>Way better than expected!<p>We stayed in a king room in the Klondike tower. We were part of a group of about 50 people who were all grouped in that tower. It was VERY convenient to escalator upstairs to buffet, bingo hall and ballroom. Let me start with casino...not huge, but plenty of variety to play slot games. I don't play table games, but there were a few there...and a poker room as well. I have seen a few reviews mention smoke in the air...I could smell the smoke, but I didn't have any issue with breathing it in. The slots were fairly friendly to our group. Keeping in mind this property is not on the strip, I thought it would be a sad little place...not at all! Restaurants...we ate at the Sourdough Cafe several times and never had a bad meal...prices were great! We also went to the buffet a few times...for such a small place compared to the big strip hotels, it was one of the better buffets I have had in Vegas! Friday night was steak night...less than $15 with players card...can't beat it! Our room was clean and had mini fridge and a coffee maker. I was very happy with water pressure in the shower...better than home! We made use of the pool a few times..not a huge pool, but clean and there were built in seats around much of it...great for hanging out with friends. There is also a hot tub big enough for a few people. If you want to do all the "Vegas" stuff, you will want to have a car...this place is not near the strip or downtown. All the staff I dealt with were very friendly and accommodating.
Room Tip: If you want a mini fridge and coffee maker, ask for the Klondike tower. I don't think the other...

It's located in the outskirts of what you may cay the central point of Las Vegas, the neighborhood is decent. The hotel rooms are pretty spacious, they are kept to a somewhat modern standard. It probably will never be on anyone's list to stay in Las Vegas, but it is great as a back up plan. The lobby has a lot of games, but it feels as if the air is stuck in there, staff is nice and friendly. Would recommend, would stay of certain occasions.
Room Tip: Ask for non-smoking rooms to have a good night
See more room tips</p><br>Smoke filled dump<p>Booked for CLC company discount. Casino floor has no ventilation and is filled with thick nauseating haze of cigarette smoke. Specifically requested non-smoking room at reservation. Room they gave me looked absolutely nothing like what they advertise on line. It was dated, dirty, and run down. The curtain was torn hanging off the rod. The bed spread looked 10 years old and was covered with large cigarette burns. Scary. I cancelled our reservation and left since they could not offer any solution.</p><br></body></html>
