<html><head><h3>Arizona Charlie's Decatur Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 5</h3></head><body><br>Started off good but went downhill quick.....<p>As a local couple in Las Vegas we like to try different upscale restaurants throughout the city. My husband is a serious "foodie", a great cook and I am one of the pickiest eaters anyone would ever meet. We tried the steak house at Arizona Charlies on Decatur last night and have to say I was very disappointed. It started off good but went down hill fast. First we were seated in the back, by the kitchen even though the entire restaurant was empty except maybe five tables. We overlooked that. We were attended to quickly by a very nice and informative waiter who gave very good advice on what to order and drink. The Chef salad he prepared in front of us was amazing and for me to say that since I generally don't eat Chef salad is definetely saying something. He recommended an amazing red wine and great steak for my husband and the sword fish for me as well as a drink. The food was good but the sauce over the swordfish reminded me of the sauce in chicken pot pies so I scraped it off. At this point we had decided he was going to be tipped VERY well but then.....we looked at our completed plates for 20 minutes with not one bus boy to clear the table and no attention by the waiter even though he walked by us at least ten times and kissed the butts of the patrons seated in the next booth. By the context of their conversation they ate there weekly and were well known. They consumed all of his attention which I am assuming because they are weekly clients and great tippers. What he doesn't know is that when we find a local restaurant we are also great tippers and will visit often and refer people. We eventually asked the bus boy for our check and at that point he took some of the plates from our table. So what could have been one of our new local steak houses will not be visited by us again which is too bad because the food was good.

Tina Highberger</p><br>Perfectly adequate!<p>We knew we wouldn't be spending much time at our hotel this trip. We just needed a clean, safe, comfortable place to sleep. This fit the bill. The decor is 80's southwest and everything in the room is rather shabby. It certainly isn't spotless, but still, it has met our needs.</p><br>Excellent value for a basic clean place to stay.<p>We had a very pleasant stay and really have no negatives to contribute. We didn't gamble or eat there. The smell of smoke in the casino area wouldn't entice me to eat there but the room was fine. Overall good value.</p><br>Good place if you get the right room<p>We planned a 1 night stay here because it was right off the highway. It's easy to find. We reserved a non smoking room, but the room reaked of smoke! We asked for a real non smoking room, but only one available was an upgraded room. Of course I had to pay the upgrade...no negotiation there since they were full. They did move our luggage since we had a dinner date. The upgraded room was very nice, no smoke. So we recommend if you get one of the upgraded rooms. Check in and out was easy, the staff was friendly. Didn't gamble, but the casino was packed. Didn't eat there, but found a great local spot 5 minutes from the hotel...go under the highway and check out Dulce Donuts.
Room Tip: Go for the upgraded rooms...much nicer

Our room was desperately in need of an update. I know this since I stayed here in 2002. Nothing had changed except for the wear and tear. Even the TV was the same, well maybe not the exact TV but very close. The shower was a big disappointment with what seemed to be a trickle of water. And very disturbing to me was the lack of parking. An entire parking lot out front was empty, reserved for valet only. Seriously....wouldn't be a great idea to give your hotel guest a place to park!
Ok so enough negatives....I loved the constant fan on the air conditioner and the front desk people were very helpful and friendly. I will go back to Arizona Charlie but only after they finish renovating the tower.</p><br>Good value at Arizona Charlie's<p>We found Arizona Charlie's on Decatur to be perfect for our visit to Las Vegas. It's convenient to the highway and we didn't notice anything "bad" about this part of town and felt the hotel was very safe. There are 24 hour restaurants on site and the food was decent and reasonably priced. The rooms were clean and the employees were very friendly. Yes, it's a locals hang out and they hang out there in droves. It was busy day and night all week long. That seems to indicate that it might be a decent place to gamble though my luck wouldn't suggest that. I would look forward to staying at Arizona Charlie's again.</p><br>Not a place to gamble.<p>Worst place to play Blackjack. They deal one deck out of the two their holding. Other casinos in Las Vegas deal 1 1/2 to 1 ¾ out of the deck, which helps the player.

If you encounter a pit person named Debbie you will find out that she is not a nice person. While I was playing blackjack one of the dealers laughed at me when I lost a hand. The dealer thought it was funny. I took the laughter as an insult. I was saddened. I called Debbie the pit boss over to me and when I told her what happened Debbie immediately said “our dealers don’t do that”.

I still feel insulted.</p><br>Stay OFF the floor!!<p>After calling every place in town to try and find a decent last minute rate due to a death in the family and we had to come into town for the funeral, I settled on Arizona Charlie's who "graciously" offered us an $86.00 per night rate which I begged for because they originally wanted to charge me over $100 a night because I did not book in advance. Don't even bother asking for a "bereavement" rate anywhere in town because what you discover is that corporate America cares only for the all-mighty dollar. It's sad really.
Our room (4408 in the Klondike tower) was adequate but this is one of those places that you check very carefully for bedbugs, we found none, thankfully. The bed was small and definitely NOT a pillowtop, only one skimpy blanket and weird sheets that appeared to be for a king-sized bed, turned sideways. There were old cigarette burns ALL over the place from the edge of the bathtub to numerous burns on the carpet in front of the elevator. Make sure you ask for a non-smoking room because they will not offer you one or even inquire as to your preference. The desk clerks reminded me of Stepford Wives with their flat personalities and emotionless interactions. I prefer people who smile and make eye contact.
If you like the more "colorful" people of Las Vegas then this is the place to people-watch. Your young kids will probably have some interesting questions for you. It is a "local's" casino, smoky and dark. They are in desperate need of an upgrade of the ventilation system. I had to wash every piece of clothing we packed once we got home, even if it was never worn. "It's a casino" is not a good excuse for that experience. There are casino's that allow smoking but you do not become permeated with the smell. But rectifying this situation would mean that the all-mighty dollar would need to spent on improvements rather then salaries of CFOs and CEOs. For the money I would much rather stay at Red Rock Resort, especially for the casino.
After all that, there was one more thing that convinced me to share my story with as many people as I can and that was what happened to my socks after 2 days (maybe a total of 5 hours, we were away from the room most of the time) of walking around. I have provided a photo as evidence of the incredibly disgusting situation here. I firmly believe that ALL the rooms are like this, especially the smoking rooms, which is most of them. PLEASE, if you stay here, especially if you have toddlers, stay off the floor! Never walk barefoot, the way I discovered this condition was by seeing the river of black that washed off of my daughter's feet in the shower. It was shocking and when I then checked my socks, I felt ill.
Room Tip: Stay off the floor! Never go barefoot!

The employees are very friendly and the rooms are very clean and have extra ammenities at no extra cost. We had read other reviews about the area not beeing so good but we found it to be a nice neighborhood and plenty of places to eat and shop for miles on Decater Blvd. They have a huge fleemarket/swapmeet building open on Fri.-Sun. from 10-6 just down the street from the Casino. It is a great place to shop. (new items at good prices). We will be sure to stay at this Casino our next trip to Vegas.</p><br>Great Value Hotel, Amazing Food<p>This was my second visit to Las Vegas, the first time I stayed on strip and found it a bit hectic being there 24/7. I opted for this one out of the main area and wasn't disappointed. The price was great value, the room was large and comfortable and the staff friendly.

We didn't visit to use the Casinos but this hotel has a good sized one if you're into that, it also an outdoor pool which is only small but given that hardly anyone else was using it cos only daft Brits sunbathe in 100 plus degree heat, it was ample.

The buffet restaurant is great value offering you huge cuts of meats and as much as you can eat. There is also another restaurant downstairs offering burgers etc and a decent breakfast all reasonably priced.

it took us a day or two to work out the transport up to the strip. Here's how it works, the buses seem to run left to right and up and down so you'll need two buses to the strip but it's all very easy. Buy a day ticket on the bus and get on on the main road by the hotel and get off a few stops along at West Charleston Boulevard. Cross over at the lights and then get the other bus heading up to the strip. It took us about 30 minutes as the buses run every 10/20 minutes.

This was a great value hotel away from the chaos but within easy reach of it when you wanted to. Can easily see why is the seasoned Vegas Go'ers choice.
Room Tip: As ever, if you're not a night owl ask for a room on a higher floor to avoid noise from the casi...
