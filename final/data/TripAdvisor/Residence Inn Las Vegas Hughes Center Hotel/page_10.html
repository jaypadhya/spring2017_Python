<html><head><h3>Residence Inn Las Vegas Hughes Center Hotel Reviews Page 10</h3></head><body><br>A really free breakfast<p>At around 9:00 a.m. this morning I was having breakfast in the breakfast area. I saw man around sixty years of age, white, American accent, slightly heavier than average, with a pot belly, wearing a long sleeved dark blue shirt and with heavy black spectacles walking to a table with two plates stacked with food. I thought that he couldn't possibly eat that much. His clothes looked less fresh than one would expect from a hotel patron coming down for breakfast. He looked as if he’d been working in them on a night shift. He was wearing a backpack and I thought it strange to wear a backpack to breakfast. He stopped at the table in front of me and started talking to an eighteen year old male who politely nodded and smiled so as not to offend him. He later went to a table and sat down and I assume that he ate the two small food mountains. He came back ten minutes later for coffee. Again he forced a conversation with an Asian lady at the coffee machine. I couldn’t help noticing that he took more than 10 half-and-half containers for his coffee. Some five minutes later he came back for fruit and this time on the way back he forced another conversation with a 45 year-old man, athletic and heavy, with a football coach physique. This was the boy’s father and he wasn’t so accommodating and he looked down at his breakfast while the conversation was being forced on him. I thought that the father was an unlikely candidate for a chat. Some time later his phone rang. He answered his phone by folding it open. I thought it strange that someone staying here still had a 10 year old phone.
He then had a loud conversation with someone. I was more than 20 feet away and I could hear that he was telling the caller how to bet on craps. He was loud and he kept repeating himself. The people at the next table were looking upset. He then went to the fruit table and came back with 2 oranges and a banana. This time I saw what happened to the fruit,… it went into the backpack. Then he then quickly got up and walked out the back door and disappeared into the parking lot behind the hotel.
Then I realized what had happened,… he had walked in from outside and had had a truly free Residence Inn breakfast (with a fruit lunch). The moral of the story is that I had twice left my smart phone and room key unattended while I went back for eggs and while I walked away for coffee. I remember thinking that everyone there was wealthy enough to afford a leisure night in a hotel and that no one there really needed to steal my phone. I also thought that it was breakfast, everyone was in a good mood, and no one would do something to upset someone else. I was right for 99 out of 100 people having breakfast here. If someone walks in to scavenge breakfast then a smart phone would be like a small jackpot. Always be careful with your phone, wallet, luggage, and other valuables. The free breakfast man drew attention to himself in several different ways and at different times. Someone that was smarter would know how to dress, how much to dish without being noticed, and how to blend in perfectly with the breakfast crowd.
Room Tip: Ask for a room with a view of the strip.

The front desk manager Andrew was always very helpful and made our stay even better! And the breakfast was like eating at a restaurant ! Close to the strip and shopping. The grocery shopping service is a plus! Would definitely stay here again!
Room Tip: Ask for a high room to enjoy the lights from the strip.

So when he check us in he put us all the way on the back side and on the second floor I came back and ask if If there's a much more higher room because I asked for a higher room and he said it the only one available with the type of room I booked. So I said ok and thank you I was polite and really understanding. Then I went back and ask if I could have some toothpaste again I was polite and really nice then he said "I only have this packets" and gave me one..... not even try to ask me if how many I need or do I need a toothbrush or whatever. I felt I was discriminated and didn't really have a good costumer service. The only good thing about this hotel are the housekeepers who are really nice and really doing their job right. That nighy auditor name is Wayne. Smile more and try to act nice.</p><br>Excellent Off Strip Hotel for Business<p>This was an excellent hotel for all of my business needs. It is away from the hustle and bustle of the strip, but close enough to get there if desired. It is in the heart of Restaurant Row, so many dining options available. Breakfast had a large variety.</p><br>Visit Again<p>Went back to this hotel during our memorial weekend visit. It is good since it is not very far from the Flamingo, walking distance and it does not have a casino, so it is peaceful. There is a small pool, outdoor barbeque facility, a jacuzzi, all useful for a family stay. This time we took a suite with 2 king beds so there was ample space with 2 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms. The breakfast is not all that great but OK. The only downsider is that there is no facilty of drinking water, so you have to buy your own. They should at least provide a water cooler on each floor so that we can fill our bottles. Orherwise good and comfortable stay with family.</p><br>GREAT LOCATION - OFF THE STRIP<p>This Residence Inn is very popular but has a great setting away from the hustle bustle of the Strip with a choice of great restaurants within the Center complex. Rooms are spacious but the breakfast area can become crowded at weekends.
Room Tip: All the rooms are about the same but the top floor is quietest.

The ironing board pad is practically non-existent but you get a full size coffee maker instead if those single-cup gadgets that other hotels have. There's a pool, two gas grills for cooking your own, and a decent fresh breakfast every morning. Parking is plentiful and convenient in the garage behind the hotel. At least five different types of cuisines are a short walk away at nearby restaurants; some just across the side street within Hughes Center. The Miracle Mile is a five minute drive and I-15 is just about ten minutes straight down Flamingo drive. It's in the Hughes Center so it's away from all the noise of the Strip. I've stayed here before and liked it - I'll definite be back.</p><br>Good Stay, Great Staff.<p>I met my Cousin in Vegas for a Thurs-Sunday girls weekend. I had 2 free nights that I needed to use before they expired. I like the Residence Inn properties because of the Kitchen and space. I chose the Hughes Center location this time. The hotel is off of the strip on Paradise which isn't far if you are familiar with Vegas. I had reserved a one bedroom unit with a pull out sofa bed in the living room. They all have the pull out sofa beds. The customer service was excellent through out the trip. The staff was so friendly and helpful. The great thing about Residence Inn's are the complimentary hot buffet breakfast. This property was fairly large and they had a great breakfast variety.. Mon-Wed they have a complimentary light dinner offering. The only complaint I have is the property is in need of a renovation. The Breakfast Buffet room looked like it had been updated and remodeled but the actual rooms need it badly. Our room was okay but nothing compared to several other Residence Inn's that I have stayed at. They are ALL supposed to be getting remodeled and many of them have been. I was talking to one of the front desk attendants and he told me that they are slated to be remodeled next January. Happy to hear that. Lastly, one of the things we really enjoyed was all the restaurants that we could walk to. There is a Gordon Biersch right across the parking lot. There was a McCormick and Scmick's which is more upscale, A Bahama Breeze and several others.</p><br>Excellent Property Tasty Breakfast Buffet<p>During my 1st trip to Las Vegas we stayed at Residence Inn for one night as I had earned the same during one of the Marriott rewards promotions.
We arrived early at the hotel and room was not ready so no early check-in was available. We had to wait for 2 hours which is why I have rated the hotel 4 stars. The hotel is located about 15-20 minutes walk from the strip and primarily serves business travelers who are in Vegas for conference.
Room was clean and bathroom has basic amenities. Hotel did provide shaving cream complementary when I asked for the same. Hotel has a small pool which had lot of leaves and small Jacuzzi was always busy. Room was quiet and we slept well.
Best part of the stay was complementary breakfast buffet which is available only from 7:00 am till 9:30 am. This suits the business traveler not the vacation people. Overall the buffet was awesome and you were spoiled for choices.
Hotel is smoke free and if you are in Vegas with family and kids and have a car then staying at the hotel would not be bad otherwise the hotel is too far from strip and costly to deserve a 2nd stay. Hotel is ideal for business travelers.
Room Tip: Swimming pool facing room

The Staff is always kind and accomadating!</p><br></body></html>
