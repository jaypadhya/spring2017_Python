<html><head><h3>Residence Inn Las Vegas Hughes Center Hotel Reviews Page 17</h3></head><body><br>Queen bed with pull out couch and kitchen<p>This hotel was great.

It was a very clean and comfortable stay.

The kitchen was great, microwave, stove top, full size fridge and a dishwasher. The staff were friendly and directed us to the walmart. They even kept our bags for us for the whole day.

I would recommend this place to anyone looking for good quality and decent pricing off the strip.

It is about a 15 minute walk to the strip, or you can catch the Duce bus just across the parking lot. There are convenience stores also across from the parking lot and a 10 minute walk to a 7-11. They also have a little shop by the desk if you want something to drink or eat or the little amenities you forgot at home.

the outside area is very comfortable and they do have two BBQs for use too. the pool is great, small but it was not overly busy at any point of the day that you could not go and have a nice swim and a tan.

I would stay here again on my next trip to Vegas</p><br>Excellent property, first rate service<p>This Residence Inn is non smoking and has no gambling. Rooms have normal bed but also sofa and frig / microwave / dishwasher. Perfect for extended stay. Amanda at the front desk provides top notch customer service!</p><br>3 words,,,,spacious, clean, comfy!!!!<p>Did not know what to expect but hotel & staff exceeded my expectations. Hotel is close enough to the Vegas strip, and was near the corporate building where I had several meeting with clients. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone whether it is for leisure or business.</p><br>Home Away from Home<p>Spent 5 nights here to relax after a west coast business trip, and the reviews are spot on. Having a one BR suite was perfect, with everything I needed at my fingertips. After a uick trip to the local grocery store to provision, the full size refrig was great for water and beverages, and although I didnt cook, having everything right there was a pleasure. A car is necessary to get around but there is no charge for parking, the location is easy to find and provides back street access up and down the strip (saves time and gas) but a strip cruise is necessary at least once...a a crawl .
The pool was refreshing, the breakfast standard, and the staff were friendly and excellent. Dont let the off strip location keep you from staying here: close to many restaurants and there is foood delivery to your door if you want to eat in.
I know I will stay there again (and I have stayed at many hotels on the strip over the years). I would give this hotel a 2 thumbs up!
Room Tip: Higher floors facing east have a lovely sunrise view

The breakfast was generous and of good quality. I wouldn't recommend walking to the Strip during July or August when the temps go over 100 degrees, take a cab! I was disappointed with the pool being closed during my stay but I understand that safety comes first. I will stay here on my next visit to Vegas.</p><br>Great hotel: spacious and clean rooms!!!<p>Had a great experience at this hotel! The rooms were spacious and clean, the lobby very nice, the saltwater pool and hot tub very well kept and organized. The breakfast and complimentary welcome dinner were very nice! Excellent for what it costs, and only 15 minutes walking from the strip or 7-8$ taxi ride! Definitely reccomend!!</p><br>Great location<p>The only reason I am giving it a 4 rating is because the pool was closed 4th of July weekend for maintenance which I thought was a poor choice of date to do this. The breakfast is excellent with hot eggs, potatoes, meat-varies each day, yogurt, cereals, fruit, waffles, etc. Lots of hot food with many choices. The rooms are clean and neat and well maintained. Staff was friendly and there is free WI-FI, use of 2 computers and printer in the business center and a fitness room. Amble free parking and it is right on Paradise Rd. basically behind Harrah's on the strip.
Room Tip: All rooms would be quiet-off the strip in a business park type area.

Which made it extremely reasonable for 4 people. We had a Suite which comprised of 2 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms and a living/dining Kitchen room with entrance. We only stayed the one night but we received excellent attention with our many many question. The rooms were very nice and very clean we didn't need the kitchen but it looked well fitted (found and used bottle opener and scissors). The pool was a nice size and the outdoor area was nicely furnished. I was pleasantly surprise and if i had to go to Vegas again for some other reason then "Doing Vegas" i.e., family gathering, stopover, etc., i would stay there again.</p><br>Great Off-Strip Location - Very Pet Friendly<p>This hotel is a solid 4-4.5. If you don't want to stay on the strip and are looking for a "regular" hotel in a quieter area of town, but with the option of walking to the strip in 20-25 minutes, or taking a quick cab, this is the spot. It's a "regular" hotel. No casino. It's in a quiet and nice area next to a large office complex with sidewalks to walk-on. The rooms are good, and they are quiet.

Free WiFi works well. On busy days the breakfast area can be chaotic. The breakfast is good. They rotate special items. The best was the breakfast sandwich - friend egg and sausage on an english muffin.

The rooms could use better shades. The windows are large/long, and the shades in my room - 216, did not block out the morning light.

Pet-Friendly: Yes, very much so. There is a small area to walk your dog behind the hotel, BUT, you can walk down the numerous sidewalks along Hughes Parkway where there is ample grass on both sides of the sidewalk, and there is a nice park that is a 10-minute walk from the hotel. If you are bringing your dog with you, this is your best bet.

I had a Queen bed suite with a kitchenette. The price over Memorial Day weekend was good at $159 a night, but they did not lower the price mid-week when the hotel, and Vegas, emptied out.</p><br>Great Stay<p>I was sent here on business travel, so I wasn't too concerned about where I was staying since I wouldn't even be there much. However, I was so pleasantly surprised. The rooms are big with a full kitchen. The free breakfast was delicious with lots of choices. Hot choices like eggs and sausage and potatoes, not just prewrapped pastries and cereal like at other hotels. Then when I returned in the evening they had dinner and wine and beer. I had already eaten out, so I didn't try it, but I was still very impressed. The whole place was very well kept. I didn't go to the pool, but I could see it from my room and it looked nice. Even though I wasn;t paying, I still noticed the price was very reasonable, escpecially with the endless ammenities this hotel offers. If you need to stay off the strip in Vegas, I 100% recommend this hotel. On a side note, we had dinner at Bahama Breeze which is right in front of the hotel and the salmon was amazing. There are several restaurants right by the hotel, easy walking distance.</p><br></body></html>
