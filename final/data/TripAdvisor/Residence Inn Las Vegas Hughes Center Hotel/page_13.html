<html><head><h3>Residence Inn Las Vegas Hughes Center Hotel Reviews Page 13</h3></head><body><br>BAD EXPERIENCE<p>I've been a rewards member for six years and have stayed on each coast including the gulf and this was my second stay at this location in the past three years, and it hurts me to say that this was the worst stay ever under the marriott banner. First it appears as if the two br suites are being overlooked as far as upgrades and upkeep, the furniture was soiled and stained the tiles were cracked, the appliances looked outdated and dirty, for various reasons I had to move twice one being an awful smell of septic gas that scared one guest away altogether instead of moving to another room as I did. Needless to say my next stay in Las Vegas will not be at this location
Room Tip: If you need a two bedroom suite try another marriott location!

Great place to stay with children or for people that don’t want to stay at a casino. We needed a place in front of the restaurant where we were having a party so it worked great. Usually we stay downtown at the Golden Nugget and we will head back there because we like to be in a casino.
Room Tip: We were on the 7th floor away from the elevators and liked the view

We have a 14 m/o puppy and needed to find a hotel in Vegas close to the the strip that was pet friendly. I looked at Marriott hotels through their mobile site on my cell phone and saw the hotel said pet friendly, so I booked a night. When we checked in, we were greeted by a front desk associate (who I guess was the manager). He clearly should've seen my dog who was with me on leash and my boyfriend was carrying her crate. He checked us in without acknowleding a dog or a pet policy and we stayed the night.

The next morning, we received our bill under the door stating there was a $100.00 pet charge. I thought maybe it was a deposit in case of room damage. My boyfriend and I went downstairs to check out and asked the front desk woman if it was a refundable deposit. She said no. We began to tell her that there was no statement of a pet charge on the mobile website, for we would have never paid $100 to have a pet stay in a hotel for a single night. She argued that it was on the website (which it is on the regular website, but not the mobile). She was rude and defensive instead of understanding and apologetic for the confusion. She kept making up excuses and lies about Marriott's policies, which I know are false statements because I have family that work for other Marriott hotels.Terrible customer service.

We left the hotel and contacted the manager the next morning who claimed he is the one who checked us in. He didn't even state a friendly reminder about the pet charge at check-in. He claimed he didn't even see us have a dog with us, but that housekeeping informed the front desk there was a dog in the room. However, we were there for only one night, and housekeeping never came in our room during our stay. No one, not even the manager, was wanting to be accountable for the pet charge misunderstanding. We simply told him we wanted to be refunded for being kept in the dark for a $100 pet charge, but he said he was unable to accommodate us. No apologies, no refund, not even a complimentary stay from Marriott. Just rude treatment as a paying guest.

I will NEVER stay there again. For that kind of money, we could have stayed on the strip at a nice casino and been treated with respect.</p><br>Good off the strip location. Good rooms.<p>This hotel is located far enough from the strip to avoid the noise and get a decent night sleep but close enough to get a taxi.
The front desk staff were always helpful and endeavoured to help with any issues.
The rooms are adequate, a very comfortable bed with a good bathroom and kitchen area.
If I was staying in Vegas on business again I would sty here.</p><br>Good Business Fare...<p>Stayed here on business with a group of colleagues. It is in a good location to be off strip, and right next door to Gordon Biersch! Rooms are ok, nothing special, but it is nice to have a BBQ area by the pool - good for socialising!</p><br>It's ok not great.<p>I paid over 200 a night for this room. I chose this place because of its distance to the sands convention center. The cab ride was around 8 dollars. The walk was about 20 minutes but I passed some homeless poeple on the way. But the rooms wear ok but not very roomie we had a 2 bedroom suite. The clerk thought I was stealing from the lil store. She called me back to see if I took anything. I was upset but did not want to make a big deal about it. But I must say this marriot had the worst service of any marriot I've experienced I won't ever stay here again! But there is plenty of places to eat within walking distance. Plus it was a safe place to stay. And the eggs were watery. So if you don't mind the service and love location to strip. Good for a family.</p><br>Disappointing<p>Previously stayed at the Residence Inn Las Vegas South. Was going to stay there again but they were sold out so decided to try this Residence Inn.

I found this Residence Inn to be disappointing. My experience with other RI's is there is some evening snacks (bbq, soup/salad) on Mon, Tue and Wednesday evenings. I was tired and really wanted to just grab a simple dinner at the RI. But this RI did not have dinner on the Wed that I was there. They have dinner every Mon and Tue but only every other Wed.

I am an elite member and the key holder had a scratch off game. The receptionist never bothered to tell me about this. When I got to my room, I noticed the game piece and had to ask about it when I was back down in the lobby. Not very proactive of the receptionist to explain things in detail at checkin.

The quality of the breakfast was not very good. Eggs didn't have the consistency or taste of scrambled eggs. These were watered down.

The gym was freezing cold. Not a good temperature to exercise in.

No thanks. I'll try stay at the LV South location if possible.</p><br>Maybe I chose a bad time to stay?<p>I did not care for this hotel much. The room was okay but after about 10 minutes in the room, the room started to stink bad like marijuana. I thought it might go away but it just got stronger and the whole hallway was taken over by the smell. I told the staff and they gave me a room on another floor which was great. But they did not have any other rooms with a view available so we had to move to one of the bottom floors. I don't blame the hotel for this, I was just unlucky. Also it was crowded with people from the electric daisy festival. I think I just chose the wrong time to come. The rooms were dated. The pool area was so so and it was difficult to find parking. I don't think I would go back here.</p><br>Worth every penny<p>Stayed twice for one night each and can not have ANY complains. Room was quite large and clean , as well as having all amenities needed.Front desk staff was very friendly and professional.
Plenty of parking in garage , away from the heat.Managers evening snacks plentyful as well as breakfast buffet.
For a few $ more , this is the place to stay one or more nights when in Las Vegas !</p><br>Great off strip hotel for families<p>We stayed at the Residence Inn Las Vegas Hughes Center on two separate nights in August 2013. Both times in a two bedroom unit, one on the first floor, the other on the second floor. Both units were wonderful with two bedrooms (queen size bed in each bedroom) a sleep sofa in the living room, a full kitchen (which we took advantage of) and best of all with 3 televisions, one in each of the bedrooms and the living room. One of the nights we used the bar-b-que out by the pool, which was great. The hotel also offers a light dinner on weeknights,with a nice breakfast until 9am, so if you sleep in you can make your own breakfast.

We loved the idea of having a kitchen, with a real stove, microwave and oven. It saved us a ton of money. The location was perfect as well, close to the airport, close to the strip and if you have a car, everything is close by.

Interestingly enough, this hotel is more expensive than the larger, fancier hotels on the strip (at least that was the case in August, but we used points) but its worth it if you want to avoid the larger hotels, casinos and just have the convenience of easily getting to your car. There is not much in walking distance, so a car is necessary. There is a pool and outdoor sitting area which is nice. All in all, this is a great location and hotel if that's what you are looking for.</p><br></body></html>
