<html><head><h3>Residence Inn Las Vegas Hughes Center Hotel Reviews Page 22</h3></head><body><br>Overall good but...<p>Staff was superfriendly, the hotel was clean, the TVs were new and large, and the location was great (just close enough to the Strip) but a few things disappointed me:
* They didn't give me my wake-up call on the day of my departure
* They advertise you can buy in-room movies but the service is no longer available.
* Stingy on the nighttime reception -- only offered a couple of weeknights. I guess they figure you'll be heading to the Strip most days of your stay.
* There are supposed to be vending machines in certain spots, but those spots are empty. So if you want a snack, you're stuck going to the very pricey food closet by the front desk.</p><br>Good value in LV<p>Stayed at this location three times in past two months. Nice size two room suites with kitchen facilities. This Residence Inn is a good value for Vegas, especially for families with kids or extended business trips. You kind of need a car, lots of free parking. Star bucks, Kinkos, several chain restaurants within walking distance and Vegas strip a few minutes away. LAS is a 10 minute drive/ $20 cab ride.

On one occasion front desk staff seemed rushed and bothered (I think front desk even pointed out "we are not full service hotel". Overall, staff was helpful and friendly for Vegas.

The best part of this location is free breakfast as it is superior to most Marriott breakfasts buffets, well stocked and they offer some variety from day to day. If you are on a limited per diem, have lots of kids, this is a solid value.

Bath is small and vents in bath need to be cleaned, but overall clean and comfortable establishment.</p><br>Economy with comfort<p>I booked this hotel for a day and the best thing about it was the homely comfort I enjoyed.
The room service was amazingly good.
The location was perfect with lot of restaurants around. I could easily find my favorite cuisine around.
The room condition was very good with comfortable bedding and entertainment system.
One of the very good things was the kitchen that was attached to the room. I could easily cook.
One thing I didn’t like were the toilet accessories. The soap quality was not good.
Overall, I enjoyed the stay.</p><br>Nice and Quiet<p>If your looking for someplace that is off the strip and DOES NOT have gambling this is your place. The hotel is non-smoking and because there is no gambling there are no acceptions. It's quiet, clean but close enough for some to walk or just a short taxi ride to a major casino.

Also the internet speeds at this Residence Inn is far better than other locations I've stayed at in the past.</p><br>Very Good but Needs Attention to Detail<p>This was our third or fourth stay at this hotel in a two bedroom suite and it has always been a very nice hotel offering great value. However, on this trip, we did notice some signs of wear and sloppy housekeeping.

One of the two air conditioning systems did not seem to cool the bedroom & living area efficiently. Also, when the wall hair dryer was used, it always blew a fuse in the bathroom requiring the red reset button to be hit. Upon arrival, the stovetop had lots of crumbs scattered across the top and the bedroom lamp shades were very crooked. Small gripes, but we are used to a higher standard from Marriott.

The free parking and convenient access to many restaurants and the short drive to the strip still make this a very attractive hotel offering value and we would stay here again.</p><br>GREAT!<p>Arrived late at night. Short staffed but helpful. Property is in a great location for fun in Vegas while still being low key and relaxing. Room was nicely appointed and clean. Public areas were very nice, pool was clean and the patio was comfortable. This property is a new favorite for our Vegas trips. Thank you RI Hughes Center!</p><br>Nice Hotel, tucked just away from the Strip<p>Stayed here for 3 nights in a 2 bedroom suite. The rooms were clean, everything worked, wi-fi was fine, breakfast as expected, staff very helpful. Great hotel.

The hotel is about a 15 minute walk to the Strip straight down Flamingo Rd, where you arrive between Caesars and the Bellagio and are pretty much central to the main parts of the Strip. Perfect if you want to avoid the noise of the Strip hotels and casinos at night.

We arrived after visiting the Grand Canyon (4 hr drive away) and then used this hotel to visit Vegas and to also explore Death Valley (2 hr drive away). WOW. Death Valley is impressive and if you stay here (or anywhere in Vegas), it is a must see (so's the Grand Canyon by the way!).

We also visited the Hoover Dam which to me looks about empty! I could be wrong, but I visited the Hoover Dam in 2000 and again in 2001 and either there is a big leak somewhere in that wall, or the water is rapidly running out for Vegas!!

I also noticed the large number of new hotels that have sprung up since my last visit. They all look pretty impressive. The abundance of Mexicans up and down the Strip offering calling cards for girls within 20 minutes was not. They were annoying.

I would definitely recommend the hotel to anyone visiting Vegas and the surrounding area.</p><br>OK Place to Stay But See Review<p>This is the eight or ninth time we have stayed here since 2004. The hotel last had a major renovation done in the summer of 2005.

They now have 42" LG plasma TVs in the living/kitchen areas and 37" plasma TVs in the bedrooms. However, they still have the same analog cable/satellite system resulting in a sub-par picture on a 42” set.

It looks like they have done some touch-up repainting of the walls in the rooms. The carpet in our 1-bedroom unit and the hallways was in excellent shape even after almost 5 years.

1. There are no bed bugs.

2. They only have the evening reception on Monday and Tuesdays with one on alternating Wednesday as was the case last year. Breakfasts could be a little chaotic, they sometimes would almost run out of bagels and you would have to ask them to replenish these. They have the same food selections every morning. They apparently have less staff than in our previous visits there. Coffee service is only available in the mornings and those evenings when there is the reception.

3. They have replaced all the room thermostats with a new energy saving SensorStat system with a wall mounted wireless thermostat, an infrared (IR) motion detector in each room of a unit and a wireless door entry sensing switch. These thermostats automatically switch between heating and cooling depending on the room temperature. They have taken away the ability to fully control the temperature in the room, the air flow, and to choose between heating and cooling.

The two computers and printers in the Hearth Room are getting a little old and need replacing.

Overall the Residence Inn at the Hughes center still offers one of the best values and locations in Las Vegas, especially if you are going to be there for at least 5 or more nights.</p><br>Location good, Breakfast good, Rooms so so<p>Stayed there for 3 nights. My son got married at the Wynn so the location for this place was just minutes away. First the good: Staff was very nice and helpful. Location was real good. Breakfast was real good and plenty of it. Pool was nice. Parking was fine. Rooms had 2 bathrooms. Now the not so great: Rooms while decently clean but were dated and worn. Very Drab. The place really needs a renovation.</p><br>wonderful place to stay<p>The staff are very friendly, the price is great, and everything you expect in a hotel is here not too mention the breakfast</p><br></body></html>
