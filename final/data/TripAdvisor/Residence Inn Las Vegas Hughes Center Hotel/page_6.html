We know we can always count on the Marriott family of hotels. This Residence Inn was no exception. It was in a great location, close to the Strip but in a quiet area with multiple eating choices close by..
Green Features: Standard Marriott - on target with all common sense environment issues.</p><br>Sub par for a Marriott property<p>Great location and staff is very friendly. However I was extremely disappointed with an internet outage for 7 of the 11 nights I stayed, especially for a hotel that caters to business travelers. Excuses ranged from "it's all of Las Vegas", "the server is being overnighted", "other parts are bad". The options from the desk were to use FedEx or Starbucks. I realize that problems happen but to not be prepared and allow it to exceed more that a couple business days is unacceptable.

As for the room. Great view of Paradise and Flamingo but be aware that you'll hear jets from the airport and pretty routine sirens from emergency vehicles. This might be drowned out by the constantly running bathroom and HVAC fans that you can't control.

This is the second time in the last few months I've been let down by Marriott properties and probably won't give them a third time.
Room Tip: South side rooms facing Paradise and Flamingo are subject a lot of aircraft and emergency vehicle no...

As the price was quite favorable was surprised to find a very large room - complete with couch, coffee table, moderate bathroom and most importantly a kitchenette which is helpful for a long stay. View wasn't great and neither was the free breakfast (but it was free). Right beside bahama breeze which is a great restaurant (firecracker shrimp and the shrimp/lobster quesidilla are both musts) - you tell them your staying at the residence inn and they'll give you a generous discount. All in all, good stay. About 10 minutes very warm walk to the strip.</p><br>Clean, convenient accommodations with a fantastic included breakfast<p>We stayed here on a quick overnight on our way to Arizona. Check-in was terrific. The staff were all friendly. Our room had a separate sitting room and kitchen and was very clean. Marriott bedding is always good. Itâ€™s very close to, but away from, all the madness of the Las Vegas strip. Best of all is the included breakfast buffet: delicious eggs, sausage, yogurt, fruit, the works. Highly recommend this hotel for a non-smoky, non-casino hotel in the heart of all the Las Vegas action.</p><br>Good location and great room.<p>Really enjoyed the incredible staff. The room was clean and comfortable. Had my dog with me and the hptel is well suited for that. Reasonable pet fee.

Bit of a walk to the strip but completely doable. $10 taxi to the Belagio.

$6 domestic beer charge -yikes. But even worse at liquor store down the street. Go to the grocery store and save yourself a ton of money.</p><br>Pleasant Surprise<p>Enjoyed the hotel very much. Stayed two nights. love the location and no casino. Felt safe and the room was clean and quiet. Gym was good and equipment worked. Breakfast was very crowded but very good. Coffee during the day is a nice touch. Easy walk to Sands convention center and $7 cab ride.</p><br>Adequate<p>It is nice enough but nothing special. I liked the location. It was $200 for that Saturday night but we used our points. The room was clean and spacious. The staff was nice but there wasn't alot of interaction. It is right near rhe airport but sound is not that bad.</p><br>Great place close to everything<p>This Residence Inn is just a couple of blocks from the strip yet is sort-of secluded in the Hughes business park. It is quiet and a good place for families or those wanting to do some meals at the kitchen in the unit</p><br>Many issues during CES 2015 week -- avoid it until it is upgraded<p>We have had great experiences at many Residence Inns. This was not one of them. Perhaps it can be attributed to the fact that this was CES week in Las Vegas, but this was near the Strip or any CES location. So here's the list. The chairs in our room were stained, the window sills were filthy, the sink drained too slowly. The AC filter needed to be changed. The dishes that had been 'washed' by housekeeping still were sticky inside the mugs. The chairs for the table had not been dusted, the reading lamp had no on-off knob and the bulb flickered. There was no Decaf Tea. No laundry bag. The worst, though, was to pick up a 'clean' dish in the dining room and find food on both sides. In typical CES fashion, the room was more than double its normal price.
Presumably the hotel will be remodeled one day soon. Check ahead before booking.</p><br>Ok hotel<p>Room amenities are ok good..fridge, microwave etc.
Bed's not that comfortable.
Towels are too old.
Breakfast is good with varieties if you stay more than one day.
Staff are all friendly and accommodating.
You can find better hotels at the same price in Vegas.</p><br></body></html>
