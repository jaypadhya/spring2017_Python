<html><head><h3>Residence Inn Las Vegas Hughes Center Hotel Reviews Page 26</h3></head><body><br>Quiet, good location, clean and comfortable.<p>I went from staying at the Excalibur to the Residenc Inn and was impressed by the quality of the rooms. The decor in my room was bright, cheery and upto date. The bed was comfortable. The kitchen was well equiped and very convenient. The internet was included and the service was prompt when needed. This place is a great place to stay if you want a good central location in Las Vagas but want to be able to have a nice quiet retreat away from the strip.</p><br>Beautiful Room, Friendly Service, Convenient Location<p>September 25th to 27th 2005 – I had the pleasure of staying here for two nights to attend the Pack Expo show. Everything aspect of my stay was very good to excellent.

Check in was fairly fast and everything was in order. I received my requested room type, a non-smoking Studio, #415. This is a “high rise” style Residence Inn with 9 floors in one building. The room rate for my stay was $169 per night which was good considering there was a major convention in town.

I was surprised and really pleased with my room. It appeared that it had been renovated very recently. The décor was much nicer than other Residence Inn hotels that where I have stayed. It had the new style Marriott bedding with a white duvet and five pillows (3 feather and 2 foam) on the queen-size bed. The queen-size sofa bed and the chair were new, as was the carpet and draperies.

The bath area had a large marble vanity open to the bedroom area. The combo tub/shower and toilet had a door for privacy. The bath linens all appeared to be new and there were plenty of them.

My studio room had a full-sized refrigerator with an ice maker in the freezer. There was also a full-size microwave, a two-burner electric range, a toaster, coffee maker, and dish washer. I arrived late in the evening and had not had dinner. I did not want to go out so I bought a frozen dinner, a soda, and ice cream from “The Market” a “micro” market within the hotel. My studio room did not have a table, but had a bar with two high bar chairs which was very adequate.

The complimentary breakfast buffet was very good. On the hot side there were scrambled eggs, sausage, and make-it-yourself waffles. The buffet also offered coffee, juice, fruit, cereals, etc. There was also an complimentary evening buffet which I did not see or use.

For working, the desk was adequate and there was an office-style chair that was very comfortable. The hotel offers complimentary wireless high speed internet which worked great. The upload speed was about as fast as I have ever experienced.

The hotel has a good location, near the intersection of Paradise and Flamingo roads. The Residence in is surrounded by restaurants: Hamada (Japanese) Cozymels (Mexican), Gordon Biersch Brewery, McCormick and Schmicks (upscale sea food), Lowrys (upscale prime rib), and Pieros (Italian). It takes about 15 minutes to walk to the strip and about the same to walk to the Convention Center. There were always taxi cabs waiting outside the hotel.

The swimming pool at the hotel is somewhat small, but there were plenty of lounges and pool towels. There is also a whirlpool spa and a small exercise room. There is plenty of free parking all around the property, including a two level lot behind the pool.

Service was very friendly and efficient from every associate that I came in contact with. I enjoyed my stay and can recommend the Residence Inn Hughes Center. I will very likely stay here in the future.</p><br>Perfect location for fun and tranquility!<p>The Residence Inn Las Vegas Hughes Center is a great place to stay. Its only ¾ of a mile from the Las Vegas strip which is so close to all the craziness and fun, but just far enough away to be able to relax without all the chaos and noise. I liked the free internet access, breakfast, and happy hour!</p><br>The Residence Inn was great!<p>Ideal location. This hotel is positioned less than 1 mile from the famous Las Vegas strip. I loved it because it wasn’t right in the middle of all the chaos, but just close enough to walk to the casinos and various attractions. I came with my husband, mother-in-law, 25 year old daughter, and dog Lucky. This hotel was ideal because they offered smoking rooms, as my mother-in-law requested, and then even allowed pets! We couldn’t leave lucky behind! The kitchen and dining room space allowed us to save more and eat in a few times. Believe me this was definitely helpful with all the money we spent gambling! I recommend the Residence Inn to everyone!</p><br>What didn't happen in Vegas?!?!<p>I went to Vegas for my 21st birthday in March with 6 of my best friends, and boy did we have the time of our lives! The surroundings, nightlife, and various forms of entertainment made the trip incredible; but it was nice to come back to a nice, comfy hotel room with great amenties. Though we went out to eat pretty often, as college students we were on somewhat of a buget, so bringing food back to our full service kitchen to cook in was very helpful and convenient. They even had free high speed internet so I was able to hook up my laptop and check e-mail for work! One of the most exciting moments in Vegas was running into celebrities such as John Travolta, Demi Moore, and Brian Austin Greene. I will remember this trip forever!!! :-)</p><br>Wonderful Place!<p>Just returned from a trip to Las Vegas/Grand Canyon (week of April 25th). Stayed at the Residence Inn-Hughes 2 Bedroom suite for three nights. We usually stay at a Residence Inn elsewhere when we go on vacation. This Residence Inn (Hughes) is above average than the other Residence Inns. The suites were very clean including the sheets and bathtub and quiet. Unlike other Residence Inns, we had no problems with waiting for the elevators, which came quick and often. During the 3 days, we did not hear or see any people in the hallways. We had wondered at times whether there were any other people staying in the hotel until we saw how many people there were at breakfast time. Our room was on the 10th floor and we had a good view of the mountains and a part of the Strip. Unlike the mega hotels on the Strip, parking was easy and plentiful. Hotel staff/reception were very friendly and made you feel welcomed. Checking inn took less than 10 minutes for us. The full kitchen including full size stove, oven, refrigerator, microwave, coffee maker came in handy, although we did not use them much since the hotel served a full breakfast hot buffet and an evening light meal/happy hour. Breakfast had a wide variety of hot foods such as scrambled eggs, sausage patties, pancakes, make you own waffles, biscuits, fresh fruits, cereals, oatmeal, juices, milk, coffee, teas, hot cocoa, etc. .. Getting to the Strip was easy as long as you know where the self parking lots are at the "mega" hotels. Driving to the strip was quick and very easy from the hotel although one cannot predict traffic. We couldn't use the pool during our stay because the weather was too cold and a bit rainy, but it looked good. It felt like home when we came back to our rooms in the evening after a day of sight seeing. As long as you have a car, there should be no problem going out to eat, shopping or sightseeing. It's a very close drive to McCarran Airport (maybe 10 minutes away), but we didn't hear any airplanes at all during our stay. We would definitely stay here again when we return to Las Vegas. The Residence Inn made my family's vacation very comfortable.</p><br>Great Place to stay!<p>Great place to stay, small pool that was exactly 65 degrees so it was too cold to swim but the spa was nice and large. Free high speed internet access, large fridge with ice maker, dishwasher, microwave, 10 or 12 cup coffee maker not the small ones you see in most places, well worth the price. Could be difficult to locate at night, if you are not taking a taxi you may want to mapqwest the location. One nice thing is that you can get from your room to your car or truck in min or two, you don't need to pack a lunch to hike to your car 1/2 mile away like you might at one of the huge locations on the strip. Another cool perk for the guests is the large outdoor BBQ grill. You could pick up some nice steaks etc. at a supermarket and have a good meal at a fair price.</p><br>Yuck!<p>I spent one night at this Residence Inn and was disgusted by the state of the room - and especially the bedding. The sheets were badly stained, paper-thin and had cigarette burn holes! I would not recommend this to anyone at all finicky about cleanliness.</p><br>Pretty good hotel but more suited for business travelers.<p>We stayed here one night during a very busy NASCAR weekend and booked last minute when everything was full or super expensive. We booked her one night since the Tuscany could not accomodate us for an extra night at a good rate. Weekend rate of 149.00 was excellent.

It was a one bedroom suite, with full kitchen. Double bed in bedroom, 2 TV's with cable, bathroom is in the bedroom. Couch pulls out as a SMALL sleeper so it only holds 1 person. Not ideal if you have 4 people like we did, so somebody sleeps on the floor. They really should notify people that the sleeper does not fit 2 people.

The price includes a nice breakfast buffet. The breakfast buffet closes early M-F they start putting food away at 9am. Makes sense since this is a mostly business hotel. Weekends they keep the buffet open a little longer. If it is closed when you get there just go across the street to the Tuscany their breakfat buffet is open until 11am and it is only 5.99.

Location is about 15 minute walk from the strip, off of Flamingo road. Hotel is perfect for business travelers and right next to Hughes Center.</p><br>More than adequate<p>The one bedroom suite was clean and had all the amenities. The free breakfast was excellent: eggs, sausage, hot and cold cereal, fruit, etc.
It seemed a bit pricey, however.</p><br></body></html>
