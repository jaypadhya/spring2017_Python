It's nice to get away from the Strip and get some quiet time. The hotel is close enough to the Strip to walk...about one mile...and a very short drive. The hotel was clean and the service was great. The rooms have kitchens which is nice. Breakfast was nice.
I have stayed here a few times now and would recommend if you don't mind a short drive or walk to the Strip.</p><br>Great place to stay - close to everything<p>This is a great place to stay outside the strip. Several good restaurants just outside your door and within walking distance (or a quick taxi ride) to the centre of the strip. The rooms are spacious and well equipped with a small kitchen and bedroom separated from the main room. Free wifi internet and TV in both rooms. The usual American hotel amenities are there too - wash room, gym (although a rather limited one with very few dumbbells), pool but also tennis/basket court and free parking just outside the door. The A/C is a bit noisy - sensitive sleepers might find this disturbing. The breakfast is less than average with a very limited choice of bread. Continental style for the rest of it. The scrambled eggs are however excellent. Friendly staff and well sound proofed rooms makes this a comfy place to stay. The also provides a free evening buffet (very limited but free) some nights of the week. Recommended!
Room Tip: The rooms with the lowest numbers on each floor seems to be furthest away from the elevator.

The good things: the breakfast was really good, included in the price too. A great location, 10 minutes walk from the strip, 20 minutes from the convention center. Free parking. A really nice modern building but here's the best thing ... NO SLOT MACHINES, NO CASINO, SO SMOKING. Yahoo!, what a change compared to most Vegas hotels. Right next to the hotel was a brew pub and Bahama Breeze, so there were 2 great places to eat at night within a 1 minute walk. I am a Silver Elite Marriott member and for our last night we were using points, so they kindly allowed us to stay in the same room even though our points only entitled us to a smaller room. They were great. We were there in January and the pool was fully open; there was a fantastic hot tub and a reasonably warm main pool too.

Bad things: the hotel is on the edge of a sketchy part of town where I was hassled a couple of time by hobos while parking my car at the hotel. However please note it was very safe and I didn't feel threatened. Also I asked the hotel to replace the poolside towels because there were none left and they didn't bother (24 hours later there were still no towels). Also we phoned down to reception to get an extra blanket for the room and it never showed up.

Overall, when I next stay in Vegas for a conference or for business I will stay here. Way better than the casino hotels.</p><br>good place to rest<p>As we checked in we were warmly greeted by Blanca at the front desk and got us a corner room away from elevator as we had requested. It is so refreshing to walk in the lobby without smelling that nasty cigarete smell that clings to your body for several hours. Our room was cleaned on a timely manner...bed very comfortable.....Buffet was adequate...we didn't find a 24hr coffee service at the lobby like the other Residence Inn...several good restaurant within 5min walk and a Starbucks across the parking lot....the only disappointment we had was the hotel did not have a recycling container.... so we took home all the recyclable since we drove to Vegas...also we didn't find any Vegas brochure in the room...our surprise find was the swap meet on North Las Vegas Bl....apprx 15min drive from the strip...overall our stay at the Residence Inn Hughes Center was great....</p><br>Good response time<p>We checked in, and had water running in the toilet, as we headed out,someone was to go up and fix it. Several hours later, at 9:30 PM, I talked to the front desk, and they were up fixing it immediately, and it was fixed this time. Next morning I left a note, asking for several things that should have been in the room, and asked for another repair, and clean air filters and air ducts. When we returned after work, all were taken care of. Unfortunately, we were not left coffee (a morning necessity), and the front desk would not get us any regular, as it wasn't at their desk. They did tell me they would ask for more to be left in the room next day. The room could have been cleaner, drips down the front of the cupboards, dirty dishes, dirty air ducts and filters, empty packaging from previou guest, but we will be staying a month or so,so I cleaned what I could.
Hopefully housekeeping will get better. The breakfast was better than average, and the evening social too. We'll see.
Room Tip: higher floors for best views of the strip lights

We were in for the SEMA/AAPEX show and were very satisfied with the accommodations. Rooms were clean. Breakfast was satisfactory. Employees were friendly. Hot tub was clean and hot. Pool area was clean. Overall, a good experience. Convenient to good restaurants, Del Frisco's, McCormick & Schmick's and others.</p><br>Great Off-Strip Hotel for Business Travel<p>I stayed at this property five nights in late October 2012, and liked everything about it. The rooms and public areas are updated and clean. The rate was very reasonable. The hotel offers the complimentary hot breakfast and social hour that are typical for Residence Inns, and does a good job with both. What I really, really like about this place is the quiet. It's around 0.9 miles from the strip, but it's in a neighborhood of office buildings, upscale condos, and upscale restaurants that is well insulated from heavy traffic. So, if you have desk work in the evening or a family that needs to get some sleep, this is a good choice. And if you want to visit the strip, it's no more than a 20-minute walk. I will go out of my way to stay here again.
Room Tip: Ask for a room away from the elevator, as the chime is fairly loud.

The room I had was a 1 bedroom suite, and whilst is was slightly dated and battered, it had all that was needed. This included a fridge and kitchenette, a good bathroom and a very comfortable bed with a big flatscreen TV.

I paid $99 and was happy with what I got, I did not manage breakfast the next morning but it was available.

If you are looking for a cheap stay in vegas without any frills, and within easy reach of teh strip then this is a good choice.</p><br>This is the place to stay in Vegas!<p>September 23, 2012 was my parent's 50th wedding anniversary. They originally had plans to go to Hawaii but due to a family emergency had to cancel at the last minute. On short notice, using my Marriott Rewards points, I was able to book two free nights for them at the Residence Inn Las Vegas Hughes Center. I selected it from among many Marriott properties because it is composed of full suites including a living room, bed room with two queen beds and a large kitchenette. It also provides free hot breakfasts, is very close to the strip, provides free parking, and charges no "resort fee". Prior to their arrival, I called the reservation desk and told the representative that this was a 50th anniversary celebration. I asked to purchase a basket of goodies to be placed in their suite prior to arrival. The Residence Inn representative was happy to put together a basket of goodies complete with wine, sweets, crackers and balloons. When I asked the price, he said it was "on the house" because 50th anniversaries are so rare these days. Upon arrival, my parents were greeted by all staff with the basket and "Happy 50th Anniversary!" My parents were shocked. The staff was very friendly throughout my parent's stay. My parents have stayed in hotels on the strip before and found this place to be much quieter, much more spacious, and more friendly than other locations but close to all the attractions. In the future, they will stay at the Residence Inn Las Vegas Hughes Center. I will as well. Thank you to all the Residence Inn staff who made my parent's 50th wedding anniversary so special! My parents asked that I post this review on their behalf.</p><br>Vegas Weekend!<p>Great service, free breakfast with a several choices from eggs to cereal and fruit.
We stayed at a 2 bedroom suite with kitchen, very clean and spacious. TV on each room as well as the living room. Clean pool, not crowded at all.
The only down side is that if you are not driving, Strip can be a little far away about 2-3 blocks. Taxi ride $15 approx. If you are driving you have the choice to leave your car at any Strip hotel to walk.
Nice and helpful staff.
Room Tip: They have 2 bedrooms perfect for groups of 6.
