<html><head><h3>Residence Inn Las Vegas Hughes Center Hotel Reviews Page 1</h3></head><body><br>Great visit<p>I really enjoyed my weeklong stay at this Marriott. I am quite picky when it comes to hotels and notice everything negative. I could find little to gripe about at this hotel. My room (1 bedroom w/ separate living room) was spacious, clean and complete. The kitchenette was nice and had most things needed to cook. It has two TVs and a desk. Breakfast was excellent with many choices (most bread or meat based). On Monday through Wednesday they provide food in the evenings (Tuesday was a full hamburger and salad meal). All employees were friendly. The location is about 1 mile from the strip (as the crow flies). Small nits they could improve on:
The furnace was really slow to increase the room temperature (it did eventually)
The exercise room needs more equipment</p><br>This place was just great<p>First it was spotless with snow white bed linens on both queens. We had a full size st. steel refrig. 2 electric cooktops, full-size coffee pot with coffee, new pots and pans and dishes and all the utensils we could need and a dishwasher (we did not cook). Flat screen TV, computer desk and small one in an ottoman cube. Plenty of drawers for 3 adults and closets as well.Had a mixer at night on Monday and Tuesday with free wine and beer and snacks and free sweets Wednesday evening with carrot cake and brownies. The breakfasts were to die for, scrambled eggs, boiled eggs, 2 kinds of fresh fruit, bagels with cream cheese, waffles with strawberries and whipped cream, oatmeal and everything to add to it and cold cereals and toast. I'm sure I may have forgotten something.
Room Tip: WIFI is not free on the strip, you are charged daily.Great mattresses and pillows and it was super q...

Green Features: They asked if we could not get fresh towels daily and since we don't at home why not. They are in a drought.</p><br>Godo place for family<p>I spent a weekned with my family al the hotel and ita your typical residence inn .free internet and free breakfast is always a plus . Hotel also hai complimentary self Parkig . Employees apre pretty friendly topo</p><br>Best Marriott Property for Convention Center<p>As a platinum rewards member I've stayed at 3 properties on the "Marriott island" just on the block right across from the convention hall and while they are convenient to walk back and forth (especially when exhibiting), I found this Hughes Center property is by far the better option and is only an $8 Uber away (up to $20 during peak hours though).

There are lots of eateries a stones throw from here and they offer significant discounts to hotel guests at Gordon Biersch and Bahama Breeze. Chipotle, Starbucks, a pizza and burger place all right here as well. Nice to have close decent options when you're on your feet all day and aren't here to play on the strip. On "Marriott island" there is really only the Courtyard cafe and the flagship lobby restaurant available that is walkable.

Access to the strip is very easy from here as you just take Flamingo (~$10 Uber). From most of the "Marriott island" properties the cabs have a 1-way the wrong way and have to double back and was usually at least $20 or more fare.

They offer a breakfast spread all week which is decent enough and also some smaller social eating events during the week nights which include free beer, wine, and snacks. Also (besides being a rewards member) when I'm here for work I prefer Marriotts since they don't have casinos attached and I'm there for a week at a time.

The only negative was in the room quality itself which was average for Marriott standards. I was in a 2 bedroom suite which was clean but starting to get just a bit tired. The window seals made a shrill tone in the wind (granted we were there during a wind storm). The air conditioner also made a shrill noise when on. The toilet made a consistent drip noise, and some of the bathroom tiles were cracked. Lighting in the bathroom is amazing though for make up, I want one at home.</p><br>Good choice for "near Strip" accommodations<p>The Residence Inn was modern and clean and a lot like other "upscale" extended stay hotels. We had a full kitchen but, unless you're truly in Vegas for an extended stay, I'm really not sure why you'd be cooking in Vegas.

With a car, I really liked the location. I'd guess about a mile from the heart of the Strip. With free parking at all the casinos, there's no real disadvantage to being in a non-gaming facility if you have a car. And it's certainly much easier to check-in and get to your room than when you're staying in a mega casino. Rooms are also nicer than most casino hotels, and the extra space is good.

I was slightly disappointed in breakfast because I remembered Residence Inn breakfasts being better than most "free" American motel breakfasts. This one was pretty average. Virtually inedible instant eggs. Completely inedible frozen blueberries as "the fruit." Mediocre sausage and biscuits. I might have preferred spending $10 bucks and gone to an off-strip casino buffet to eat. :)</p><br>One week in Vegas<p>Enjoying the stay here. The units are great for extended stays. The little kitchen is just perfect with some basic dishes, cook ware for the stove top, dishwasher and refrigerator. its quite. They have complimentary breakfast in the morning and its ok.</p><br>Perfect for what we needed<p>We stayed in a 2 room suite.

This Residence Inn is a lot like the others. There are some upgraded features. Service was excellent as always for Marriott but the rooms and living area were a bit smaller than normal but completely functional especially if you're only sleeping there between nights out on the strip. Speaking of the strip, this hotel is about a mile away and it is a quick cab or Uber ride away. I recommend Uber, personally.

My only complaints has to do with the heat/air conditioning. It was a cool weekend so we didn't run the air but in the bathroom there is a vent that constantly blows cools air. Even after a shower it is cold! And the heater didn't work very well at all. Set at 85 and was barely warmer than walking in from the hall. Although, both rooms and the living area had separate thermostats which was nice.

Overall, great value for the money just a couple of issues with the air.
Room Tip: Choose a room closer to elevator. Ours was waaaay down the hall and around a corner.

Green Features: This hotel is an environmentally friendly practices.</p><br>Good choice for Near Off-Strip<p>I booked a 1 bedroom suite at the Residence Inn. Some of the older reviews made me wonder about the quality of the rooms but with the recent renovation I don't see any issues. When you are reading other reviews make sure they are after the renovation.
The hotel is in a business/restaurant area across the street from the Tuscany. Lots of restaurants right outside the property like McCormick & Schmick's, Fogo de Chao, Chipotle, Starbucks and many others. One person mentioned they were uncomfortable in the neighborhood but I did not see anything that would have caused concern although there are signs outside the hotel doors stating that you need a room key to get in the main entrance. I never had to use mine while I was there but I was in the hotel by 8:30pm so I am guessing it is just a late night thing. The hotel was easy to get in to and well lit.

The staff were very friendly and helpful. The rooms were good. Plenty of space to stretch out in the 1 bedroom for 2 people. I think they could have used a little more substantial furniture but nothing that would cause a problem. Just seemed lightweight. The kitchen was well done and well equipped. Stove (no oven), microwave, coffee maker, toaster, plenty of dishes, glasses, pots & pans, and utensils including a low end wine opener. Full sized refrigerator with freezer. One package of popcorn was provided. Plenty of closet space. Hot water worked well. Rooms were clean.

Some people mentioned problems with noise and the AC unit. I did not have any unusual noises. Those reports concerned me because I am a light sleeper but it just wasn't an issue. The units do have the motion sensor to turn off the AC when it detects no movement. I can understand why a business would want to install these (probably saves them a ton of electricity) but when I want the room cool, I don't want the system trying to determine if I am there and throttling the temperature. I am not sure the detector was working correctly at night. When I first checked in to the room, the thermostat said 65 and so I left it there. It was not 65 degrees cold but was not warm.

They have an outdoor pool. Not large but adequate for the size of the hotel.
There is plenty of parking. Accidentally drove into the La Quinta about a block away and there were no parking spots there. People were parking in any place they could, against the curb, blocking the dumpster, etc. The Residence Inn did not have any issues in that area.

Incidentals: No in room safe. No lotion provided. The shampoo and conditioner bottles are really really tiny but they add new ones each day. The newspaper in the lobby is the local paper vs USA Today or the Wall Street Journal.

I thought breakfast was pretty good. Scrambled Eggs, Oatmeal, Waffles, Fruit, Yogurt, Cereal, Potatoes, Breads, Coffee, Milk, Juice.

In the end:
Pros: Good value, Updated Rooms, Good Kitchens in the room, Clean Rooms, Friendly & helpful Staff, Good restaurants nearby, Easy walk to the strip or quick cab ride, Had all the cooking appliances and gadgets I needed (Target and Albertsons are a short drive)
Cons: Can't think of any major issues other than the AC mentioned. That was about the only reason I could think of to not rate this hotel a 5 (and I wanted to). It is a 4.5

I would definitely stay here again for the price. I will be trying out two other hotels near the same category in Vegas over the next 2 months and it will be interesting to compare.
Green Features: No recycling containers in the room but they have the AC on a leash.</p><br>Great value <p>Loved the room. The continental breakfast. Great service. A little away from the strip but a great value. A quick cab ride away or a walk to the strip. We stayed at the MGM too & I would pick this over that any day.</p><br></body></html>
