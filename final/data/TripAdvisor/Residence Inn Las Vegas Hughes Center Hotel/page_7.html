<html><head><h3>Residence Inn Las Vegas Hughes Center Hotel Reviews Page 7</h3></head><body><br>Great place to stay when visiting the Strip<p>I booked a one bedroom queen suite for my family of 4. Free Internet, parking and breakfast were a few of the features that drew me to this hotel. It was also just 5 minutes drive from the major attractions on the strip. I found the hotel staff to be very helpful. Our suite was on the 6 th floor and one of the room windows was not shutting properly. This resulted in a cold draft and also the sound of rushing air through the night . When I reported it to the front desk, they promptly sent a service person, who duct taped the window leak and that took care of the problem. We asked for extra towels and these were delivered promptly. The breakfast starts at 6:30 am on weekdays and ends by 9 am. I wished they had extended it to 10 am, given that many showed up in the last half hour or so. The breakfast consisted of hot oatmeal, scrambled eggs, waffles, has browns, baked potato wedges, sausage patties. No bacon. There was plenty of fresh coffee and juices. The strawberries were frozen, but the peaches in syrup were quite nice. The were friendly and allowed us a late checkout to 1 pm instead of noon. Plenty of covered parking and open parking around the hotel. Many nice Indian and steak restaurants within walking distance.
Room Tip: When waiting in line for breakfast, first grab a quick coffee from the coffee bar, which usually has...

Good service.. If you are looking for a brand name hotel outside the strip, (but nearby the strip)... this is a great location.</p><br>Great location off the strip<p>Not a 4 or 5 star resort but a good place for relaxing and as long as you don't plan to spend time in the room you are good to go. The property is kept clean and maid service good.

The breakfast area is not large enough to handle the weekend crowds and the staff is unable to do anything about it. Recommend opening earlier to ensure that all can be served.</p><br>Great stay<p>Clean, hospitable...what more can you ask for... Breakfast was very busy, but staff did a great job. Lidia and Cesar did a great job. Kudos to you both!!! However, the fact that you need to post 200 words on order to post a review is silly. I am sure it limits the number of reviews.</p><br>Above avg<p>Staying here as i type. Have stayed at better residence inns. Very disappointed that i cant get coffee in the lobby at 10 AM. When I asked about this i was told that they take it away after breakfast and i could go next door to starbucks. This is a first as a platinum guest i have always had access to coffee 24/7 at residence Inns along with springhill suites, fairfield inns in my travels over the last 7 years and have never been told until today to go to starbucks next door. The room was fine or normal for the R.I. I will say they do a great job handling the enormous crowd at breakfast keeping up and keeping everything hot.</p><br>A nice hotel with a great location<p>This hotel offers nice accommodations including a kitchenette and just a ten minute walk to the Strip and only blocks from the Hard Rock. The staff are friendly and helpful when needed.

A complimentary continental buffet is available just off the lobby. The buffet includes scrambled eggs, make-your-own waffles and a variety of other items that change daily. Also includes packaged yogurt as well as vanilla yogurt with granola. There is also a social "hour" some afternoons with complimentary appetizers and beer and wine.

We had a room on the seventh floor and never had to wait more than a minute for an elevator. There is plenty of free parking on site.

The location is great as it's close enough to have easy access to the strip, but offers enough options to avoid the heavy traffic of the strip if you just want to get around town.</p><br>Decent hotel, but others are better<p>Been staying at this hotel multiple times over the last year and have see it going downhill. Overall the hotel and the staff are good. But, the towels are like sandpaper, the sheets feel over starched. The channel selection in the rooms is small compared to the competition.</p><br>Excellent service and awesome staff<p>I am here for work and thankfully, the area is removed from the vortex of Vegas. The staff has been very friendlyand helpful . The rooms are roomy and functional. TV is a new LG flat screen. The one quip is the lag time with the remote and tv. Kitchen is clean and stocked. I bought food at Trader Joe's and have eaten in the whole time. Breakfast has been good with eggs, cooked meats, and potatoes. You can also grab cold breakfast too. Monday and Tuesday nights, they provided free soup and salad then bugers on tuesday. Those night time meals were of low quality though. I ate it. I would recommend this for business, as I am here for that. For families, I would stay here too. Internet in rooms works well. Fitness room could use a better bike and the computer in computer room has funky internet. I would rather have more functional google chrome or explorer, which enables you to open multiple windows instead of opening multiple pages.That aside, I strongly recommend this place.</p><br>They need to vacuum the floor<p>Both my husband and I noticed that our socks turned black walking in the carpet. We did complain upon check out that the refrigerator was very noisy at night, we don't know why. We requested and got a 2 bed studio , so we were fine. Hot breakfast was filling but maybe they can unload the trash cans faster so guests can dispose of their styro plates properly. Internet connection was good. We stayed here November 23,2014.</p><br>Tucked Away<p>This hotel is off of the Vegas strip and in a nice quiet location. If you looking to go to the strip, you are only a few blocks away. There are quite a few restaurants surrounding this hotel within walking distance. The front staff was very pleasant and the rooms are really spacious with full equipped kitchens. The beds are really comfortable and overall it was a really good stay.

This was a business trip for me and I am always looking for a good nights rest after a hard working day and this location fits the bill. Will be back when I am back in town.</p><br></body></html>
