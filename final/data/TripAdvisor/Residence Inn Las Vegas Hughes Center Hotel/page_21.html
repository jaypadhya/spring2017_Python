<html><head><h3>Residence Inn Las Vegas Hughes Center Hotel Reviews Page 21</h3></head><body><br>Great location<p>Stayed here for 4 weeks on business and I would definately stay there again if I returned for pleasure. 15/20 min walk from the strip or a 2 min taxi ride if your like me and your lazy! Very friendly staff who were always there to help if needed.

We were in a one room suite with twin beds and even with 2 of us sharing there was plenty of space!

The only minor point is that the fitness suite was very small with limited equipment.

Thank you Marriott for another enjoyable stay at one of your hotels.</p><br>Las Vegas with Kids -- good choice<p>We came to LV mainy to get to the Grand Canyon and Death Valley.. I didn't want to be in a casion based hotel (we saw enough of them sightseeing). This Marriott is about 20 mins walk from the strip, has conveient restaurants, laundry facilities and basic cooking bits in your room -- so you don't have to have every meal out.
Staff were very courteous, beds comfortable and no raucous gamblers staggering down the corridors at 4am -- what more could you want.</p><br>Good business hotel<p>Rooms are large, clean, and quiet. And no need to walk through an enormous smoky casino to get to the elevator bank. Several good restaurants are within walking distance (e.g. Gordon Biersch, McCormack and Smichks (sp?)) and a Starbucks is across the parking lot). Decent hot breakfast for no charge.</p><br>Great stay. Loved it!<p>Very accommodating. Great rooms. Quick to bring extra pillows.</p><br>Fantastic service and very friendly<p>I stay here every time I visit Las Vegas (3 or 4 times a year) and absolutely love it. The staff is always friendly, the rooms are always clean and even the guests feel like family. The breakfast buffet is awesome (waffles!) and the proximity to the Strip.</p><br>Best Residence Inn in Vegas<p>This property is easily the nicest with the best location. You are steps away from Casinos & Restaurants and about 20 minutes walking from the strip. The breakfast was good, the parking is covered, and the social hour has lots of good food and alcohol. Choose this one over the South and Convention Center properties if you are looking for a good vacation close to downtown. It's usually the cheapest too.

We walked across the street to Terrible's Casino and my gf won $200 on penny slots! Ridiculous really. The staff was really nice and the pool/hot tub were superb.

If you want really nice rooms though, do NOT choose this location. The rooms are in desperate need of a renovation. We only stayed one night so it wasn't that big of a deal for us, but no way I could stay a week here. I am really surprised how behind they seem to be with refurbishments. The appliances/furniture seem to be at least 10 years old.</p><br>Nice quiet Marriott about 15 minutes from the strip. Loved it.<p>Was in Vegas on business, and we ended up here. At first the location was a letdown, being off the strip, but really it wasn't all that bad of a walk -- 15 minutes down Paradise puts you at Bellagio/Ceasar's -- and the upside was a very quiet hotel that you could come back to after the craziness of the strip.

Check-in went smoothly and efficiently. Had a 1-room suite, and it was very nice, clean, and spacious. I didn't have housecleaning come in, since I was only there three nights, but based on the room when I arrived I'm sure they would have done a great job. The A/C was adequate and shockingly the windows open should you want some sound/breeze.

The breakfast buffet was pretty standard, but better than most -- fruit, yogurt (even low-fat kinds), cereals, muffins, pastries, sausage, omlettes, etc. Since it was included in the price, I can't complain.

The hotel is very close to many restaurants that are far cheaper than anything you'll find on the strip -- ask the front desk for a 10% off card to Gordon Biersch. Such a good restaurant, great food at good prices.

I would def. go back. Quiet, clean, and a quick walk to the strip. Oh, and free parking! Try finding that elsewhere!</p><br>Met all our expectations<p>Nice clean and quiet. Breakfast offering was was average but they did not run out of anything and accomodated trays and slightly late arrivals. Staff was friendly and helpful. Michelle at front desk was great. Stayed three nights.

Door tags for room make up and do not disturb are unusual and easy to mis use.

Nice mattresses and air conditioning control.
Room Tip: call hotel direct if you have special room needs

The front desk staff accommodated our request for an early (10AM) check-in after a long, early flight which we appreciated. We had a room with a great view, windows that opened, and a comfortable bed. The decor is a bit dated, but that didn't bother us. Generally housekeeping did a fine job, although the furniture needed better dusting. Again, not a big problem. The kitchen and bathroom were spotless. The breakfast was typical for a Residence Inn, meaning not gourmet but adequate and, of course, free. Plenty of options from eggs to waffles to bagels to cereal. The setting (Hughes Center) is very pleasant with lots of tree lined streets. Not a long drive to the Strip, but really you should have a rental car if you stay at this hotel. Since all the casinos offer free self parking, the short drive to them was very convenient. Best of all, the hotel was very quiet and is non-smoking. It was a welcomed place to return to after spending time with the crowds in the casinos. And the staff were very friendly and helpful. All in all, a great stay. Kudos to the staff.</p><br>Excellent choice for off-strip lodging.<p>Good experience all around. Family enjoyed the pool, room was clean and comfortable. Very good gov't rates, especially since breakfast, internet, etc are included.</p><br></body></html>
