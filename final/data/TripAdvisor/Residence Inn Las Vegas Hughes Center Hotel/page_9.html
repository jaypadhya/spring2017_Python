<html><head><h3>Residence Inn Las Vegas Hughes Center Hotel Reviews Page 9</h3></head><body><br>below expectations<p>I've stayed at other Residence Inns and had better experiences. Compared to other similar hotels (to include other Residence Inns), the rooms are very small, and I felt clausterphobic. The breakfast area was ok and well stocked, but the general feel of the hotel was depressing. Maybe it's because of the location in Vegas, but as a regular business traveler, I hope I don't have to stay there again. Location was ok for me as I had business in the Wells Fargo building. Their are chain resturuants within walking distance. It's a long walk to the Strip, or a short cab ride. There's usually one or two cabs waiting out front; otherwise, I found one passed by every so often.</p><br>Handy Location<p>This hotel is close to the airport, although they do not offer a hotel van for guests. Not a problem, a taxi was only about $15 which included a tip. ... The room was comfortable and clean. The WiFi worked well and there was a good breakfast which started early. The front desk staff were friendly and welcoming. We were satisfied with our stay and would recommend it to others. (If driving, take the Flamingo Exit off I-15 and go east.)
Room Tip: The bell on the elevator is set too loud. I would recommend not staying too close to the lifts.

Green Features: As with other Marriott properties, they seem to be in step with current environment steps to conserve.</p><br>Great Experience!<p>Stayed at this hotel for 2 days on Labor Day weekend. Location was great, away from the hustle bustle of the strip but not that far, about 10 min drive. It was surrounded by nice restaurants: Fogo de Chao, Gordon Birsch, McCormick, Lawrys. Staff was friendly, room is clean, building is well-maintained. Breakfast buffet was great as well and dining area was spacious but still tends to get packed during peak hours so you should plan to come early as they suggest. Check-in time was 4pm but we came around 3pm and were allowed to check-in. We were so tired from traveling for more than 4 hours from Los Angeles so we appreciated that so much. Overall experience was really great and will surely come back.</p><br>A Mile from the Strip-Calm and Caring Service<p>Tonight is my first night at the Residence Inn Las Vegas Hughes Center. The front desk staff welcomes you warmly. The rooms are in excellent condition. Breakfast is available in the morning. I walked to the Strip and back in the evening and felt pretty safe, but I would suggest taking a taxi in the evening for added security. I LOVE walking. If you enjoy a good walk or a pool and jacuzzi to take in the rays, enjoy this peaceful hotel with the extra space that the Marriott Residence brand provides. I would bring my family for leisure.
P.S. The Hard Rock, McCormicks and Schmicks, Landry and many other hotels are just a minute walk.
Room Tip: I stayed on the fifth floor and there was hardly any outdoor noise.

The place is clean, well run, great service,and has all the amenities of Residence Inn (full kitchen, breakfast every morning, gym, etc.) Highly recommended.</p><br>Good one night option coming to and from the airport<p>We got in late to Vegas and wanted a place to stay away from the strip before leaving the next morning for Zion. On the way back from ZNP, we needed a place for a one night stay again before leaving the next morning to return home. This hotel had a very friendly and easy check-in. Free parking was in a garage right behind the hotel with easy access to the elevators.

The rooms were comfortable and clean and the breakfast in the morning was well stocked with several employees working hard to clear tables and keep everything stocked. There are several restaurants within walking distance. We ate at Gordon Biersch and enjoyed our meal and drinks. It was a Monday evening and there was a manager meal of chicken we opted to not eat but it looked like lots of guests were enjoying it.

The hotel is close to a Starbucks for a morning coffee, a gas station to refill the rental car before heading to the airport, and a Fed Ex in case you did too much shopping.

The hotel is ~15 minutes from the airport. We would definitely stay here again if in Vegas again.
Room Tip: There are office buildings close by so pick a higher level to avoid hearing traffic

Pool is a bit basic but car park is good. There are good places nearby to eat and the free breakfast is good. Staff were friendly and efficient.
Disadvantage is that it's a bit far from the strip but there are buses and taxis.
Room Tip: Better views up high. Fairly quiet area.

Green Features: Not sure about these but seems a sensible hotel. They did not make a feature of this.</p><br>Worked well for our short stay<p>We were in Vegas for 8 nights - 7 at the Grand Chateau and needed a place for extra night before flying home on Saturday. We had a free Marriott night so chose the Residence Inn which was perfect for our last night in town. It’s off the strip but close to restaurants. Breakfast was crowded but well stocked and we were there early so didn’t have to wait in much line. Always like having kitchenette and we did enjoy the pool in the afternoon. I would recommend this hotel for the price and if you want to be off the strip but close to UNLV.</p><br>Decent hotel. Bad internet, small gym/pool, public laundry.<p>My overall stay at the hotel was not a bad experience. Everyone was friendly and helpful. There is breakfast every morning and dinner on Mondays/Tuesdays/every other Wednesday. There is a small shop where you can pick up wine, beer, snack food, soda, tea, and microwaveable items. The room is fairly cozy. It had a couch, chair, desk, office chair, two bar stools, small counter top bar, small kitchen, large fridge, decent closet space, single dresser, two nightstands, large bathroom mirror, and a small full bathroom separate from the bathroom sink.

There are some drawbacks to this hotel though through the amenities. The rooms do not have washers/dryers like in other extended stay hotels. You are forced to pay $3 to wash and dry your clothes in a central wash room on 3 of the floors, each containing 2 washers/dryers. The internet is free, unless you pay to upgrade the bandwidth. The drawback to the internet is that the service provider/equipment that the hotel has is horrible. Even if you pay to have the faster internet, you still have tons of packet loss and high latency, even during non-peak hours. If you are a gamer, avoid the thought of even playing while here. It is probably at the top of my list for worst hotel internet connection. I notified the business and was given a code to use to try and remedy the issues with the connection (as I need the internet for work) and the issues were not resolved. If you are athletic and like to workout, the gym has a few cardio machines and free weights. The gym is absolutely lacking. The pool is small and usually full of kids. There is a decent hot tub.

TL;DR:
-Good service
-Decent room
-Free breakfast everyday
-Free dinner Mondays/Tuesday/every other Wednesday
-Off the strip, but close enough to everything
-Horrible free/paid internet
-Public laundry
-Small pool
-Hot tub
-Tiny gym
Room Tip: A room facing towards the strip has its perks. View of the strip and the pool.

It is so much easier to get to the room without having to go through the casino. This property would work best for people who has a rental car, otherwise staying on the Strip would be most convenient. The free breakfast in the morning is a plus. There is no resort fee charge which can add quite a bit to the room cost.
Room Tip: High floor, away from elevator
