<html><head><h3>Rodeway Inn Convention Center Motel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 2</h3></head><body><br>Eyesore, No Air Conditioning <p>This place is ran down. We had a free night with a choice hotel, we figured it can't be that bad. Boy, were we wrong. This place doesn't look appealing or inviting. It appears your driving in a back drug alley somewhere in a undesirable neighborhood. The parking lot is built horribly. Even though this hotel is pet friendly, there is no where for your dog to go potty. Scorning hot sun and blacktop is all that is around this hotel. I was able to go across the street and walk down and found some real grass (some grass is fake). The building contained walls that had welded window cut outs, that made the walkway to the room extremely hot and unbearable. The rooms were big as far as sq footage goes but that about it. Old tvs (good channel selection), air conditioner didn't really work at all, the room stay warm the whole entire stay. The water pressure in shower was nonexistent and the water didn't get hot or cold. Then the room had a funny odor. Pool area was super small. The hotel didn't feel secure at all. The maid banged on door at nine am, even though check out wasn't until noon. She came back a total of three times before check out. How annoying. It was close to a 24 hour Denny's. As a choice Platinum member they could/should have accommodated me better than the treatment I received. I do not recommend this hotel and will never return. Glad it was a free night.</p><br>Starting to show wear and tear<p>Well, its been four years since we wrote a review of the Rodeway, and in the intervening four years, the hotel has obviously taken a beating from all the visitors that have stayed there. It is still a great value, its close to the Las Vegas Convention Center (within walking distance), you can park very close to your room and not have to hike long distance from the parking to your room, there are no slot machines on the premises, so its quiet, there are retail services very near by (pharmacy, Peppermill Restaurant)....but the paint, the carpets, the draperies, the bathrooms, the furniture, the doors, the door jams, caulking, the common areas, the corridors.....all are starting to show their age and could use some refurbishment, repainting, replastering and repairs. The hotel is definitely starting to look and feel "tired". Its still well located, and still a good choice if you need a budget accommodation or a quiet place. The nearby Rivera has been sold and is slated for demolition, so there may be a construction noise and dust issue in the future.
Room Tip: There are no elevators. The rooms at the back are a long way from the front desk and the swimming p...

The value was excellent - the room was clean, with enough space for the three of us to move about. Beds were comfortable, and the mattresses did not sag in toward the middle. The check-in guy was straight-forward - not rude, but also not charming. Free wifi was great.

The hallways were a little dingy-looking, (but that is probably because they are open-air), and the parking area seemed a little sketchy. I slept with earplugs and so was not bothered by the very loud air conditioner that would turn on and off at random - it disturbed by friends' sleep, though.

Breakfast consisted of bagels, toast, muffins, and cold cereal, with hot and cold beverages (I would have liked some fruit), which seemed generous on acount of the inexpensive price.

I would stay here again, as long as those in my party were okay with a loud air conditioner.</p><br>Just Average<p>Hard to get in the driveway,the view out of my window was bums sleeping in parking lot next to hotel! No coffee maker in room. No do not disturb sign either so when I left in the morning the maid cleaned my room & left my curtains wide open all day for everyone to see my stuff!
Breakfast closes at 930am so the "cook" told us all to go eat outside even if we were in the middle of eating. Outside tables were full of people smoking cigarettes!</p><br>About what I expected <p>I stayed at the Rodeway Inn during Memorial Day Weekend. I had been in town for a week and stayed at some pretty nice properties, including The Cosmopolitan, The Luxor, & The Tropicana but didn't have a room for my last night in town. Being that it was MDW rates at every hotel were over the top high. After reading reviews and finding the best rate at the
The Rodeway, I decided to stay there. It's close to the Wynn and the Trump and near the strip. Upon arrival, the hotel is definitely run down outside. The check in personnel was friendly and provided directions to the room, free wifi, and a map. The room was decent, and clean enough. However, the trash was not emptied from a previous guest (just a few paper items) and there was a used towel behind the door of the bathroom. Also, the TV remote didn't work and the Front Desk person said he'd bring up a new one & some pillows but it took hours. Overall though, for this type of hotel and what it was needed for im not going to be too harsh with my criticisms. This is a cheaper motel so your expectations need to be accordingly. I wouldn't "chose" to stay here again but I wouldn't not recommend it to other travelers looking for a deal.</p><br>Average<p>I stayed on here hoping I could save some money (which I did). It was actually fairly clean which was nice but the place is pretty beat up and scary at times. I found some blood on the stairs while I was going upstairs which seemed a bit strange to me. Otherwise it was a good deal and fairly close to the strip. I can't say that I'll stay again but in a pinch, I wouldn't mind.</p><br>ok for the money<p>We were on our way back from vacation and needed a place to stay for the night to rest and eat. It's about a block off the strip, so you don't here the noise of the strip. The staff was very friendly, but did not seem to know that their pool was closed till when ever. The room was very big, the bed was nice. The only problems we had were some one after 2AM kept trying to get in our room with their key card and then the people next to our head board woke us up pounding the wall with their head board and screaming. It is in a scarry part of the town next to the Rivera kind of, they do have a locked corridor that you have to go into to get to your room. They do serve a breakfast but since we were woke up so often and so late into the night we over slept and missed it.</p><br>Outside needs work but rooms were clean! Cheap too<p>We were only staying one night on our way out to California. Arrived very late at night. The locale is kinda scary and the outside of the hotel has seen better days. However, the rooms were neat and clean and very quiet, even for a Saturday night. Beds were comfy and you can't beat the cheap price. We had no problems here at all.</p><br>Nice, cheap motel just off strip.<p>Nice location that is just off the strip near the Riviera (closing 5/4/15) and Circus Circus (which is still a dump). Rodway is an old hotel, probably 1950’s. Room 210 is right above the lobby and had a great view of the pool and nearby hotels, but was quiet with the AC on which worked well. Could not connect to the internet at all the first night, worked fine the next morning. Towels in bathroom had black hairs on them. The room is large. As mentioned in other reviews, parking is very odd, and the neighborhood feels a little seedy. Old style tube TV’s with about 50 channels, my remote did not work. Checkin was easy for me, but the couple in front of me took forever. They were very annoying and others in the lobby were just obnoxious (it is very loud lobby). Room 210 was spacious, bathroom was small, dated and had lights that not only didn’t flatter you, but made my teeth look horrific. Counter was large, towels are thin and rough, it took up to 5 minutes to get hot water. I slept good in the bed, which was much better than I expected. No sprinklers, but smoke detectors. Room smelled funny, not sure if it was paint, cleaner or the A/C, but I woke up with a headache the next morning. Loud noise from skydiving facility next door, so sitting by the pool is not pleasant. I paid $44.99 + 12% tax on a Saturday night, which was significantly cheaper than the casino hotels. Note there is no casino here, you have to walk to Riviera or Circus Circus, both are about 5 minutes away. Wynn/Encore is about a 10 minute walk. Since the motel is not on the strip, access from the east is very easy. Breakfast was very basic, I walked to Denny’s which is 5 minutes away on strip (great service).
Room Tip: Room 210 above the lobby was spacious and nice, but not near your car
