<html><head><h3>Rodeway Inn Convention Center Motel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 13</h3></head><body><br>Great place to be ? beste plek om te verblijven<p>we stayed here in march this year. it is great, no check in time, what we saw at the greater hotels on the strip.
it is only a few steps away from the strip and the busstop.
around the corner there is a walgreen and a dennies. and a lot of souveniershops.
the riviera is only 3 minuts away.
we were from the netherlands and stayen in our big rooms only the morning and the night to sleep. all the personal was verry kind asking for an other rooms was not difficult.
if were going again to LV, then surthenly to this motel/motel.
and ther is always thea and coffee in the loby and indeed free wireless internet.</p><br>Decent, but some problems<p>We read reviews on this place before choosing it, so we knew we weren't heading for the Taj Mahal or anything. We booked it through Travelocity. Our check-in was completed by a young woman on the phone the whole time, without any real professionalism or greeting.

Our room, however, was clean, spacious, conveniently located and most importantly to us, quiet. There's a 24 hour Walgreens down the street, as well as a 24 hour food court in the Riviera Hotel, which is not a far walk. There's a Denny's nearby also. We bought food at the Walgreens and were able to keep stuff in the mini fridge the Villa Roma provided. There is a microwave in the lobby.

We woke up the first morning of our stay and there was no hot water. We were informed the hot water tank broke and they moved us to another room, which had a different tank connection. I started packing our stuff and my husband checked the water in the second room. It also lacked hot water, so we were given another room to move to. We moved all our stuff to the new room and went out for the day.

The next day, all the water in the whole hotel was shut off. Originally they said it would be fixed at 3pm. We came back to the hotel around 6pm to a hoard of angry guests in the lobby complaining about the lack of water. After we had been moved out of our rooms, the hotel continued to check people into the very same rooms we were moved from, knowing there was no hot water.

My husband and I called Travelocity to arrange a refund and we checked out of the hotel early, not wanting to have to worry about hot water for the rest of our vacation.

If it weren't for the hot water issue, we would have stayed at the Villa Roma. It was nothing special, but it was cheap and convenient, not far from the Strip.

We did not use the pool (it was much too cold when we were there) but it was clean.</p><br>Great Secret!<p>"Rooms have all been remodeled, are clean and very big. For the price it is great! No fancy extras though if you are looking for that kind of thing. Only a block off the Strip so easy to get to as it is right before the Rivera as you head north on Las Vegas Blvd. There is a Walgreens, Dennys & the Peppermill restaurant all within a block which was nice.

We actually took the City Bus(the 108) from the airport (ask for directions of how to find the stop at the airport as it is kinda tucked away on the 'Zero Floor') to the Convention Center and walked the block and half to the hotel only a $1.25 each! Great deal if you are looking to save your money for gambling or food. =) It takes some time though on the bus, so if you are in a hurry to check in, take a taxi."</p><br>Villa Roma MOTEL - OK!!<p>Feb 2008 for 3 nights
Since it was winter could not use the pool but I guess I would not have used it anyway, it's not tempting: small and caged, not many room for sunbathing.
The frontdesk attendants were incredibly helpful!
Complimentary coffe is ok.
Be aware that the wi-fi internet access is only available at the lobby, they should change that to the entire motel. I don't see the difficult of that. However, it worked ok.
Stayed in a single king sized bed, non smoker. It was clean, no smell, and huge. Heard no noises, great!
Bathroom was very nice!
Roomservice was excellent.
Half block away from the strip.
Excellent for the price we payed!</p><br>Villa Roma Great Value!<p>My husband and I traveled to Las Vegas for a tradeshow in February. We were a little nervous when we saw the outside of the Villa Roma Inn...not exactly attractive, but for $59/night it was well worth it.
They are in the process of updating the flooring, so there were tile layers in our hallway, but it was a very minor inconvenience. The rooms are larger than most, with a small refrigerator, and updated bathrooms that actually have a vent fan in them! We could shower and still see in the mirror the same day! The staff was very friendly, and allowed us to store our luggage their until our tradeshow was over. Good location...just 1 block off the strip and short walk to Walgreens, Denny's, and many other places.
Would definitely stay there again for business.
Don't go for the pool - very minimal with a view of a parking lot.</p><br>Good Price, Good Room<p>We stayed at the Villa Roma Motel during the Nascar Race. I found it to be a good place to stay, the rooms were clean and large, the staff was friendly, and it's in a great location. Many places to eat and the strip was right there. I also liked the Walgreens and 7-11 in close walking distance, good for coffee and food. Couple of things I did not like was the parking, it's so tight and if you have a truck good luck, and I wish they offered coffee makers in the rooms, (they do in the lobby, but the cups are about 3 sips worth). Other than that very good place to stay!!</p><br>Good basic motel - would stay here again<p>A basic motel in a good location -- if you don't mind walking/driving to the hot spots. Parking is free. Room is clean. Don't be put off by the front/lobby -- the rooms are ok. Receptionist told me that this will soon become a chain motel -- and you can see that they are already at work doing upgrades to the pool area (new tiles).

Wi-fi doesn't work in the rooms -- only in the lobby and by the pool.</p><br>This motel is a great find!<p>I would rate this motel at a "5". The room was clean and spacious. The motel staff was very helpful. The motel is about a 1/2 block from the strip. The Rivera is just across the parking lot and Walgreen's, 7-11, Denny's ,McDonald's and Circus Circus are in the same area. It is also close to the Monorail. The room had the basic amenities such as a iron and ironing board and a hair dryer. There was no coffee maker, but I don't drink coffee, so it wasn't a big deal. The bathroom was very clean. It was also quiet. The room entrances are all inside and you need your room key to get into the building. I wish I would of found this place the last time I was in Vegas! I think the motel should have higher than a 1 star rating. Don't be detoured by the rating, I think it is at least a 2. I felt safe staying there. I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a reasonably priced room without all the negatives that usually come from a cheaper motel. It was too cold to use the pool, but it was clean to. I will be staying here during my next trip to Vegas!</p><br>Good value<p>Easy access to Las Vegas Blv. and Paradise Road. Clean and spacious room with comfortable bed. Good rates for the time period that we stayed easy check in and check out, good place just to sleep, close to other anemities.
Concerns are the dark areas in the hallways and stairways when arriving late at night. Would recommend this hotel for visitors to convention ,center those who enjoy walking the strip or exploring .
Would not recommend location for honeymon or romantic getaways. We frequently travel to LasVegas and have stayed at many locations ( high and low ends). Overrall motel met all our needs and expections.</p><br>Great Value<p>Because of the inexpensive rates, our club has held its board meeting at the Villa Roma for the last couple of years. The Villa has a nice meeting room just the right size. Don't be fooled by the look of the motel from the outside -- the rooms are nearly as nice as any on the strip. The location on Convention Center drive is handy -- just a short walk to the strip and near Slots of Fun, Riviera, Wynn and just across the street from the Greek Isle.</p><br></body></html>
