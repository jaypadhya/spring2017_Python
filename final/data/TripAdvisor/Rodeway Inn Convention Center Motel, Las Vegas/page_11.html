<html><head><h3>Rodeway Inn Convention Center Motel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 11</h3></head><body><br>Grat place to stay for everybody<p>Great motel, you get much more than you pay for! Cheap motel in price but very good in service.They have nice and clean rooms.</p><br>Calming down in Vegas<p>Small B&B close to the Strip. Comfortable rooms including a big bathroom. It was value for money and in the face of its neighborhood well silenced.</p><br>very good value for money; good location; clean rooms/ very bad breakfast<p>i have stayed in this hotel for 3 nights, the reception staff were very friendly and helpful.
they offered us a bigger room for the same price...
The rooms where clean and in correct order.
If there is one thing i really dislike it was the breakfast, dont even go and try it.. the worst coffe ever and the pastries were almost frozen. no juices, no cereals etc.
i was not expecting the hilton`s breakfast but a bit more of care would have been nice .</p><br>I would stay here again, Just make sure you buy the $7.00 shuttle ticket<p>the room was spacious, clean, dust free and welcoming. It smelled fresh. The bath was also very clean. You get two small soaps and one tiny bottle of shampoo.
The strip is just a little bit of a walk. The Circus Circus Hotel/Casino is the closest one to this hotel. I would definitely stay here again. Its hassle free. My room did not have a fridge. Next that i stay...i will ask for one. Walgreens,Dennys, Indoor Skydiving and Ross stores are within walking distance. Another helpful idea is paying $7.00 for the shuttle and it will take you where you want all day for the same price. No regrets!</p><br>Not too bad<p>I would say "not too bad". Very close to the strip. Very good price. Clean room. Nice pool. Only breakfast was below average. People were helpful and kind. Thanks to the Tripadvisor members for sharing their experience. It helped to make the right choice.</p><br>Nice, spacious rooms, but it has its cons.<p>I booked a room well in advance, so I got very decent rate.
Rooms were impressively spacious (I have read somewhere, that it used to be Best Western), but they were missing firidge, coffee maker and microwave, typical for other Rodeway Inns. OK, as we changed the room I saw a fridge in one of the other rooms, so I guess it depends. Rooms were clean, perhaps not quite spotless, but acceptable.
The room we got initially (just after the reception) was adjacent to some VERY noisy fan located in the next building, but I asked for another room and we got it. On the other side of the building there is some restaurant, but fans were not that noisy, so it was ok.
The staff was OK, but you would not call them friendly nor very helpful.
Breakfast was poor comparing to other motels - just coffee, cereals with milk and some danish.
Location is fair - half a block away from Las Vegas Blvd. About 1-2 blocks from Riviera, Circus Circus and Encore. Sahara is about 3 blocks away. Taxi to the Bellagio area was about 12USD.
There is also a small pool, did not use, but we've seen some teenagers jumping into it. (It was about 70F at that time).</p><br>Decent, fair.<p>Upside: cheap, reasonably friendly staff, fairly good location (a half-hour walk to the center Strip), easy access to transportation, good ammenities in the block (Wallgreens, souvenirs, 7-eleven...), parking , internet and breakfast included.

Downside: a bit stinky, no frig, only a small shampoo bottle, someone passing by your only window every now and then, no elevators (2 floors), tiny breakfast room (you might need to wait to sit in the coldest days, when eating outside is not possible), very simple breakfast.

Bottom line: do not come if a bit of comfort is more important than saving.</p><br>Good location if you are attending a convention<p>If you are going to Las Vegas JUST for a convention, this is the place to stay to avoid the long cab lines after the show. I just went to the NAB convention and the hotel is within easy walking distance from the convention center. However, I found that a lot of my colleagues were staying at great hotels on the strip and paying basically the same rate as I was paying for this "budget hotel". The hotel is not very close or within walking distance to anything but the convention hall. The neighborhood is not that great...I would not go walking around at night alone for instance. A few minor annoyances: no coffee pot or minibar in the room so if you stay bring your own water! The AC was functional but VERY noisy. The place was clean but outdated and the staff were terrific. They really went out of their way to accommodate any request. However, if you are going to LV on vacation, try the better hotels on the strip and negotiate a price. They are all underbooked because of the economy so you can get great deals right now.</p><br>Just Fine For Our Quick Stay<p>This was a good enough, clean enough, inexpensive place to spend the night in Las Vegas on the way to So. California. The woman at the front desk was friendly.

Our room was very clean, comfortable and larger than average for a two queen beds room. The beds were fine. Don't expect anything extra. If you need an extra pillow bring your own.

If you are expecting free wi-fi in your room, don't. The motel's web page says it's free but there is a charge.

The free breakfast would most likely be considered sub-par by most folks. All I needed though was some coffee and a cellophane bagged pastry to wake me up, so it worked. My kid had some cereal. It's served in a crowded little room. The attendant was pleasant and cheerful.

We paid about $40 for a Saturday night. This was an amazing deal.

By-the-way, we stayed at Sam's Town on the way back on a Sunday Night for about $30. Sam's Town was much fancier, but smokey (from cigs) and more difficult to get in and out of. All in all, I think I'd rather stay at this Rodeway if I'm in a hurry.</p><br>Convenient location, very good rooms, and decent value.<p>Stayed here for four nights with my wife--I attended a conference while she toured. Hotel doesn't look like much from outside but it was secure and well-maintained. Our room was well-kept and spacious. We requested a fridge and hotel staff was happy to provide one. They also were responsive to other requests. Unlike most Vegas hotels, breakfast and Internet were included (although breakfast was very plain). Location is excellent: very close to Riviera, Convention Center, and Strip. Convenience stores and a few restaurants are nearby.

Overall, a great way to stay near the Strip. I've stayed at the big hotels before, and the nice thing about this hotel is that you avoid the long walk to your room and the smoky casino. This hotel is well managed and maintained.</p><br></body></html>
