<html><head><h3>Rodeway Inn Convention Center Motel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 3</h3></head><body><br>Place needs serious updating<p>I wish the rooms looked as good as the pictures!
Wi-fi was weak all the time
Shower changed temps from hot to cold to scalding and back every day. 2 outlets in the whole room. Had to move furniture to plug in laptop so I could work in a very dimly lit room, with low wattage bulbs. Hope you don't want to charge your phone and see it at the same time. outlets were near the floor behind bed or dresser.
Continental Breakfast offered no healthy options. Danish, bagels, cereal, milk, coffee and Sunny Delight. No juice or fruits at all.

Stayed 4 nights for a business trip - Never again. Had to stay there due to 3 large conventions in town.
Room Tip: Stay away from the side that has the indoor skydiving next to it. It really gets loud when they turn...

The owners are aware of the problem, as many guests complain, but they won't spend the money to fix it. Otherwise this is a decent Rodeway Inn, and the staff are very helpful.</p><br>I've seen better<p>While the hotel isn't technically on the strip, it's basically just a few minute walk away so that was really convenient.

When I drove up, I was a little turned off by the exterior which is definitely not too impressive. Parking is available around the building but the spots are really tiny and there isn't a whole lot of space to drive so it's a bit nerve-wrecking trying to avoid driving into longer cars.

The hotel lobby is rather small but nice. There i a tiny front desk window, an area for coffee, a desk with a computer and a seating area. It was clean and the young man checking me in was very friendly and welcoming.

As I walked up to my room on the second floor, I continued to feel a bit uncomfortable as the stairway and the hallway to the room (which is semi-outside) is in major need of a makeover. So I was bracing myself for the worst when I put my key card into the reader to open my door.

But I was pleasantly surprised as the rooms were very clean and spacious. The bed was big and quite comfy, I like it a bit more firm and the bed was definitely that. There is a desk in case you have to work right next to a TV. Two nightstands, a big closest and lots of space which was very nice. The bathroom was very clean and looked new. It has a bathtub/shower. Unfortunately just like so many other hotels, the shower head was designed for short people. I'm six feet so not outrageously tall but I had to duck a lot just to wet my hair which was not fun. Please be aware that that the water does not get hot. I turned it all the way up and it was lukewarm at best but at least it had great water pressure.

They have free Wifi but it's incredibly spotty and slow, I got disconnected several times and it took forever to load websites.

The thing that was really difficult for me and affected my ranking tremendously was the outside noise. Loud motorcycles, somewhat loud housekeeping, people walking past the door, planes flying by and I could hear basically everyone next or below to my room. I walk up so many times, it really affected my experience.

So in a nutshell, great rooms but everything else was below average. You save a lot of money staying here so depending on your priorities this may be a decent option but since I value a good night sleep more, I will probably not return but I definitely didn't hate it.</p><br>WEEKEND PRICES that WORK<p>I was having to travel to Vegas on a Saturday and as you may not know, the hotel prices in Vegas on Friday and Saturday night explode to great heights......yet I found this very clean and average hotel for only $72 on a Saturday night.....GREAT DEAL!!!!!! Minutes from the Wynn Hotel where one would pay seven times this amount for a Saturday night stay and trust me if you are only using the room to sleep well go with CLEAN and WELL KEPT place.....
Room Tip: If you are only using the room to sleep and not worried about the extras....go ahead and book it

Its a tired, old hotel, situated about a block off of the strip. The location and outside appearance may give you pause. The location immediately around the hotel is dark and deserted, but I encountered no problems nor did I see anything of concern. The room itself was large, with a dated appearance. It was clean enough. I stayed here twice, flying in and then flying out. The first time I had a coffee maker, but the second time no. You might want to ask if its important to you. They have a nice little pool, and I saw quite a few families enjoying it. The staff, especially the nice lady running the free breakfast, were very pleasant. Not bad if your budget matters.
Room Tip: I think they are all pretty much the same
See more room tips</p><br>Nice small hotel to spend a weekend night<p>Weekend night at Las Vegas is outrageously pricey, more than double or triple the hotel cost compared to weekday night. Here you will find great value for your dollar at weekend night. It is not new, but room is clean. Restroom are nicely newly remodeled. They are very close to Encore and Riviera. Ross and indoor skydriving is just next door. Convention center is also close. Have free wifi, printing, swimming pool. Security after 7 pm. My door is really hard, almost impossible to open while giving me a safer feeling.
Room Tip: I will choose second floor.
See more room tips</p><br>Clean and a good value<p>I stayed here passing through Las Vegas on a return to LA from Zion National Park. I was seeking a clean reasonably priced place to sleep and this hotel fit that need. It was clean but not modern. The continental breakfast is very bare bones. It only includes bagels and butter (no other condiments available), wheat bread slices, three types of cereal, 2% milk, and fruit punch. With that said, the intent of my stay here was not luxury and all was as presented. In addition, the wifi connection was surprisingly stable and fast for what I expected of the property.</p><br>A Struggle To Keep Up..<p>This is an older two story motel which is clean and well kept. However, it is what it is and takes a lot of upkeep to maintain. Continental breakfast from WHICH continent? It is nearly nothing, even fake apple juice. The closed feel due to the walkway vandalism bars is a bit claustrophobic. Vegas has TONS of cheaper hotels, but this one has the ability to park just outside the room. Convention Center Drive is not a busy street. This place is walking distance from the Center, but by the time you walk to the Center, you are too tired to see much inside, large as the place is. Take the monorail from another casino. The Clarion just down the street recently closed; was the old Debby Reynolds and Debby couldn't make it go; I fear the same fate for this place. It is clean and newly painted.
Room Tip: Kids tromped the ceiling one night. Good showers and coolers in room. Quiet. Breakfast is meager.Wit...
See more room tips</p><br>Do not stay here!<p>This property is disgusting! I checked in with my family and I should have known better by looking at the outside of the property and the area it was located in. Next to the property is an open parking lot where bums were hanging out and as I drove around back there was a prostitute walking through the parking lot, not a very secure feeling! After going to the room, which was decent, although the chair was broken and the walls are a gross shade of lavender, they made an effort on the room, but it was still tired, I decided I wasn't about to stay there and put my family through this place. As a hotel manager, I have run some pretty dicey Motel 6 properties in the past, but there was no way I was going to spend one night at this dump! For the price you can stay any place else in Vegas and feel safer and be in a place far less seedy and nasty.</p><br>Value for Money<p>Nice, quiet place away from the strip. A little too isolated and sometimes scary to walk at night and not unusual to find homeless people taking shelter in the neighborhood. Very good staff. Poor wi-fi.
Breakfast is a joke.
Room Tip: Rooms on the east side are a lot more quiet.
