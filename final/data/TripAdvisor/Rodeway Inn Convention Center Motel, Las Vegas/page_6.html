<html><head><h3>Rodeway Inn Convention Center Motel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 6</h3></head><body><br>Good for one night<p>Yes, you do get what you pay for. This is not meant to be a negative review but at $60 a night it is what it is. Overall, the room was clean and the bathroom had been updated. But small things like trim and doors were filthy. The facility is old and has seen many better days and is one of the places I didn't feel comfortable being out in at dark.

The staff that checked me in was pleasant and the continental breakfast was adequate. For a six hour sleep and go the Rodeway Inn was enough.</p><br>Don't do it!<p>We stayed here for St. Patty's day weekend, luckily just 1 night because we had reservations for 2 more nights at the Excalibur. It's just located in a shady area, once we got there we saw a man in a bike just circling the horrible parking lot! He looked shady too! They're parking is scary because its lonely and they even have signs that say they're not responsible for your car if it gets stolen! As soon as we walked into our hotel room we realized we had a queen bed, when we had paid for a king bed. The toilet wasn't working, either! And when we called to ask them if we can get that fixed they said they'd send someone over right away, and right away meant like 1/2 hour! We really were tired driving 6 hrs and to get to a hotel with no working toilet was awful! We told the lady up front about the bed situation and she said all rooms were same price even if its king or queen! They really shouldn't advertise king beds if they're going to give you a queen bed. The lighting was awful, very dark in the hotel, & there weren't enough outlets! It's far from the strip too! It was just as much as what I paid for the Excalibur! I just suggest booking early that way prices aren't high! That's the reason why we chose this place bc it was reasonable priced, I had booked the other 2 nights in December bc I got my boyfriend tickets to muse, so we decided to stay an extra day but by then (in march) the Excalibur was expensive! So just book early and you should be fine! Plus! There was a big trash bag sitting by entrance of our hotel the entire stay!</p><br>Good choice if on a budget<p>We had one only night to be in Vegas. Needed a place that was safe and clean and without bugs. This Rodeway fit the bill. This is an older property, only two stories, and close to the strip. It has been kept up and removated reasonably well. Nothing fancy but everything adequate. The free continental breakfast was virtually worthless unless you are happy with toast and a bagel, and coffee so we went to the nearby Denny's for breakdfast. I usually stay at higher status hotels like Comfort Suites when I travel but this was very acceptable lodging. The price is very competitive. I will stay here again the next time I am in Vegas unless someone else is paying the bill.</p><br>Decent Budget Hotel Good Value<p>On popular weekends most Las Vegas strip hotels sell out or become ridiculously expensive. Since most of my trips to Las Vegas involve spending as little time as possible in my hotel room, I am not inclined to spend too much money for a place to store my luggage and clothes while I am out having fun.

If you fall into the same category then the Rodeway Inn may offer a reasonable option for an affordable place to take a shower and catch a few hours of sleep.

Although the hotel is an older property, the rooms are decent for budget accommodations especially with no “resort fees”, free Wi-Fi and free Continental breakfast (although nothing special). The lobby also has a free computer with a printer that makes it nice to quickly look up local happenings.

The Rodeway is situated in a quiet area of town but with easy access to the strip and convention center. Being an older hotel it does have an “old-school pool” with an eight foot deep end that would be nice for “cannonballs” on a not too hot Las Vegas day.
Room Tip: Choose room near one of the entrance doors. Long distance between entrance doors. First floor would...

I will have to say that my room was far better than I expected. I had a small refrigerator in my room. My only complaint would be about the free continental breakfast. My choice for breakfast was cereal, toast, or a bagle, coffee and juice. They recently quit offering the toaster waffle. After my first morning I never went back to the free breakfast. I will have to say that the staff was super nice and helpful. This hotel is just a block off the strip and is only a 5 minute walk to the Riviera Hotel. Also within a 1/2 block is Walgreens, Denny's, and several shops. I found this hotel to serve my needs and enjoyed staying there. I would go back again!</p><br>Good for the money<p>This is an older property, parking can be tight for large cars, full size vans & pickups. The staff is friendly, the rooms are clean(ours did have a little mold in the caulk in the shower) . Don't worry about noise from the indoor sky dive place next door, hardly noticed it. The bed was good, the room color could be updated, but when I'm in the room it's time to sleep, I can't see the color with my eyes closed. The only complaint I have is no coffee pot in the room. Other than that I would recomend this place.</p><br>Clean refurbished rooms<p>I stayed at the Rodeway on 3 consecutive weekends while traveling in the area. The rooms are clean and have been recently refurbished. Price was $45 per night which is very reasonable for being within a half block of the Strip. The outside looks worn, but the stay had no major problems. The breakfast is cereal, bread, bagels, and waffles. No spreads - jam, peanut butter, or cream cheese. The wifi connection was inconsistent during the stay. The front desk staff were friendly and provided good service. Overall great value.</p><br>Close to the Strip and helpful<p>The motel is located very close to the Strip, the bus to the Strip stops right outside the door.
We have experienced exceptional helpfulness here after our stay.
Our son forgot a backpack in the motel room when we left.
As we noticed that we had been driving for many miles.
We called and the motel staff helped very quickly.
They had found the backpack and sent it by post to one of our next motels.
So we had it before flying back to Germany.</p><br>Las Vegas Cheap<p>If you are looking for a clean, cheap place to stay in Las Vegas, without a casino, the Rodeway Inn is your motel. The place has gotten a bit seedier than when I first stayed there 2 years ago. It's clearly showing its wear. A minimal continental breakfast comes with the room. At about $40 a night, it's a good bargain when the major hotels are not on sale.</p><br>Older Property-- Spacious Rooms<p>Understanding that as a property ages, expectations diminish, I wasn't surprised when I saw the exterior of this motel from the road. While the outside leaves something to be desired, inside is somewhat better. The room was clean and oversized by today's standards. The lavendar walls caught both my wife & I off guard. The edges of the wallpaper border in the bathroom were curling, but there was no mildew in the tub, all caulking was properly tooled, the carpet was clean. There were only two each of the towels and washcloths when we arrived, but staff here is very friendly and eager to please. The continental breakfast was meager with only waffles, bagels, raisin bread, and cold cereal to eat and coffee, apple and orange juice and milk to drink. Despite both indoor and outdoor seating, there were not seats available one morning due to a convention. The bed was comfortable and with the exception of one drunk running down the hall screaming in the middle of the night, all was quiet on the second floor. There was only one working ice machine in the middle of the building as the one behind the office was out of order. Parking was adequate.</p><br></body></html>
