<html><head><h3>Rodeway Inn Convention Center Motel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 12</h3></head><body><br>Rude and Racist<p>The person at the front desk was so rude we actually ended up leaving.</p><br>Clean, friendly, great rate<p>Although this is an older hotel, it is still in good shape. The room was very large and clean. Location is within walking distance from strip, but far enough away that it is quiet. Had a great rate at $39 for a single. I would stay here again.</p><br>Great Stay, Clean and Friendly staff<p>First time at a Rodeway and first time in Vegas.
First of all the hotel staff was great, friendly and very helpful with everything I needed. As for the rooms, they were clean, and had everything you need. As for the location, it was near everything.
I mean the strip was right there, there was a walgreens and a 7 eleven and a Dennys, Im telling you, unless you want to stay RIGHT on the strip and spend alot of money this is a GREAT place to stay. I hope to return.</p><br>This worked out great<p>When we booked this hotel it was called Villa Roma Inn. I read the reviews on Trip Advisor carefully, and we decided this hotel suited our purpose for this trip. We found everything previous reviewers said to be true. The rooms were large, well kept, and the staff very friendly and helpful. Other than a slight communication gap with the housekeeper over when we would prefer our room to be cleaned, we couldn't have asked for more! Normally when we go to Las Vegas, we make our choice based on the pool (i know) and because we went much later this year, we decided it wasn't too important. Although the pool WAS small, it was very nice. We would not hesitate to book this hotel in the future (unless prices skyrocket, now that it is a chain).</p><br>Quiet and Handy to the Convention Center<p>We spent 5 nights at the Rodeway while attending an event at the Las Vegas Convention Center, based on reviews on TripAdvisor when it was still the Best Western Mardi Gras. A good choice! It was an easy walk to the convention center and the Circus Circus end of the strip. Our room was large, with two queen beds, We requested a refrigerator, and also ended up with a microwave oven. There was a radio alarm clock, iron and ironing board, and hairdryer. The bathroom sink area was nice and roomy. The room was a bit dark, but better when all the lights were turned on. Wifi is available in the small reception area.

Security was decent--we had to use our card key to open the door into the long hallway where our room was. Between the building where reception is and the rooms is a small fenced-in pool and outdoor patio. Breakfast was included in the reasonable price and consisted of 3 kinds of cereal, orange and apple juice, packaged pastries, and coffee or tea. A 24-hour Walgreen's was a short walk away where we purchased bananas and other basic groceries to supplement breakfast. Denny's, Peppermill restaurant, and McDonald's were all nearby.

There's no casino or slot machines in the Rodeway, and it was nice and quiet. We would definitely stay there again.

As an added tip, we caught the #108 public bus on the lowest level at the airport; it was only $1.25 for the 20 minute ride to the Convention Center, then we walked to the hotel. If you don't have much luggage, this is quite a bargain!</p><br>Great Cheap Hotel<p>Wow! If you want to stay cheap in Vegas and still have a great place, the Rodeway Inn Convention Center is the place to be! Granted, the place is a bit run down, but the rooms are very clean, big, comfortable and quiet. The bathrooms have also been redone which is nice as well.
The hotel had a free breakfast of danishes and cereal, but it was a good start to get you moving.
Be advised that if you stay here, getting a taxi is next to impossible. The desk will call or you could call yourself, but there was never a time that the taxi showed up. Bummer. You are about a 10 - 15 minute walk to one of two close by monorail stops.
It was so worth staying here and spending our money elsewhere on things that really mattered to us.
I highly recommend if you are wanting to stay cheap!</p><br>Short and sweet stay<p>We were confused as we were looking for Villa Rosa but obviously there had been a take-over; we only wanted a place to clean up and sleep for one night - this was ideal; the continental breakfast was fine and the car parking facilities were a bonus. This place was ideal within our budget leaving extra dollars to spend on other necessities in Las Vegas - unfortunately did not win at the tables</p><br>excellent place even better then Villa roma<p>Awesome experience this rodeway use to be the Villa Roma and now has become a rodeway. no complains nice people and very clean rooms. cant beat the price or the location</p><br>Great Place<p>Huge clean rooms. Great location. Just a 1/2 block off of the strip. Great price. I would definately stay here again.</p><br>Basic, but Nice<p>The hotel on the outside looks run down, but the rooms are fairly clean and newly remodeled. We did notice some sort of residue (not mildew) in the shower the first night, but it wiped up easily and we okay with just rinsing out the showe before using it. The pool is nothing to write home about. It's a fairly nice place to stay on a budget and it's very close to the Strip, the bus stops, and its about 1/4 mile from the monorail stop at the Convention Center. The surrounding area is a mixture between abandoned buildings/parking lot, new construction, and newer hotels. There are also a lot of souvenier shops nearby. McDonald's and Denny's is nearby too. We felt safe walking home from the strip or the monorail station at night to the motel (the street is well lit).

The place was fairly quiet (except for a few occasions where we heard voices in the corridor outside our room), and the staff was friendly. There was an incident of two transients arguing quite loudly in an abandoned parking lot next door one night as we were walking into the hotel. They were yelling at each other and arguing over what we thought to be who claimed the parking lot first (to camp in overnight). We felt a bit uneasy, but everything resolved without incident as far as we know.

One inconvenience was that the wireless Internet didn't work on our laptop from our room. We had to go to the lobby or the pool area in order for it to connect.

Overall, the Villa Roma is certainly no Venetian, but it's clean and comfortable and inexpensive.</p><br></body></html>
