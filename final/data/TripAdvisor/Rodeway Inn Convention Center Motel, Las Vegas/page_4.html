<html><head><h3>Rodeway Inn Convention Center Motel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 4</h3></head><body><br>Ok for 1 night<p>We stayed 2 nights in May in thi motel. The location is quite remote,very far away from the centre. However nearby the motel are good shopping and eating possibilities. The rooms are big and spacious however old- toilet was very noisy and did not flash properly. The pool was very dirty, I saw no one swimming there in 2 days. The worst part was definitely breakfast. Bagel and 3 sorts of cereals. Thats all. Big joke. The price was fair but dont expect a lot. Totally ok for 1 night maximum, however next time I would choose something closer to the centre.</p><br>Good location only<p>We stayed in this motel as we had points to spend on a Route 66 holiday and it worked out a cheap deal ,
The location is good in the middle of uptown and downtown with a bus stop for either just on the main road about a 5 minute stroll . The staff in the motel are very friendly and helpful the rooms are a good size but basic , they have a breakfast but it is not much to write about and a swimming pool which looked a little worse for wear.
The handiest thing is that you can park your car and not have to drive and in Las Vegas that is a sure fire winner. Over all it's not bad for what you pay but the MGM Grande it's not.
Room Tip: Upstairs rooms are quieter

In the case of these ratings, regarding Las Vegas, you will find these very accurate. We disregarded this time for budget. In short, if you don't mind feeling a bit unsafe walking out of your room or returning to it at night, or while in your room, be not alarmed - it's only a big cockroach waiting for you to close the bathroom door so he can look you right in the eye because it was his turn to use the bathroom. Oh yes, it's true.
Pluses were: spacious room, comfy bed, and little fridge in the room. Breakfast not worth it-was only cereal and bagels and bread, mystery juice, coffee, and milk-unless that's your thing, of course.</p><br>Not bad<p>For the price and location, it's not a bad place to lay your head for the night. Unlike some of the other reviews, I did not have any experience with cockroaches. It seems like the housekeeping at these types of motels always seem to miss a handful of hairs in the bathroom (tub, toilet seat, etc). In any event, the room was well-appointed and clean. The bathroom was remodeled with granite counters and the shower was nice and hot. The hallways are very thinly carpeted so when other guests roll their luggage, you can hear it reverberate down the hall and into your room. Free continental breakfast is from 6:30-9:30am and consists of coffee, tea, juice, cereal, milk, raisin bread, bagels and veg spread (no cream cheese, sad face). For the record, I used my Choice points to book it so the room did not cost me anything.</p><br>Convenient Location<p>The outside of the motel made me nervous for my car (although it turned out fine). Our room was clean and recently remodeled. The hallways were VERY rundown. Our room was also quiet. We did not eat the breakfast.
This is a cheap hotel, so you need to manage your expectations.</p><br>Crooks and liers<p>I stayed over night from 12:00 midnight till abou 10:00 am same day last November. the hotel is has a prison feel to it with dirty carpets and lousy breakfast but for the price, I sait you get what you pay for. however my terrible score I give this hotel is for the drama they caused me to get my $100 depost which took 4 calls and more than 3 weeks and their lies on my last call that the reason I was not paid is because I had a pet in the room, which I could not have had coming from overseas on that hour I checked in. So please do yourself a service and avoid this place at any cost.
Room Tip: do't use
See more room tips</p><br>Worst place I have ever stayed.<p>The bathroom was nicely remodeled, however we had to fight the cockroaches for the bed. It is close to the Convention Center, but that is all it has going for it. I am in Las Vegas every year, but will never stay here again. Unless you like cockroaches, I would not suggest staying here either.</p><br>Decent Accommodations - But Offensive Guest ID Policy...<p>I stayed here once before, many months ago, and found the experience satisfactory, so when I needed a basic room at the last minute and wanted to use my Choice Privileges rewards program points to pay for the Saturday night stay, I decided to return here again.

The bottom line is this: While the accommodations themselves were acceptable, the hotel's guest ID policy is not, and for that reason I do not plan to return anytime soon. I'll explain in greater detail below.

Regarding the accommodations:

If judged solely by its curb appeal (or lack thereof), I would never have stayed here. The exterior looks like a fortress, is scarred and worn, and the only word to describe it is creepy. But once inside, the rooms themselves are actually quite decent. Although it did show a few signs of wear and tear, my room, overall, was clean, spacious, reasonably appointed with two queen beds, an ample work desk, a non flat screen TV, and a real closet with sliding doors and an ironing board and iron. The bathroom was up to date and spotless.

The in-wall climate control unit was unplugged from the wall when I arrived, but it worked fine after I plugged it in. The wi-fi internet signal is strong with good response. No password is required to access the wi-fi.

Parking can be a bit tight but I was able to find a satisfactory space.

Now, about the guest ID policy:

This hotel makes physical copies of the guest's personal ID when checking in. Apparently there are no exceptions to the rule - although the last time I was here, many months ago, no such rule appeared to be in place. Having had problems with identity theft on two occasions that was traced to copies of my ID that had been made by hotels (NOT this hotel), and with identity theft being an increasingly common problem, I do not normally allow anyone to make a physical copy of my ID under any circumstances, except when it there are legal reasons that require it.

I have no problem with allowing the desk clerk to check my ID or to even transcribe information from it, but allowing a physical copy to be made opens the door to the potential of all sorts of misuse. In saying that, I am in no way suggesting, saying, or implying that this particular motel or any of its employees did anything wrong, or would do anything wrong. I am simply raising concerns that ugly things could happen even under conditions of reasonable care.

I have to question why any motel might think it needs to do this, particularly when there is no legal or statutory requirement that they do so and what it might mean with respect to the desirability of staying in such an establishment. The vast majority of places I've stayed in Vegas do not make copies of guest IDs, yet this one does. One can't help but ask the question, "Why?"

In any event, it is my personal policy to downgrade my TripAdvisor ratings of properties that enforce such a policy by at least one level. Had the offensive ID policy not existed, I would have rated this property ."Excellent."

It is also my policy not to return to establishments that make physical copies of guest ID's when m to do so.</p><br>Do not stay here<p>I chose this place because I had some reward points to use and the other reviews said it was ok. BIG mistake. We drove around to the back and parked against the building. It looked like a foreign prison. The view was a chain link fence and an excavation site. The building itself; cinder block walls with open windows with iron grill work. There were several metal doors with heavy screen mesh and bars on them. Only some of them could be used to gain access to the interior hallway and when they slammed just it felt like the jailer was shutting you in for the night. The hallway was dingy, dimly lit and dirty. My friend was afraid to go to the lobby unescorted fearing for her life. We walked into the room and it smelled like an ashtray(I had reserved a non smoking room), it had dated furnishings and an old style TV. The bathroom had been remodeled but the walls were painted a gawd awful faded purple. We were there 5 minutes. Only long enough to call the Riviera and get a room there. The only nice thing about this place was the front desk clerk. He was very friendly and didn't give me any problems in getting a refund. I usually don't give reviews if I don't like a place I stay at but this time I made an exception.</p><br>I was surprised!<p>I had passed this establishment before and chose their competition across them instead. This time, I have considered this establishment due to other reviews and want to experience it. I was afraid I will get the musty room and bad experiences that other customers received. Boy, I was surprised! It smelled fresh as soon as I opened the door. It is spacious as other reviewers had mentioned. Clean room and bathroom, and large single bathroom sink. Our room came with hair dryer, iron and ironing board, alarm clock, safe, good working a/c, basic tube TV, and WiFi. The bad parts were property showing its old age but showing some work being done throughout the property, non-working and fee based safe($1.50/stay), didn't come with mini-fridge/microwave, spotty WiFi, and hard to open front door. The good part, pool and Mike the front desk, was kind to check us in early and explained the situation with WiFi. The WiFi at the front office works better. Another thing, if you have a very large vehicle like a full size truck, you can't really park the way the parking line arranged. Your truck tail will be sticking out and other vehicles will not be able to pass by.
Room Tip: Top and back side units are less noisier. The front units are closed to breakfast area and outside...
