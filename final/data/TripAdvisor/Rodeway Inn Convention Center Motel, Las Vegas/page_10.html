<html><head><h3>Rodeway Inn Convention Center Motel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 10</h3></head><body><br>simple accommodation, good quiet location<p>The rooms of this simple accommodation were spacious and had comfortable beds. The bathroom was also quite big and everything was clean. Hotel reception was not extraordinary friedly, but ok. The breakfast was included, however, it was a simple breakfast with cereals, bagels (no toaster, no butter) and with tee/coffee. The location of the Inn is rather convenient, walking distance in a side street to the "Strip".</p><br>Really pleasant suprise<p>WE were looking for a place within walking distance of the convention Center and a inexpensive rate just for the night after attending a trade show, I had enough Choice points to stay here free so I did. I didn't really expect much but it was free! WE were quite pleased to find that it had been renovated not long ago- Paint was clean new bathroom fixtures & new carpet in rooms ...outer hall area is still a a little sketchy But it was close, Clean & got a good nights sleep- All we needed for one night.</p><br>DIAMOND IN THE ROUGH<p>Was EXTREMELY pleased with our recent stay at the Rodeway Inn. Was actually expecting a Motel 6 atmosphere; instead was pleasantly surprised at all this hotel had to offer. Stayed 3 nights; check-in was quick, and efficient. Very clean, nice large lobby; COMPLIMENTARY Computer/ Internet service, USA Today paper, coffee & tea. The COMP. breakfast (6:30 to 9:30am), was Great.........Hot waffles, oatmeal, cereal, donuts, bagels, 2 juices; coffee and tea. Our room was Large, tastefully decorated; had a microwave and refrigerator, desk, 2 chairs; bathroom with granite counter tops, hairdryer; and Cable TV with LOTS of channel selection's. VERY CLEAN accommodations; daily maid service; secure indoor hallways to the rooms. Pool was adequate size, and very clean. I thought the location was good.......walk to Riviera, Wynn properties, Circus Circus, McDonalds, Walgreens, etc.----bus service on the street out front-------the ONLY SMALL negative, the parking is a little tight---- but you can park by / near your room. I would DEFINITELY return to this hotel again !!!!!</p><br>uncomfortably hot room<p>Our flight landed late, so we got to the hotel about 9 pm. The hotel seemed to be surrounded by chain link fence and concrete curb, so it was a bit of a challenge to drive to the room since the parking is one line of cars perpendicular against the building with the driving lane behind them--if there were bigger cars sticking out, it was a bit tricky getting by them.
The room was fine and clean, but the A/C was not on and with outdorr corridors and rooms facing west, the room was hotter than the 106 degree outside. It took 3+ hours to cool off--time we would have rather been sleeping. The continental breakfast had some oranges and pastries in cellophane, plus coffee.</p><br>DON'T LIE TO THE CUSTOMER!!<p>I have stayed here before and although it is kind of a dive, it can be a value for the money. I called to make a reservation for my son and a friend. I explained to the lady at the front desk that I was interested in making a reservation for a 19 year old military boy and she said the "law stated that they cannot rent to anyone under 21" I found out later that the law only states that they have to be 21 if there is a casino. I called back and confronted the lady and she changed her story and told me it was a management decision. It really says a lot for a hotel chain when your clerks lie to the customers! There are lots of other choices out there for the same money so try another option. Kuddos to the Stratosphere hotel for taking the time to assist two young men who were traveling through. They understood the law and did not have to lie to the customer, instead they showed a great deal of integrity by helping them to locate a room for the nigh.</p><br>Hiked Rates For Volcanic Ash Flight Victims<p>Unlike many hotels which lowered rates for Iceland Volcano flight victims this Rodeway hiked its up. (Imperial Palace dropped its rates to $25 a night and gave volcano victims half price meal vouchers) The first 7 nights in a peak convention week at the Rodeway cost me $247.90 with a senior rate - then when I couldn't get out of Vegas the next 8 days cost me $393.60. I was told there were 20 other guests delayed by the volcanic ash problems - some for longer than me - so at least this ill wind blew the Rodeway Inn some good - if not its guests. That said the staff at all levels are superb. The free wifi became a reliable friend and if you have to be stuck in Las Vegas it is a good place to be. Pity this Rodeway Inn sought to profiteer from the volcanic flight victims misfortune.</p><br>Car alarms keep you awake<p>A car alarm went off in front of my room at 3:30 am. I notified the hotel employees and the police. It stayed on until 4:30 am. I couldnt sleep with it on. The owner was not at the hotel and the employess refused to tow it.
Refrigerator in room costs $10 extra, don't know if microwave is available.
The area is ugly. Cold pool and no hot tub. Breakfast consists of cheap pastries, bananas, coffee and OJ. Room is Motel 6 level. Stay elsewhere.</p><br>Well worth the money, great staff<p>Having left Circus-Circus after three horrible nights, we ended up at the Rodeway Inn. Considering this is a small motel just off the strip in Las Vegas, it had Circus-Circus beat hands down. $34 a night compared to $106. Free internet in the lobby or wireless if you have a laptop. Coffee available 24/7 in the lobby. Continental breakfast - not great, but gets you going and was a lot quieter at night.
Staff were brilliant, they put us in for one night, then as we were there for another 5, moved a fridge into our room.</p><br>Nice staff, large clean room, budget price. Excellent option.<p>I stayed one night and would absolutely stay in this hotel again. Very simple but everything I'd want in a budget hotel/motel. Clean and well cared for and not a speck of dirt anywhere. Very nice staff who do a great job of taking care of the place and the customers. There is a very good (new at this time) Thai restaurant, Ping Pong, close by in the shopping square that has a liquor store (across the street from the Walgreen's) so you can take care of all your needs in one fell swoop. I went to the Riviera casino for espresso in the morning. I paid $55 and I'm sure you can get it for a few dollars less if you feel the need to shop around.</p><br>Just Unbelieveble! Incredible! Clean and the rooms are so Nice! And sooo INEXPENSIVE!!!<p>I discovered a inexpensive hotel with services (breakfast, clean, very comfortable beds, internet, smiling and healpfull team, that treat you like family friends!

We are a french family, travelling trough the USA during three months. We are travelling in tents or motels all categories, always looking for a good rate ; quality/price.
We went in very beautifuls hotels...and of course it was expansive, or in very cheap... but they were not clean!

We went to The Rodeway Inn because the Las Vegas Convention Center's Visitor Center told us they had amazing rates and Large Comfortable beautifull rooms with granite bathrooms...

Beauty and comfort of a palace, for a very low price! 3 min WALKING to the center of the strip and the least expensive price per night we have paid for our entire cross country tour!!

We spent one night in the famous Themed Casino...and quickly came right back to this incredible place. For its clean comfortable quiet rooms and FRIENDLY staff.

Because of the money we are saving on the room We are able to treat our entire family ...thats 5 of us to the Chris Angel show...(our son loves magic) Tournement of Champions....our daughter is studying the medevil period in school, and lastly Mystere' for the whole family.

Thank You Rodeway Inn! Because of your kindness service, and outstanding value...you've made Las Vegas a City full of memories my family and I shall never forget!

To give you an idea of just how devoted these people are ...at their front desk is a plaque that reads... "May all who enter as Guests, leave as Friends."

Our entire family feels as though we've been welcomed and embraced...by the staff and that is hard to do....you see in France we own and operate a small 16 room bed ande breakfast.</p><br></body></html>
