<html><head><h3>Rodeway Inn Convention Center Motel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 15</h3></head><body><br>Villa Roma is very acceptable<p>I rated this above average because as regular run of the mill motels go, it is. All the good points are recognized above. Large room, VERY clean, easy access to other strip hotels via Paradise Rd. Outside is as mentioned but who cares. We only use the place for sleeping and pit stops in between puruseing the strip. Wi-fi was not working. I called the desk and no one could help. I saw the network but login kept failing. One other thing, if you have a longer than normal automobile you have to park sideways. If your parking in head in at an angle be sure to pull all the way up. the alley width is marginal. Overall enjoyed the stay and would stay again.</p><br>Not too bad<p>Overall not a bad hotel. My husband won a trip to Vegas and this was the hotel we ended up at. The outside isn't the most appealing, and the parking [----], but the room was clean and nice. there was a very pleasing color on the walls, and the bathroom had a lot of marble. Overall not a bad experience. Would stay here again but for the fact that I will NEVER return to Las Vegas!</p><br>Nice room at very low rates<p>Stayed Sun-Fri for a bridge tournament at the Riviera nearby. Used to stay at the Westward Ho, but with that sadly gone this was a good alternative. Somewhat isolated from Strip by parking lots, the motel had very few guests midweek and was nearly deserted at night, but area seems safe. Parking on the east side was in a tight alley with cars squeezing between a wall and other vehicles, but there was more space on the west side.

Room was clean and good-sized, beds were great, AC worked well, and bathroom had granite surfaces. Lavender wall paint, well, for $29 who cares?

Calling the motel garnered a rate $10 less than the travel sites. Staff friendly and helpful.</p><br>worth it<p>Very close to strip. clean. fair rates. very large room. excellent service. very quiet, almost forgot it was Vegas!</p><br>Villa Roma gets Mixed Review<p>We stayed at the Villa Roma for only one night. The outside of the hotel did not look like the picture on the Internet so we weren't sure we were in the right place initially. The back of the hotel looked much better. The rooms were very clean and the beds were great. Everything has obviously been updated recently but we had problems getting hot water for showers in the late afternoon.</p><br>Good Value<p>I was surprised by how nice the motel is for the money. Upon driving up to the front facade, I was a little leery but once again, the rooms were pleasant and clean. The location is nice...just minutes from the LV Conf Cntr and Stardust and Riviera on the strip.
They advertise high speed access but I didn't get a chance to test it...I was on vacation. There was some noise from slamming doors but I also got that at the Venetian too so idiot drunks are everywhere.
The motel otherwise was surprisingly quiet.
The Villa Roma is converting to the Quality Inn chain and is planning to update their facade and rooms. I'm sure the quality will improve...as will the prices rise.
Right now, this isn't really a family hotel...though I did see families there. The pool is small and isn't set up for kids or diving.
In short, it's a good value with a good location. I always felt safe walking in the area...even at night and felt the room was secure. The staff was friendly and I had no problems with the room</p><br>Great location! Excellent Value! for a budget traveler<p>If you are looking for fancy, glitzy drama, this is not the place. However if you want a clean, comfortable room in a safe location close to the strip/Convention center, this is the place for you.

When you pull up, you may be turned off by the shabby 70s motel look, but don't let that fool you for a second:

Here are the pluses
1. You can walk to the strip
2. You can walk to the Convention Center (save $3-$5 on the monorail each way)
3. FREE wireless internet connection (if it doesn't work or goes down, ask them to have the modem/router/server reset. i.e. Save the $5/hour or $25/day cost in hotels and the Convention Center)
4. It doesn't take an hour to check in/out
5. The room is spacious
6. The beds are very comfortable
7. If you like sushi, there is an excellent new Japanese restaurant "Rock and Roll" sushi a few minutes away (across the street before you get to the Boulevard) - Save the cost of taking a taxi ($10, average) to go to a restaurant)
8. No casino</p><br>Cheap and convenient<p>Just stayed there last week and what I can say is the following:

+Location: Just 300 m from the Strip. If you go there from the airport by coach, ask the driver to drop you at the Stardust as it is the closest one.

+Room: Big, clean and with anything you need within a low budget of course. You enter the room without going through the lobby.

+Price: Quite reasonable balancing everything.

-Casino: It does not have a casino and the closest one is the Stardust.

-Security: For some people, being off the strip is not 100% safe, specially at night.</p><br>Close to LVCC, cheap &amp; cheerful<p>Stayed at the VR during CES 2005. A small tip for Vegas newbies: if the cab driver asks you if you want to go the Interstate route from McCarran, just say, "Not the scenic route, just go up Paradise instead." You'll save half the fare.

First impressions weren't positive: the frontage shouts "Cheap and nasty dive": mock-Hispanic stucco, desperately in need of a lick of paint and a bit of repair.

Reception was small, and without any creature comforts. The staff were friendly and helpful, though.

The room was in the newly-refurbished block behind the pool. It was clean, well-maintained, reasonably spacious, quiet and inexpensive. A nice enough bathroom, if a little dark.

Facilities are relatively basic: no Internet access (but phone port available, if you've an ISP for Vegas -- unlike most overseas visitors of course), but cable TV and in-room aircon, which wasn't too loud. There's no vending machines on site, but shops are just around the corner. For better shops, head away from the Convention Centre (LVCC): there are malls in all directions at the next major intersection.

And it's a short walking distance from the Convention Centre, which is a major win. There's a monorail station at the Convention Centre that will take you into Central LV, but it's a bit further down the road than the LVCC.

Given how cheap the Villa Roma was, I wasn't expecting much, but I was pleasantly surprised. And it's booked up for CES 2006, annoyingly. I'd use it again, but only for conventions. It's not what I'd call a tourist hotel.</p><br>Great place to stay!  Close to strip!<p>I just returned from a week out west and spent a weekend in Las Vegas, staying at the Villa Roma Motel. The hotel room was great! The room was clean and spacious; the bed was very comfortable.

The bathroom was very, very clean. That is very important to me in a hotel room. There was a tub/shower, toilet, one sink, hairdryer, and a bathroom fan.

The room was a very comfortable room to stay in. The rooms have been remodeled recently and were attractively decorated. The linens, bedding, and towels were all clean and in good condition. There was a desk, two desk chairs, a bed, tv, clock radio, and two end tables. The lighting was good. Everything was in good condition. The room smelled fine; no trace at all of smoke in the room.

On the outside, the hotel may not be fancy; that is okay with me, as I am not staying in the lobby or reception area. I felt very safe staying here; safety is important to me. The weekend price was very reasonable and the walk to the strip was about 2 minutes. I think the location is great, especially if you don't have a car.

I have stayed in the large strip hotels and it would take 10-15 minutes by the time I got from my room to various locations within the hotel, the exit, or to my car. Here, I was out my door in seconds and on my way.

There is no casino in the hotel, however, I could be in one in less time than when I stayed at a hotel with a casino. There is a pool--it is not large and fancy, however it was clean. I did not swim in it and never saw anyone in the pool.

There is coffee available, in the lobby, all day for the guests.

There is a Walgreens at the corner and the Peppermill restaurant is close, as well. It is close to the Stardust, Circus Circus, the Riveria, Slots O Fun, and the new Wynn hotel.

I would definitely stay here again!</p><br></body></html>
