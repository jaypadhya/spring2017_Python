<html><head><h3>Rodeway Inn Convention Center Motel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 14</h3></head><body><br>Great position, 'off strip'<p>Why pay Strip prices! 5 mins walk to Riviera/Circus Circus, even less to Dennys, Ross, Wargreens, 7/11 & McDonalds, Wynns /Fashion Show Mall/Treasure Island, ten minutes walk away. The rooms where spotless, and cleaned daily, without fail, including clean towels etc. We had FREE internet access, and cable tv, including HBO Movies & Fox Sports. The reception staff/ & cleaners could not be faulted, and were always very helpful when the need arised. There is free parking, and the pool, although rather small is clean. As for safety, it is on the main road between 'The Strip' and LV Convention Centre, opposite LV Met police building, ie, we had no problems what so ever, even returning in the early hours! The room had air-con, hair dryer, refrigerator, (with freezer compartment), plus iron & ironing board.
To sum up, yes, i will definately return here in the future, and would recommend the Villa Roma to anyone wanting a 'no frills' accomadation, away from the hussle of the strip, which is clean and well maintained.</p><br>Pleasant surprise<p>Though the picture found online is not the front of the building, the room we were given was as comfortable as high class, expensive motels/hotels we have stayed in.

For 45$ (plus taxes), we had a firm kingsize mattress, in a large recently renovated room.

Just a short walk from the strip and restaurants, half price show tickets booth and public transportation.

Would recommend to budget conscious travellers.</p><br>A Little Haven off the Strip :0)<p>Me and my partner stayed at the Villa Roma for 9 nights in October. I honestly can't find anything critical to say about it. The rooms were totally spotless clean and quite large, the staff very friendly and the location was great (2 minute walk to the Strip). I would definately recommend it to anyone looking for a cheap alternative than staying in the hustle and bustle of the Strip and next time I am in Vegas I would definately return.</p><br>Not bad<p>Villa Roma is a shabby looking motel near the Convention Center but inside the rooms are quite large, the bathrooms are new, the king bed I had was pretty good, and there was almost no noise to disturb one's sleep. If you need a place for the weekend and dont want to spend $300 for a room at (say) The Mirage, this is an economical choice.</p><br>Good value<p>Not a luxury option but great value compared to other Vegas hotels, especially at weekends.

Plus points: large room, very clean, pretty quiet, huge new marble bathroom, nice staff, coffee available 24 hours a day in lobby, close to strip (Riviera) and monorail.

Negative points: our room phone was out of order, wireless internet was weak in room, not a very appealing area at night with lots of empty, dark parking lots and some slightly strange characters hanging around.</p><br>Good Deal for the Price!<p>The Villa Roma delivered as advertised! My wife and I stayed 4 nights from Monday September 24th thru Thursday September 27th. Our room with two queen beds was very large, clean and remodeled including a new granite bathroom. I feel the staff could supply more towels to the rooms although they are accomodating when asked for more. The furniture, although sparse included a desk and was also new. The staff was very friendly and accomodating. Check-in took about 2 minutes and check-out took even less time. Try that at one of the casino hotels!

Downside is the outside appearance, but I was told this place has been purchased by a hotel chain and they are renovating. Also the long narrow hallways still need some sprucing up, but hey, its a walkway. The lobby is very modest but clean with friendly front desk service around the clock. The lobby also has a computer available for guests and free coffee.

The Villa Roma is located on Convention Center Blvd, just north of the main strip mega hotels and is a leisurely 10-15 minute walk to the Fashion Mall on the strip and about a 10 minute walk to the Convention Center monorail station on Paradise Road. There is a Walgreens on the way to the strip and a Denny's Restaurant is a block or two away and visible in the other direction so it is easy to find. In my opinion, Convention Center Boulevard itself is an up and coming area. There are a couple of very hotel nice properties on the road, one at which I stayed on business a couple of years ago. My wife and I had no problem feeling secure walking during the day and at night although at night I would not like to see my wife walking alone.

It is easy to do the strip from this location. The strip bus (The Deuce) has a stop just a couple of blocks away and is an inexpensive alternative to the monorail. For the price, this place is a bargain! All we did was rest in the room. The room was clean and comfortable. Why pay hundreds more for a place to sleep? The money we saved paid for a terriffic show and a trip to the Grand Canyon!</p><br>A great inexpensive option just off the strip<p>I was in Las Vegas for a conference at the Riviera, but wasn't able to book a room there before they sold out. So, I did some searching for nearby alternatives and found the Villa Roma. I was a little wary, but the reviews here gave me some encouragement and I have to say I was quite pleased with my experience. I arrived around 11:30 PM and checked in quickly and easily. My room was much larger than I would have expected for such an inexpensive motel. There was a mini-fridge in the room. In addition to wireless internet, there was an ethernet port in the room, which I ended up using instead. The room was clean and the bed was well-made. The air conditioner kept up nicely with the stifling Las Vegas heat. The bathroom was nice as well -- extremely clean with a spacious countertop. The room was serviced daily with fresh toiletries and sheets, without having to request it.

I was able to spend some time in a friend's "deluxe room" at the Riviera, and I didn't think it was quite as nice as my cheaper room at the Villa Roma! It was only a 2-minute walk to the strip. The walk can be a little sketchy late at night, but I had no problems. If you want to catch a cab without having to call for one, just walk over to the taxi stand at the Riviera. In short, if you don't require a casino downstairs from your hotel room, the Villa Roma is a great option to base your stay in Las Vegas.

(One bit of advice if you do take a cab to/from the airport. Tell the driver you want to go via Paradise Rd. Don't let him take you on the interstate, as the extra distance will easily add $10 to your fare.)</p><br>A Great Find!!<p>What a great find!!

I went to Vegas on a trip with my brother - he is 23 and I am 26. We were looking for an inexpensive, clean hotel that was close to the strip as we didn't have a car. WOW!! This is exactly what we found.

The Villa Roma is on Convention Center Drive just off the strip. The walk to the strip couldn't have been more than 3 minutes. It was safe and well lit.

The rooms were great!! Cleaned everyday, spacious, an air conditioner that worked, free local calls and a friendly hotel staff. The bathrooms were very clean and had been recently renovated. Our room also had a mini fridge. (When I booked I was told that I could only request a fridge and if one was available when I checked in then I could get it. I was however told that they did not expect to have a room available for me with a fridge because all those rooms had been occupied already. To my pleasant surprise when we got to our room we DID have a fridge!! Good on you Villa Roma.)

At the corner of Convention Center Drive and the Strip there is a big Walgreen's where you can buy anything you need...like bottled water. There is also a liqueur store right there so you can stock up.

The outside of the building isn't pretty..but don't let that throw you.

There is a small outdoor pool.

It was quite went we wanted to get to sleep and there is free coffee in the lobby!!

We are booking a trip to Vegas again and will likely chose this place to stay!!

It is a SHORT walk to Slots-O-Fun and Circus Circus and the Riviera.

If you are looking for fancy this is not the place. But if you are looking for a CLEAN, SAFE, QUITE place to lay your head at night this place is for you. (Book in advance and get even better rates!! We booked a month and a half in advance and averaged $50/night from Wednesday - Sunday!!!</p><br>A very good Las Vegas option<p>We only stayed in the Villa Roma because we arrived in Las Vegas a night earlier than originally planned. We were pleasantly surprised. The motel is well situated, only a 5-10 minute walk from the Venetian, Mirage and Fashion Plaza Mall. In our previous stay in Las Vegas, we had stayed in the Stratosphere, and the Villa Roma is better situated and was charging half the price of the Start. The rooms were a good size, and had the same amenities as other LV hotel rooms. The staff were very helpful. Overall, this was a very pleasant stay, and probably less stressful than the huge queues and crowds found at the bigger hotels.</p><br>very bad<p>Room very dirty, take advantage of high volumen of travelers to rip them off. NOT WORTH $150 DOLLARS AT NIGHT!!! not even $50 dollars. Take time to planned your trip and do not believe in the hotel description is more a one star than 2 stars.</p><br></body></html>
