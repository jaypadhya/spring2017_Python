<html><head><h3>Rodeway Inn Convention Center Motel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 8</h3></head><body><br>Very average<p>Not bad but not exceptional good either. I would rate it with 2.5 strars maximum but not half's at tripadvisor. From a designer's point of view the property looks like a box or prison but my major problem is its location. It is next to Riviera and across Circus Circus. Unfortunately, that part of the strip is not the best. Walking to NY NY or MGM may take a hour. It is a nice walk, but if you have to do that many times its getting annoying. Taking the monorail can be an option. It costs $5 (one way) but walking to the convention center station is not so convenient either. Breakfast was disgusting. Only coffee, juice and some (very) bad tasting donuts available. Plus the breakfast area looks very unattractive, too. Another problem was the wifi. I couldn't connect with my laptop. This happens very rare to me. Parking is free. On the good side the rooms are big and clean. I had a fridge in my room, too.
In conclusion, this hotel offers cheap and clean rooms but its location is not ideal. Especially if you plan to spent time at the MGM, NY NY or even Bellagio forget it...</p><br>Diamond<p>I was a little skeptical when I booked this hotel for the weekend. Hotels were a little pricey for this weekend. I did not know that Mayweather and Ortiz were fighting. But We had tickets to a Tears for Fears concert so we had to go. I got Friday night for $44 and Saturday night for $54. I also had no idea where this hotel would be, Be when we arrived the check in lady was very helpful and when I explained that we had driven 10 hours she found us a room to get right in to. We were in the back building which I was happy to find had an outter corridor so you needed a key to get in and the room doors were not right in the parking lot. We opened the room door and found a clean room in an updated condition. The room was very large and could easily fit an extra bed or for a longer stay with children would have been ideal. The bathroom had granite tile floor and counters and the shower was great with high pressure. There was a safe in the room but no fridge. The pool was small but was clean and still had water middle of september. Breakfast was the only let down, it ran from 630 - 930 but was picked clean by 830 most mornings. But thats not a big deal. While checking in the people in front were also checking in and there rate was two times mine so I was very happy. They do have free internet in the rooms but I could not get my laptop, ipod or ipad to ever hook up so I gave up. Whose there for the internet anyway, The hotel is located just off the stip (like 200 yards). You can walk to the to the Wynn and Encore in just a few minutes and the Fashion mall. The Riviera is right next door and walk across an empty parking lot and your at four or more resturants. Free parking is also a plus</p><br>A dream come true<p>I couldnt find a better way to title this review. Its just that , a dream come true. I live in Las Vegas for 2 years now, and for my work i have to stay close to the strip from time to time , and after trying a lot of the big Hotels ( Bellagio , Venettian , etc ) i tryied this.
Not only i saved a lot of money , but i was very happy with my dicision.
Let me go step by step , why you should go to this place in your next visiti to Sin City.
First , The price , you can get a room for a week for 150 usd . Yes u red right. 150 a week , i was in shock , i payed 120 the night before at the bellagio only for 1 night.
Second, Location. You are 1 street away from the strip, near all buses , and walking distance from any point of the strip .
3- Clean and big rooms , this for my is very important, and i couldnt be more happy with my room. Big one , 2 beds, tv , little fridge, radio , all the things you need in a room.
4- Nice pool , not super big , but clean and refreshing.
5- Nice staff and service, anything you need , they try to help you.

Friends, this is not the bellagio or the venettian , but for that price ,you get more than u pay for....This is the perfect place for guys that dont want to spend a lot of money in a room , and still want a decent place , clean and friendly.</p><br>Worth the money and the stay<p>I was hesitant to book here because of the price $39.00, but was pleasantly surprised by the very clean lobby and friendly customer service. The room was spacious, comfortable and clean. The pool was clean and refreshing. The only questionable thing was the "continental breakfast" in the morning. I would stay here again.
Room Tip: Worth it for the price

1. Location: Wonderfully situated between The Strip and Paradise Blvd just minutes from the Las Vegas Convention Center. Near all buses (Express, Deuce, and regular city buses). Walking distance to restaurants, shops, and shows.

2. Rooms: Very clean, large, and wonderfully appointed. What I really like is that the rooms have outside entrances - but also with a locked access corridor. So, you get the convenience of outside access and the security of inside access. It is a very unique and fabulous configuration.

3. Staff: Very friendly, helpful, and courteous. They make you feel like this is your home.

4. Hotel amenities: Great swimming pool and continental breakfast. Terrific cable television. In addition, there is a microwave and computer in lobby.

5. Price: This hotel is part of the Choice Hotels chain, so great special rates are available.

We have been travelling to Las Vegas for over 20 years and are so glad to have found this wonderful hotel. It is a very hassle-free place to stay. We hope it becomes your "home away from home" the way it has become for us.</p><br>short stay<p>looks old on the out side odd colors in the room but very clean nice bed qiet and secure we stayed one night on the way to sandeago waiking dist to the strip exelant price would deffenently stay there again</p><br>fantastic!!<p>The staff are really helpful and friendly. Great service! And the hotel price is a good value, with free breakfast (its a very simple bf with donuts, but its better than nth), wireless, spacious rooms and printing service.. Location is good too. just a 2-3 mins walk away from e las vegas strip.</p><br>Good Hotel off the strip<p>Not a flashy hotel on the strip, but great value for what it is. Plenty of free parking. No resort fees. Rooms near the lobby noisy and the front office very helpful and friendly. The housekeeping staff however have no consideration for the guests and are loud and noisy in the early hours. This needs to be addressed, but other than that a very nice great value hotel.</p><br>Great value for the price<p>Good place to stay if you are attending a convention at the Las Vegas Convention Center, which is an easy five (maybe ten if you walk slowly) minute walk down the street. You can avoid the long lines for taxis at the Convention Center, or if you have a car, avoid reparking your car, instead stay here and park your car at the hotel. The Convention Center parking lot now extends all the way to teh Somerrset, which is to say, almost as far as the Rodeway. This used to be the old Villa Roma Hotel. Rooms are surprisingly good, if you used to stay at the old Somerset House Hotel, just down the street, this is a good alternative with the addition that they serve a complimentary breakfast here. No slot machines in the lobby...this is a quiet place, and convenient to Las Vegas Blvd. There are no restaurants adjacent, although there is a Denny's around the corner on Las Vegas and the Peppermill Restaurant (somewhat nicer than Denny's). However, if you re here for a convention, you are probably attending a lot of meal functions, receptions and dinners anyway, so this may not be important. This is a place for the non-convention visitor who wants a quiet place that is close to, but not in the middle of, all the activity in Las Vegas, or who wants to not have to walk through enormous parking garages and take elevators to get to their car. Rooms have a small refrigerator to help keep your beverages cold.</p><br>Great Value<p>Spacious room, free WiFi, free phone calls, good fridge, small but pleasant pool area - free breakfast and often, depending on conventions, great value.</p><br></body></html>
