<html><head><h3>Rodeway Inn Convention Center Motel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 16</h3></head><body><br>Good for the price<p>I stayed here due to the price and proximity to the Convention Center. Other reviews said that it was within walking distance to the CC. It IS, but... not in the middle of summer. And also not a good place to walk at nighttime if you're a single woman. It was a bit far, so ended up driving to the Hilton every day and valet parking my car ($5 per day). Not bad, when the prices for this motel were less than half what the Hilton charges.

I stayed my first two nights at the Hilton (due to convention requirements), and then moved to the Villa Roma. It is rundown on the outside, but the inside was actually quite nice. Newly renovated rooms with a nice color scheme. Great furniture and the bed was really quite comfortable.

My only issue was the smell. They apparently are using a very potent room freshener. It actually made me sick. So - I asked for a new room that hadn't been cleaned yet, and requested the room not be sprayed after cleaning. No problem, and there was no problem the rest of my stay. The management was very friendly and accomodating.

It was a great proximity to the new Metro Rail system - I could catch it at the Hilton or the CC stop. That is a great feature for business travelers - makes it easy to get everywhere quickly. I simply drove from the VR to the CC stop on the rail line and parked at a nearby hotel parking lot (for free!) and cruised the strip from there.

All in all, a quiet place to stay for mid-week business travel - Cheap and accommodating. A very nice stay.</p><br>great room for business travelers not tourists<p>before booking any room, you need to ask yourself "what am I looking for in a hotel" this greatly effects star ratings ..

In my case I was attending a week long event at Las Vegas convention center... and needed a nice clean room within walking distance of the convention center.. with hot showers that wouldn't bankrupt me. Villa Roma fits this very well (7nights at this motel is equal to 1 maybe 2 nights pricewise as Venetian, Wynn etc) The rooms are all newly remodeled.. the outside of the motel does look like something out of a 1950's SCI-FI movie runned down outside, inside lobby old signs, old cash register booking area etc. really dated but management said they are joining Comfort Inn chain and the outside is due for a complete makeover on the one hand, it makes the hotel more apealing.. this does lead to potential of higher prices.. which is probably what the owners want

tourist review
if your flying into vegas as a tourist, I actually wouldn't recommend the motel.. the pool area is too small for kids, family and everyone to "hang out" they would need to really renovate this & include a SPA etc and no room service etc. perhaps if all you wanted to do was go to the big resorts and gamble..</p><br>Excellent Room, Close to Strip<p>This motel was recommended to us by a friend. I am very picky when it comes to motel/hotel rooms. My first choice was a big Hotel/Casino on the strip, however my husband convinced me to try this motel. We are frequent visitors to Vegas.
The room was newly remodeled, painted in pleasing colors, and the bathroom is decorated beautifully with a huge mirror and even had an exhaust fan, which some of the bigger hotels on the strip don't have installed. The double wide closet doors are full length mirrors, which I loved having.
It is a quick walk to a Denny's, The Riveria, The Stardust, the Peppermill and the new Wynn Casino. There is a construction site next door, but that didn't detract from the view we had of the strip.
The stairs are narrow and there isn't an elevator if you are staying on the second floor, however, I was pleased with our room and would definitely stay here again.
The staff is also very friendly and accomodating.</p><br>pleasantly suprised<p>I go on business trips to las vegas from time to time and I was looking for bargains. I ordered a room from this hotel but I wasn't expecting much because of the price I got. When I got here, I got a room that was renovated. I was pleasantly suprised. There were no smoke or smells and it was relatively clean. Although there was no high speed internet or gambling, I just wanted a nice place to stay. No bellagio, but good for the price.</p><br>Prison Cell<p>I visit Vegas monthly for business and I usually check out prices on my favorite travel site and always had good luck until I decided to stay at the Villa Roma. It's kind of like a Motel 6 encased in a barrier with prison bars to keep the danger out. The first room I went it had a leaky toilet so I asked for another. I settled for the second room. It was depressing. Although it was suppose to be non smoking, it reeked of smoke and alcohol. There was a hole in the wall in the bathroom. It looked dark and dingy. At 3 in the morning there was the clanging of the steel door as people ran on the walkway at the second level. This is only my personal observations. Maybe yours will be different.</p><br>Goed budget hotel<p>Rodeway Inn Convention Center is een budget hotel; de ligging is gunstig vlakbij the Strip. De kwaliteit is redelijk en de prijs-kwaliteit verhouding goed. Het personeel is vriendelijk en vlak voor de deur is een bushalte - voorzieningen zijn oké.</p><br>Muy correcto si vas al Vegas Convention <p>Ночевали с субботы на воскресение, когда ценник на большие отели негуманен. Расположение удобное, большой чистый номер, есть бассейн, с утра можно немного перекусить булочкой с с филадельфией. Чемоданы можно оставить на ресепшене бесплатно на целые сутки. Кстати, на тюрьму совсем не похож, разве что, на какую-нибудь норвежскую :) Напротив отеля остановка, ездили до аутлетов и до следующего отеля, стоимость билета 8$ в сутки.</p><br>Ottimo prezzo ideale per una notte di passaggio a Las Vegas<p>Muy correcto en relación calidad precio . Puedes ir caminando al centro de convenciones y al stripe a 20 min o menos del Encore
Desayuno de 6:30 A 9:30 bastante básico pero correcto , a 200 mts de un dinner
Piscina muy correcta y personal muy amable
No recomendable para familias o viajes de ocio , para trabajar de 10</p><br>Ancien<p>Di passaggio a Las Vegas per una sola notte, senza altro obiettivo di dormire e ripartire. Questo residence a dieci minuti a piedi dalla Strip si è rivelato una buona scelta. Posto auto sotto la camera e c'è pure una piscina all'aperto. Wi-Fi disponibile, colazione accettabile.</p><br></body></html>
