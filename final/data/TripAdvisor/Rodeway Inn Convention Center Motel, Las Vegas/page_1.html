<html><head><h3>Rodeway Inn Convention Center Motel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 1</h3></head><body><br>Very good location and very affordable price<p>I stayed at this inn for 2 nights during my first trip to Las Vegas 2 weeks ago. The location of this inn is excellent just off the main Las Vegas Strip behind The Encore Hotel. There's a bus stop just in front of the Inn and the bus service Duece and SDX goes to the strip and Fremont Casino area and the South Premium Outlet Mall. Or you can walk to the Strip more or less in 10 minutes. They provide simple breakfast of bread and cream cheese spread, coffee is available all day at the reception area. Free good wifi , clean room with cable TV, safe and quiet, the staffs are very friendly and helpful. The room rates varies in weekdays and weekends or holidays. I paid USD110 for 2 nights. Yup I would definitely recommend this Inn for its great location and convenient.</p><br>Good overnight <p>Well placed simple accommodation just off the strip.Very helpful desk staff. Corridors a bit scruffy but room was clean and comfortable. Various eateries and food stores nearby. Useful overnight stop before return flight.</p><br>2 stars because of the nice employees<p>I did not stay because the place seemed sketchy and dirty and unsafe. Random ppl walking around the parking and vacant lot next door. They seemed to be watching what you were doing too much. When I was told because I have a dog I had to take the avail room at back of the hotel, nothing towards the front I cx my reservation and left. The front desk person was nice and very understanding. If not for him this review would be 1 star.</p><br>No ritz or glitz, but....<p>This is an old school motel which has been kept up with new paint & not a major overhaul. The place, including the pool & area are clean. The bed is comfortable & the shower is good with plenty of warm water. The staff is VERY friendly & helpful. It's about a 10min slow walk to the convention center. The strip is a straight shot 5min slow walk & brings you right to a Walgreens, 7-11, Denny's & other stores. Slots of Fun & Circus Circus are just a little further. There is also a bus stop pretty much right out front of the hotel. They have a free small breakfast, coffee & water(cooler). I'm a solo traveler & had no problems with the area</p><br>Not too bad, pretty clean, near the strip, inexpensive<p>Looking for a cheap hotel to stay one night near the strip. Front desk help was good.
Room was pretty clean. Bathroom was fine. Bed was comfortable.
Heard the people above walking, but not much noise. Heard people walking and talking near the door, but not much of it.
Breakfast was meager; cereal, toast, bagels, coffee.
Area seemed safe enough.</p><br>nice room, very clean ,<p>the workers were lovely and the free breakfast and coffee was decent.the hotel room was very clean and the bed were comfortable. the shower gave out nice hot water which i like. the location was a bit scary-the outside looked very drab, but once inside the hotel it was decent for the price. it is great for a one night stay. i would come back again</p><br>Better than expected.<p>I was a little nervous when we pulled up. It was really dark. The outside is a little run down. Although, it looks like they have recently painted. You have to use your key to get into the hall, which was nice added security. The man at the front desk was very friendly and helpful. The room was nice looking and clean. The bed was comfortable. It is really close to the strip, but yet away from the craziness. You can walk to the strip. Our kids enjoyed the pool. Although, the bottom was dirty. The breakfast is really basic: bagels, cereal, toast, muffins. But, my kids were happy and we didn't have to go get breakfast, which was nice.</p><br>The Nevada State Penitentiary is more comfortable than this dump<p>Run, run, run, far away from this pit! After being assigned a room that smelled like an impossibly sour combination of vomit, diarrhea and a jug of milk left out in the desert sun for more than a month, my buddy returned to the manager/owner to get a different room. To call this man surly would be an egregious overstatement. My friend had to all but arm wrestle this bitter old man to get a new room. New room secured, it had no vile odors, but it was as outdated as they come -- with tacky floral bedspreads, a dinosaur TV and purple paint on the bathroom walls. Yuck. The whole building resembles an ancient prison. The "continental breakfast" was stingy and unappetizing. They can't implode this dump soon enough. Yuck!
Room Tip: Avoid at all costs
See more room tips</p><br>Great room.<p>Not our diet for breakfast, but clean, nice staff and good price. With just my phone free WiFi was good. Great for business travel. 113 degrees and the room was very comfortable. Parking is designed for medium sized vehickes.</p><br>Great Discount One Night Stay<p>I know this is a bare bones place for basic necessitites but I liked it. The breakfast isn't really a breakfast.. Mostly bread and cereal. The pool isn't one you would write home about... but it served us well as a quick night sleep on the way to the next stop. People were friendly. For the cost I give it a thumbs up when you just need a comfortable bed and shower.</p><br></body></html>
