More </p><br>Don't Judge A Book By Its Cover ... Surprisingly Nice...<p>From the outside, upon approaching the motel, I almost wondered what I was getting myself into. But as the old saying goes, don't judge a book by its cover, and the same also applies to this motel. The building looks almost like it belongs behind barbed wire, with guard towers, searchlights, and all of the other features of a small...
More </p><br>Basic, but clean. Good location.<p>I don't want to spend 30 or 45 minutes or even more waiting in line to check-in at the budget casino options along the Strip, so I decided to give this property a try. From the outside it appears slightly scary, I joked it resembles a prison. But looks can be deceiving ... Check-in was super fast and was assigned...

More </p><br>Affordable and 1 block off strip<p>They have a large pool - with a lock entry, very large quiet rooms, fridge and the room doors are inside a locked access hall, that keeps non-guest away. This is our hotel of choice when in Vegas, the staff is friendly and they have a free continental breakfast. within a few blocks of Circus Circus and Encore, behind 7-11...
More </p><br>Clean &amp; close to the convention center<p>I was in Vegas for a convention so the Rodeway Inn was very convenient -- just a 5-10 minute walk away. It's clean and the front desk staff was accommodating, but not everything works as it should. I was sent to a room that hadn't been cleaned yet. The plug in the bathtub didn't work so I couldn't take a...
