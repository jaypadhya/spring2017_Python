<html><head><h3>Rodeway Inn Convention Center Motel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 7</h3></head><body><br>very little sleep &amp; noisy motel not a holiday motel<p>I stayed here end of April 2012. Staff seem nice enough but you wont sleep much here even if you want to. Its the worst place I stayed at in North America. Rooms are run down but ok, but its cheap... and theres a reason! its near Circus Circus and the strip thats it for the good points. It seems to cater a lot to long time guests / workers rather than travellers/ holidaymakers.
There's such a choice in Las Vegas, so either stay at a proper place on the strip or stay in the downtown and save some money. Somewhere like El Cortez Hotel and Casino which was a fraction of the price for a better hotel and sleep than I experienced here. Youve been warned!</p><br>Great hotel, although quite a walk from the action.<p>This hotel is super clean. The although whoever decided on the decor needs an eye exam. The place looks rather seedy, but the interior is very clean and decent. The hot water seemed to be a problem though. Would definitely stay again.
Room Tip: Maybe ask for something closer to a water heater.

The room was very large and had a nice ac unit. The bathrooms have been updated and are pretty nice and well stocked. The issue was had was the bed. You could actually lay in bed and count the springs. It would pop and bang as you roll over or get in and out of the bed. It was quite uncomfortable and should be replaced. Other than that, the room was fine.
Room Tip: There are outside gates that allow you access to the hallways. Not all gates have key access and yo...

Parking a premium, ask for a room near the back.</p><br>It is less crowded.<p>For the same price I could have stayed at many of the casinos choose here to use my free night from other stays and the continental breakfast. However as I sit having cereal and chewy donuts And over hear other s complaining the breakfast is the worst they have ever had I have to wonder why could I Not have thought mcdonalds 1 menu.</p><br>Great value within walking distance of the convention center<p>The room had been completely redone, with a granite counter top and new tile in the bathroom. It was in good repair, and there was plenty of hot water. The closet was twice of size of those at most hotels, and there were plenty of hangers. An iron and ironing board were in the closet, and a hair dryer was in the bathroom. It has been years since I stayed in a hotel room with so much space. Even with a king-sized bed, there was still plenty of room. Others used it for equipment and supplies for their booth at the convention center. My room, number 259, did not have a refrigerator. Ask for one if you need it, because I understand that they are available.

The rooms in the building where I stayed had an extra layer of security because I had to use my room card to get into the building itself. Parking was at an angle, and the spaces were wide enough so I did not have to worry about someone denting or scratching my car with their car door. Sometimes I would hear a door slam, but a wind tunnel next door made "white noise" which seemed to drown out most other noise so my room was relatively quiet. The wind tunnel noise itself was not disturbing.

The best part about breakfast was the waffles, which were just right - not too crispy, and not too gummy. The waffle maker makes two waffles at a time, which reduced waiting. There were separate trays for sweet foods like donuts, and savory offerings like bagels. When I was there, only syrup and margarine were available for the waffles. I did not see jam, cream cheese or fruit, although there was apple and orange juice.

The computer in the lobby offered free Internet access, which made it convenient to print a boarding pass. A sign said the first ten copies were free and after that they wanted a dollar a page. Some companies in town for the convention held team meetings in a conference room at the Inn. I was pleased that there is no casino at the Roadway Inn, and there was no smoking in the lobby and the breakfast area. The staff was friendly.

It was an close walk to the convention center. Walking back at the end of each day was unpleasant because I could not avoid more than a dozen solicitors who were distributing advertising materials featuring photographs of women who were dressed (or not) to attract clients. I refused to take the flyers, but they littered the sidewalk. Your husband will not be able to avoid seeing them. If you want to accompany him on his trip, and bring the kids too, the Rodeway Inn rooms are large enough to accommodate a family. There is room for portable cribs, stacks of diapers and plenty of toys. You can walk to attractions and shopping. I wish Las Vegas would lower the fees on rental cars, and raise the fees on solicitors. They could use the money to clean the sidewalks each night. Rodeway Inn property and the sidewalks nearby were free from litter. Everybody on the property appeared to be guests or staff. The flyers in the lobby were family friendly by Las Vegas standards. While I was there, the handbill distributors were concentrated by the convention center, so those walking from the Rodeway Inn to the Ross store next door or to the strip may not have to run a similar gauntlet.

I already made my reservations to stay there during the convention next January. I can cancel up to 48 hours ahead without a penalty. Maybe I'll see you there.
Room Tip: All the parking is by the back building, so that is where you should stay if you want your room to b...

Although the staff was friendly there was an issue with the "free wifi" every time we tried to use it. Apparently they had to continually "reset it" which meant we had to continually head to the front desk, only to return to our room with no wifi. We had asked beforehand for a guarantee that there would be wifi and we were told "absolutely"

Next issue - COCKROACHES, found two, one got stepped on when our colleague was walking through his room. what a nice surprise. Check the pic against the carpet in the other pic, this is REAL.
Don't stay here.
Room Tip: If you don't like cockroaches, stay somewhere else.
See more room tips</p><br>Clean, big room great location for the price<p>me and my husband went to Vegas for 7 nights and just wanted somewhere to crash that was clean - i was a little skeptical due to reviews - but i have to say we had a decent stay. the front desk people were nice - room was big - we stayed on the second floor in a king room - had a fridge and a large closet. it's about a 5 min walk to Denny's/Walgreens/bus stop/ the Riviera.
we weren't in it long enough to be able to complain much - there is a loud generator next door, and you can hear the planes but it was a good place. the breakfast reviews on here were pretty accurate - donuts/danishs' - coffee/tea/apple and orange juice and you can make your own waffles just make sure you get there early.
all in all you get what you pay for - we payed about 40$/night which we didn't think was bad :) would stay here again!</p><br>family vacation for budget people<p>clean , but old motel. On the strip. with breakfast ( tea, coffee, juices, donuts, donuts, donuts, wafles). close to circus circus if you need advanture for kid. close to rent a care ( 5 min walk), close to casino, has internet access in the lobby with free computer, excellent info. Definitly will come back. we were 2 kids 2 adults both are happy. Hard pillows, but i just slept without it, and kids did not complained</p><br>Third world motel<p>this was terrible room dirty run down toilet seat paint was wore off smelled like a dirty aquarium bread crums or something on the sheets,hard to find small one way path to drive through, clerk argued that I didn't pre pay booked on line Continental breakfast was a joke shows fruit in pictures NONE stale donuts RAN OUT coffee RAN OUT, had cold cereal , had orange juice, and tiny waffle machine in a small room standing room only for nothing because even if you would have wanted a waffle it would have been faster to drive across town in rush hour traffic to the ihop or something. BEST WAY TO DESCRIBE IS MAYBE THE RENT THESE BY THE HOUR BECAUSE IT WAS ONE OF THOSE KIND OF PLACES the only other thing I might add is on some of the other reviews might be ok if your drunk or on drugs
