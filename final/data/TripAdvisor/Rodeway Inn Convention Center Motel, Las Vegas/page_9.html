<html><head><h3>Rodeway Inn Convention Center Motel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 9</h3></head><body><br>It's a great location...close to bus stops and "the strip"<p>I was concerned that the room may not be too nice because of the price of the room but was pleasantly surprised. It is located 1/2 block from the strip and several good restaurants. The Encore and Wynn are nearby as well as the north and south bus stops. We had a great time and would stay here again.</p><br>OK, but forget about breakfast.<p>I mostly stayed at this hotel for the Choice Privileges points and wasn't expecting anything special so I wasn't disappointed. The hotel was conveniently located and not overpriced. Mostly clean although the wallpaper in the shower area was peeling a bit. They did have to move me to another room because the first one didn't have hot water, but they did that as soon as I asked. Mostly I was surprised at their pathetic excuse for breakfast. I was there for 4 days and checked on breakfast several times each morning. Usually there was nothing at all put out there to eat except some weird red bunt cake thing that nobody touched for the days it was there. The only food available at all was about enough waffle batter for half a serving on one of the days. I think this hotel would be better off just being honest and not pretending to have breakfast at all.

Other than the breakfast thing I have no real complaints. I'll probably even stay there again for the exact same reason I did this time. Points and location are sufficient, just don't expect too much.</p><br>Kind of Dated<p>Needed a place to crash after a very late arrival. We had a king bed room. It looked like something out of the 60s. Walls were a bright lavender, yes lavender! Maybe it was the Liberace Memorial Suite. Other than the strange decoration, the room was clean and the bed was comfortable. I looked in on the continental breakfast room the next morning -- did not go in -- and it didn't look like it amounted to much.</p><br>I was scammed<p>I feel scammed by this hotel and this site. I did my research and was impressed by the reviews others wrote. I got that it would be cheap but clean and safe. Unfortunately it's neither. I wont walk on the floor without shoes, the door to the room has been beat in before. They charge for the room safe and its not even bolted down, its attached to the bookshelf. This hotel is so bad that the other hotels around it have blocked it off.</p><br>Right off the strip, showers are great!<p>Don't be fooled be this small hotel, a block from the strip. It was a very pleasant place to stay. When we arrived, we were a little spooked by the fact that they did not seem very busy. The check in and out was prompt, and the service was great. The room was right near the door, and no stairs or elevator to deal with. The room's appearance was average for a budget hotel, but the shower, that was amazing! Toasty warm, with lots of water pressure to relax a sore back after walking the strip all day. The only down side was the fact that they did not have the continental breakfast as advertised. It may have been because our stay was during the week, but it was kind of a let down.</p><br>Pleasant Stay<p>Stayed 3 nights at this hotel. The room was large, clean and comfortable. Area was quiet. Free breakfast included waffles, various pastries, cereal, coffee, juice & milk. Three nights was just over $100 so we felt this was an excellent value. The pool was small but nice. Check in and check out was easy and fast. Water pressure in the shower was great. Location was within easy walking distance to large hotels and casinos. We purchased a 24 hour pass for the Duece/Gold Line for $7.00...an excellent value. We went all over the strip and downtown.</p><br>Fabulous value, comforable stay<p>I booked this hotel because I had a conference at the Riviera, and the Trip Adviser reviews warned me off that place (with good reason). This hotel is in easy walking distance from the Riviera, Circus Circus, and the strip.

The room was clean and comfortable, with high speed internet included. I might quibble with the decorations. Why would you put in new, attractive brown granite counter tops in the bathroom, and then freshly paint with lilac colored paint? Why would you take a wallpaper border of brown and purple, and then paint the walls pale pink? Still, getting over these slightly strange decorating choices, this hotel is absolutely fabulous value for money. It was quiet and comfortable, and the manager was very obliging when I managed to lock my computer into the in-room safe. The breakfast was adequate and the serving ladies very sweet - they gave me delicious cake one morning.

I felt completely safe here, and for $29.99 a night (booked in advance), how could you possibly beat this? Highly recommended, don't hesitate!</p><br>So impressed need to tell everyone!!!<p>I was in town for an Arbonne Convention. I chose this property because I get points with Choice Properties and needed an ecconomical room. The price was great, but the surprising points were the size of room and how nice the decorations were, The bed was the best because I accually slept it was so comfortable I have an awesome bed and home so it;s very hard to get any sleep away, I slept great !!! The staff was very friendly and helpful, I had no problem using my laptop in the room (very important). The location is great especially if you headed for the convention center or anywhere on the strip. When we left, I left my ring in the room and as soon as I went to the front desk they had it ready for me, what a relief. Breakfast was simple but very nice, I would reccomend to family and business travelers. The pool was very nice just didn't have to get in, I will try on my next visit in Oct for my anaiversay. M. Sharp Boise ID</p><br>Nice room by Riviera and Wynn<p>Large room with a closet and 2 beds. No complaints with the exception of some people staying there.</p><br>Pleasant hotel<p>The hotel was conveniently established beside a monorail position, which supplied very simple get access to to the strip. I required a crib for my child and they provided a clean pack-n-play.They furthermore had highchairs in the restaurant which made it pleasant to consume and feed my son. The meal was delicious and they had a large assortment of nourishment to select from. They have a pool interior and a warm tub out-of-doors which was stupid for bathing in July. Overall had a very pleasant stay and room service was very quick and delicious.</p><br></body></html>
