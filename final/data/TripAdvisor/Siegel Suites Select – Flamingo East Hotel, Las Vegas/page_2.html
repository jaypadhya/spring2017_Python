Since the service was so good I stayed another night. I will defenitley come back to the Crestwood suites when I come back to Nevada.</p><br>Clean, friendly, safe!<p>I was in Vegas for a 5 day event at the Rio but didn't have a Rio budget. Thanks to the TA community for this suggestion! It was easy to find, quick check in, very friendly staff including the manager! My single queen room was clean and perfect for an extended stay. There was a full size refrigerator, 2 burner top, microwave and necessary dishes....saved $ making breakfast and bringing lunch. The parking lot at night is well lit...I came back very late a few nights and felt safe, no one bothered my classic truck. About 10 minutes to the strip and grocery, restaurants nearby as well. Highly recommend, especially if you don't want or need to stay on the strip.</p><br>Wonderful stay!!!!<p>The staff was very friendly and helpful for my stay here. When a smaller size cab came to pick up my group of friends the general manager was very generous to aid us in finding another means of transportation. I would recommend others to stay here in the future</p><br>Staff very friendly.<p>All staff, especially the manager, Robin, and Glichen were very cheerful and eager to help me feel comfortable with my one month stay. The location is great, even if using public transportation. Decent grocery/eateries within walking distance.</p><br>Great Experience<p>had a great stay , right next to Starbucks and close to the Strip. Rooms were like new . The staff was friendly . The place was quiet . The price seemed fair .I would highly recommend this place. The neighborhood was safe and well lit.</p><br>Highly recommended<p>We were looking for long-term accommodation and chose the Crestwood based on it's primarily positive reviews. We have to agree that the good reviews are warranted. We tried a couple of other locations in Las Vegas and the Crestwood is by far our favourite! The staff that we encountered were extremely courteous and helpful. The room was clean and had everything that we needed for a long-term stay. We appreciated that the fridge was full size - not a tiny one like many other hotels. We used the two burner stovetop and the microwave every day. There is not an oven but we can't say we honestly missed it. The laundry room was very clean and there is a small exercise room that had everything we needed. The hotel is in a nicer part of the city and we felt safe coming back to our room in the evening. Considering it's location on a busy road we found it quite quiet. We would definitely stay here again and highly recommend it. We had a car and everything was within a very short drive. The internet worked great - very fast.</p><br>Good value<p>Robin and Ghchen were very friendly and professional. I was skeptical about booking at first because of some of the reviews that I read, but decided to book anyway because of a good deal I found on Groupon. Robin and Ghchen made my stay such a good experience, they definitely bring the hospitality to this establishment and add value to the customers. The room is pretty standard but my fianc√© and I didn't mind because we were out most of the time.</p><br>great stay<p>I had a very relaxing stay and great service, the desk clerk Romeo Yabut was very accomadating and made sure I had superior service above and beyond. I suggest anyone staying in Vegas should stop in and check out the motels accomidations.</p><br>Best experience ever.<p>We had booked a suite in Crestwood for a period of 3 weeks and it was the best deal in Vegas in terms of location and cost. The staff are very friendly and helpful. Specially Greg, the manager, who was always making sure that we are well settled in and had everything we need. The best thing about Crestwood I would say is the feeling you get that you at home. Overall, It was a wonderful experience!</p><br>Relaxation<p>had to stay for a long time in Las Vegas and I'm really glad I chose this place as a hotel cuz it was perfect especially for someone who is looking for an extended stay like myself. Although the hotel is a bit far from the strip, it is located in a safe area in LV. Also many shops and restaurants are located near the hotel and the bus stations are also near which was perfect for people who use the bus service (which you should do if you are here for a long time since its much cheaper.

The hotel itself is neat and clean and the rooms are well maintained. The staff are very helpful and friendly especially Mr. Greg the hotel manager who helped us a lot during our stay at the hotel.</p><br></body></html>
