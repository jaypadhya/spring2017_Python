<html><head><h3>Siegel Suites Select – Flamingo East Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 6</h3></head><body><br>Good Value<p>I've stay in Crestwood Suites Las Vegas Flamingo few times in the last years. Las time I was their from October 'till December 2012. Now I am back in this hotel for a few days already and going to stay hear till mid July. This is not Trump Hotel. But for the Modest Price you pay this is the best deal in east Las Vegas. The Guest suites at this property feature kitchens with cookware and dishes, complimentary wireless Internet access ,free local and 800 calls, and premium cable television. Weekly housekeeping is provided, as well as copying and faxing free of charge.
Very Near by (2 mints, walking maximum) you can find Red Lobster, Starbucks Coffee, Subway, Carl's Jr .Macdonald , and Buffet Asia and Mariana Supermarket. The Front Desk Happy to help with every thing, special Mandy who always smile.</p><br>Great Experience<p>I am not sure where the bad reviews have come from for this place, but my wife and kids had a great experience. The hotel is older but very clean. The front desk really helped out with directions since this was our first time to Vegas. Clean, great people and cheap...cant ask for much more. The only negative was no pool.</p><br>Learn from others experience<p>We came from Prescott, AZ. for 2 weeks in Vegas. We love to go to La Costa Grill. They have night club with dancing, salsa and a taste of Nicaragua. Its next door to Crestwood ,on Flamingo.
We want so much to be close to this Dancing place that even that we read bad reviews, we go to sleep in Crestwood hotel. I was stupid not to believe the bad reviews i read here.

I would rather spend a little more & get a clean, quiet, relaxing hotel room.

This place is filthy and dangerous. Rust, mold, dirty bedding. Scary people every where
Lisa did not like 27 roaches in her bed , and she wrote- Sleeping in your car could be an improvement over this place
All what they wrote is smaller compare what you see in the reality when you get to your room.
Do yourself a favor and don`t be stupid like me , check in to another hotel.</p><br>Love It!!!!<p>Our room was spotless and the staff was great! The management team made sure we had everything we needed to have a great stay. We will tell everyone about our awesome weekend....only request is flat screen tv's, which the manager said is on the way.</p><br>Not Clean and NOT Friendly<p>I would NEVER recommend this place to anyone I know and would NOT recommend it to anyone I don't know! Stay away; this place is a dump...I never felt safe here one moment!

We Stay by accident for Boxing- weekend (Move from MGM). DO NOT GO THERE. The worse customer service ever experienced. For $168 for 2 days I want more. The receptionist gave Crestwood Hotel a bad reputation for life, not to mention the thin walls in your room. The neighbors noise when she .... was very loud (No joke) Management is unprofessional.
Room Tip: Go to Motel 6.

The front desk staff when I checked in was great and the 2 Managers I met were very caring that our stay was a good one. We will stay again next time in Vegas.</p><br>Very Clean and Friendly!<p>My wife and I checked in on April 25th and were greeted by a great staff that was friendly and helpful about the area. Our room was spotless, very surprising for a hotel with a low rate like we paid. We will without a doubt tell our family and friends about this place, and we already booked our next stay for next month! Definitely a hidden gem if you are looking to be off of the Strip, but just a short drive away.</p><br>Crestwood Flamingo<p>Pros:
Cheap rate

Near stores & restaurants

Fridge, freezer, microwave & toaster

Elevator

Laundry room



Cons:
Key problems many times in one day

Toilet overflowed. No maintenance or housekeeping. So I had to go to front desk to get plunger, gloves & towels to do it myself

Filthy floors. Black hair on bathroom floor. (I am blonde)

Old fashioned tv only in bedroom. I didn't turn it on.

Loud air conditioner

Loud neighbors/thin walls

Stinky hallways

I would rather spend a little more & get a clean, quiet, relaxing hotel room.

If you do go to this hotel, I recommend bringing your own sheets, pillows, towels & silverware. And wear slippers or shoes @ all times.</p><br>Nice Place<p>Everyone from the moment we first checked in was very friendly and made us feel right at home. The front deskman, Robin, was helpful with his advices.
Crestwood Suites was very comfortable. Large rooms. Our room was quiet.
The beds were comfortable. There was no smoke and no gambling so it was quiet and peaceful. No Swimming Pool but in December its not needed.
Room Tip: Only 3 floors, all looks good.

The front desk clerk was ok. She mentioned something about not liking having "...to deal with Expedia." I was glad she checked us in promptly since it was 2am when we arrived. The rooms were spacious but our comforters were obviously not laundered (who knows how long...). They smelled so musty that my sister had trouble relaxing; she barely got any shut eye. Quite uncomfortable. My nephew and niece felt very itchy all over after using the hotel soap but then again they both did not wear sunscreen. I'm assuming the soap only further irritated their sunburn but I admit it was their fault. Bathrooms were clean and towels restocked every day. Though we didn't cook during our stay I have to admit I was impressed by the kitchenette.
Room Tip: If you book through a 3rd party definitely call the hotel directly to confirm that the room(s) has b...
