More </p><br>Worst reservation system! What you see is not what you get!<p>Don't ever try to reserve online with this hotel. They have the most ridiculous policies about reservation. I booked 2 queen beds suite online and guaranteed it with a credit card. I indicated four adults are coming and even noted that we will be arriving at late night. We checked in at 12 am from a 6 hr drive ....
More </p><br>Worst Hotel Ever!<p>Worst Hotel Ever!! I booked a room with two queen beds on 12/31 for 151$. Absolutely not worth the money! The first staff checking us in was nice, she told us they only had one room with one queen bed and one sofa bed, and if we are not satisfied with the room, we can cancel the reservation right away....
More </p><br>Horrible experience - ABSOLUTELY NOT RECOMMENDED<p>Very bad experience. The hotel has horrible service. We didn't get the room we reserved and paid. We are a group of 4 with a reservation of 2 queen size beds - non smoking. But they only gave us a room with a queen bed, even worse, smoking room. The receptionist told us it was a room with a queen...
More </p><br>Comfortable and affordable<p>I flew into and out of Las Vegas and needed a place to stay for one night before a flight but didn't like the sound of the places closer to the airport. This place is an easy 15-minute drive away. The Crestwood offers great value for money. My room was immaculately clean and very comfortable. A huge bonus is that...
More </p><br>Pleasantly Surprised<p>This hotel was nice and clean. That's our first criteria when staying somewhere, and this hotel was just that. No frills, just somewhere to sleep while in town. We were in and out to visit a sick relative, but would def. stay with the family in the future. Microwave, fridge, 2 burners, sink inside your suite. Saturday night got a...
More </p><br>good value on the quiet side of the airport<p>Stayed here for 1 week while house hunting for relocation. The staff was friendly and efficient. The hotel has a guest laundry and ice machine. The rooms could use some upgrading but overall was adequate, good water pressure in the shower and full size fridge with microwave and electric cooktop. It was very quiet the entire time even though they...
More </p><br>Big room, nice price, &amp; with a kitchen<p>Our family of three stayed at this ‚ÄúExtended Stay‚Äù type property for one night in preparation for a 10 day car-camping trip. It suited our needs perfectly. Our room was large, easily fitting the two queen beds, a small sofa, a small kitchen, and the bathroom. There is a large open area in the middle of the room that was...
