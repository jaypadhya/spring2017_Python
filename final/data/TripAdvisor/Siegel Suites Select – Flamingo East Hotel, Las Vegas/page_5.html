<html><head><h3>Siegel Suites Select – Flamingo East Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 5</h3></head><body><br>A quiet comfy retreat in a crazy party town<p>It was just what I wanted: a quiet place off the strip, with a kitchen. I had to get away from the Michigan winter for a few days, and wasn't particularly interested in spending a lot of time on Las Vegas Boulevard (although the 202 bus takes you right down Flamingo Blvd to the strip for $2.00). I got an excellent deal on weekday nights at Crestwood when I booked my flight on Expedia. I was more than impressed with the roomy kitchen, complete with pots, pans, dishes and silverware. There was plenty of hot water in the clean and tidy bathroom, the heater/air conditioner in the room worked well, TV was just fine, and --best of all--the staff left me alone and never bothered me except to make sure I knew to check out by 11:00 am on my departure day. Admittedly I am not the typical Las Vegas visitor: I wanted to spend more time off the strip just shopping and hanging out. Las Vegas is a proper city with an excellent public library and good public transportation. Most of all I liked the Las Vegans: unfailingly friendly and courteous, from the lowliest homeless person to the most chic casino hostess---I never met a rude person during my entire stay.
Room Tip: The second floor is quiet, and there are washers and dryers on that level.

Otherwise we would never stay here. It was cheap and it had a fridge and kitchen which we needed for these 2 nights. When we checked in, the guy said he was going to upgrade us. Naturally, we were excited! Our room was in the next building. When we walked into the building it REEKED from weed and cigarettes. Our room was of course non smoking but what difference does that make when I have to walk in and out of a cloud of smoke all the time. We walked into our room and we were astounded. If this was an "Upgrade" we did not want to see what a downgraded room looked like. Everything is super old. The bedding, mattress, tv, couch. The bathroom was nasty. The toilet seat looked like it hadn't been replaced in 100 years. It was all scratched up and missing paint. The shower curtain was Filthy and there was an open used bar of soap in our bathroom. There was hair stuck in the blow dryer and I had a hair stuck in my clean towel! If you stay here bring your own soap and shampoo because the ones that they give you don't even lather up. It's like washing yourself with just water. We felt so dirty after our shower. It's an extended stay place so they do not clean the rooms daily and if you want clean towels you must bring your dirty ones down to the front desk first. How ridiculous. I probably caught an STD from staying there. GROSS</p><br>customer service<p>Everything are fine except customer service, here is the situation I was waiting for five or seven minutes in front desk to get some help I need to check-in and no other customer two employees are busy in the computer but I don't know how busy it is but at least you need to ask the customer "I'll be right with you" or something ? I think that's the proper way? so I can't wait I interrupted them anyway.</p><br>Not at all impressed!<p>Not at all impressed! We received a room in next to the guest laundry rooms. The walls were paper thin and we could hear doors banging and a man on the telephone for HOURS. I heard every word of his conversation. The view out our window was a wall ! The carpet had stains, the bathroom tile moldy - it was DISGUSTING! The urine stains was very strong. I called the reception and they answer for one day they cannot do anything. This "hotel" will never see me again.
Room Tip: Take another hotel !

The room was very clean and the staff was able to provide all the info needed on getting around with out a car. We will be back in August and look forward to another great stay.</p><br>Awesome<p>My gf and I were in town for EDC and stayed for 2 nights at the Crestwood. The staff was great and very understanding to our schedule ( sleep during the day and do not disturb). The room was very clean and free coffee in the morning!! We will without a doubt be back next year.</p><br>CHEAP CHEAT<p>We come to Vegas for EDC. We read the Good reviews. "Good Value" "Great Experience"
But its all Lies. The Free Wi Fi not working. I walk bear foot on the carpet and my feet paint black!! No room cleaning. and room was dirty. Its not too far from the Bally (30 mins. when you on the bus, but the bus not come easy .Maybe for ''wife and kids'' its good place but NO SWIMMING POOL? ITS 120 out.</p><br>terrible<p>We visit this hotel second time. The price was attractive so we decide to try it once more. Unfortunately our experience got worse. Bunch of drunk kids running, shouting all night long.
The kitchen floor was thicky as well as the bathroom. Defenetly this was our last visit in crestwood flamingo. Next time motel 6.
Room Tip: Good room in motel 6.

You better take another hotel . Toilet was not good.
Pay a little extra money and go somewhere else. Beds were uncomfortable and had hair on the pillows. Rug was filthy.
The fitness room is "temporary out of service" for a year long (asked the front desk)!!!
Maids woke me up twice for checkout even though I had booked another night!</p><br></body></html>
