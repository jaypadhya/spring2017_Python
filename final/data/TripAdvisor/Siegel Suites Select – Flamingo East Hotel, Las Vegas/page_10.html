<html><head><h3>Siegel Suites Select – Flamingo East Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 10</h3></head><body><br>Very pleasantly surprised<p>Great value. Should be rated 3 stars instead of two stars. Clean and well equipped.</p><br>Just the basics<p>Well, for the price it's a lot of room. Being a suites style, there is a kitchenette with dishes, pots, coffee maker toaster, micro and fridge. After the furniture you have just plain. Ours was an open room, very plain. And a strong smell of fresh paint. Almost too much. We'll see tomorrow after I have to sleep in it.
There is an exercise room that I will try out in the morning.
I brought my own food, so with this room I can save money.
This is my first night impression. I will add to this after I finish my stay.</p><br>frustrated in vegas<p>checking in was terrible - the clerk gave me the wrong rate, told me twice that I booked two nights, I explained to her that I had a print out of my confirmation for one night. She then told me she could only give a $3 AAA disc and that's it. I called after I booked online and asked about AAA disc - they told me that they would take $5 off when I got to the hotel and $5 off for booking over 2 wks in advance. I also had a $5 off coupon from the online reservations for booking it online that wasn't accepted. I had asked if we could ck in early (30 min) the lady was very frazzled, as if she didn't want to check us in.
The bathroom floor around the toilet in the room was very yellow & dingy. There was no counter in the bathroom to do makeup, hair, etc. My daughter had to sit on the floor by the front door to apply her makeup. It was very inconvenient
