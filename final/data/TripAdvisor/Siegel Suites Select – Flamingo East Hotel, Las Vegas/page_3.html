<html><head><h3>Siegel Suites Select – Flamingo East Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 3</h3></head><body><br>Are 0 stars an option?<p>We booked this hotel based on some of the reviews here. We booked for 5 days but left after the first. The walls were paper thin. There were hairs in the towels. The bed smelled and the mattress was sagging. The room was supposed to have a queen sized bed, but it was only a full. The room was dirty. The desk staff was marginally competent, but on checking out the general manager was rude. On check in, there was obvious "entertainment" activity being provided by two young women and their "manager" as well as suspicious activity occurring on the sidewalk adjacent to the hotel. The hotel overcharged us for canceling our reservation (they're allowed one day plus $99 penalty, and charged us for 5 days) and then avoided or flat out refused to talk to the booking company. They were rude and threatened to charge us more if my wife was not completely out of the room by 11AM. The best words I could use to describe this hotel would be "skanky" and "dirty". I did not feel comfortable leaving my wife alone at the hotel, and I did not feel our belongings were safe there. On returning home and checking our credit card billing, we now see that they've overcharged us for the hotel, the cancelation fee, and added a second cancelation fee ($100).</p><br>Best rates in town !!!<p>You don't, have to stay at an expensive hotel on the strip. Unless, you want ambience, and casino in the lobby. The hotel, is three miles from the strip. Public bus, just a half a block away. This,hotel has all the basics you need. Small, kitchenette, just a stove top, I miss an oven, but this will do. Bathroom, with tub and shower, sink, towels are provided. Complimentary, soap, shampoo, and dish soap. On the second floor is a public Laundry. Vending Machines and Workout room. Best, of all, by 7 a.m. free coffee !!
Everybody, that works for the hotel is courteous. Always smiling, always, willing to help you out with a problem. They, also, allow your pets. Rooms are smoking and non-smoking.
Plenty of parking even, when the is a convention.
Very, knowledgable,, about things to do and see in Vegas.
Many, thanks to Greg, Manager. Christie, Glitchen, Robin, Dan, Jamar, \Larry, Reha, and Robert. I hope, I remembered all. Kudos to the staff
Room Tip: First floor is the best.

Two of the gentlemen working there Greg Mahone and Romeo Yabut were extremely courteous and the bellboy refused to take a tip. Its just a excellent place with great accommodations.
Room Tip: Clean. Safe. Secure. Upgraded from Las Vegas clicky rentals.

Room Tip: Lower- numbered 100 level rooms very convenient to office and to parking.
See more room tips</p><br>Very clean affordable friendly and wonderful experience.<p>Robin was very friendly and professional during check in. Got me in my room fast and answer all my questions. Great hotel. Id come visit again as well as recommend it to others. They got all the good channels and a great room service menu when your hungry.</p><br>Great value for the money you spend<p>I'm an Italian tourist and I have been staying for an extended period at the Crestwood suites in Flamingo road, Las Vegas. They have really convenient rates for weekly and monthly staying. The place is quiete and clean. No luxury but anything you need for a comfortable stay. There is a really working kitchen in your room and a good supermarket is located at a walking distance. You can go to the Strip by bus in 10 minutes.
The staff of the hotel
is friendly and ready to help. Among them I would like to mention Romeo, Christy, Glichen and Jamar. Thanks to them and to all the others for making my and mine husband extended stay at the hotel a pleasent time. Paola</p><br>Close to Desert Springs Hospital<p>This is a great place to stay if you have a loved one in Desert Springs Hosp. Only a few minutes from here by car. Very clean, rooms large, staff very friendly. Lots of restaurants near by & only 2 miles from I515. Also close to the Strip.</p><br>CLEAN, COMFORTABLE AND CONVENIENT<p>My experience was a great one, Crestwood Suites is a very clean, warm and friendly hotel, very spacious. it was convenient to get to strip as well as buses run up and down Flamingo road every 20 to 30 mins. Great location, lots of restaurants, grocery stores, 7/11, pharmacy and gas stations walking distance. Definitly recommend for families or big group as suites are self contained with everything that is needed and the staff are very attentive to your needs.</p><br>Best Hotel Staff Ever !!!<p>While this extended stay hotel isn't all that to look at. The rooms are spacious enough with full size fridges, stove tops, coffee maker and microwave makes it perfect for longer stays. The interior entrance made it feel safer for me (a single woman traveling alone). What made this place really stand out was the STAFF!! Every single person I had contact with from Romeo and the girls at the front desk on the day shift and both the young men who manned it on the late shift were super helpful, just can't remember all their names. Every request was handled quickly and pleasantly. Just one of the best experiences I've ever had while traveling. Having experience in both property management and hospitality I know how rare and special it is when you have the perfect crew manning the ship.
Keep up the good work guys. Management if your smart you'll give em all a raise</p><br>Great Service<p>This hotel is 2 miles away from strip and it was wonderful stay for us. I stayed here last year as well and this is 2nd time stay for me in this hotel.

Rooms was pretty clean and big. Especially check was very quick and Romeo Yabut was very helpful and provided all necessary information during entire stay.

I definitely recommend this hotel to my friends :-)</p><br></body></html>
