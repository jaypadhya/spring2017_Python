<html><head><h3>Siegel Suites Select – Flamingo East Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 7</h3></head><body><br>Bad. Very Bad.<p>This place should be shut down. Terrible experience.

Appearance Looks much better on the outside.

I just look for a place to sleep and shower and I would rather go tired and dirty than to come here.

Usually I don't complain about lodging but this place is definitely off acceptable hotels.

Don't stay here. Poor quality. Horrible hole. Carpet very stained and overall run down.

This place is filthy and dangerous. Rust, mold, dirty bedding. Scary people every where.

Not a safe place to be there were drunks outside my room.

Terrible , filthy place, I was shocked when i saw the room.

They advertise free, high speed Internet, I checked its only 0.87 Mbps .

Itâ€™s take 10 minutes to open the Internet, impossible to watch anything but e-mail.

Add more money and stay somewhere else.</p><br>27 roaches and me does not = a "single."<p>I was doing some volunteer work for a month and needed a cheap place to stay. I have stayed in some pretty gross places as a college-aged backpacker-- for one night, until I could escape. Here, much older, I was stuck for 1 1/2 weeks (long work days and no chance to hunt for another place.) I have never seen roaches so big, so numerous, or so hard to kill. I kept all my food in the fridge-- all of it. There were chunks of chocolate on the carpet, indicating that the room had not been vacuumed. I asked that someone do something about the roaches; when I came home you could smell a spray but the roaches seemed to just ignore it!

An earlier poster mentioned hair on the wall-- I either had the same room or the "cleaner" really never rinses his or her rags! There was also hair all over the kitchen sink.

I was entitled to a "weekly cleaning" but except for new towels and new dirty-water mop stains on the bathroom floor, you could not tell it had been serviced. Most of the other rooms seemed to be packed with people-- perhaps if you were a group of shoppers, a large group of tourists or a college group this all might not bother you, or you might scare off the roaches? The place seemed full every night, anyway.

No assistance available with luggage-- at any time of day. No accessible room even though I had asked for one and had called to confirm it.

The one thing they were really good at was demanding payment by 11 am for the following night. If they didn't receive it (in person, even if you were paying by cc and had been offering the SAME cc for days) by 11 you were locked out.

I wanted to take a picture of the doormat on which was printed a slogan about it being clean, friendly and budget-priced. The mat was so filthy and covered with pistachio shells and squashed bugs that you could barely read it. Says it all!

Have I convinced you?

I moved to the Excalibur for the same price. I missed having the fridge but that was about it. If I could give this less than 1, I would. ICK.
Room Tip: Sleeping in your car could be an improvement over this place. It COULD be a decent budget hotel-- ea...

It is definitely not your average hotel, so if you have that mindset you will be disappointed. It more or less reminded me of a clean college dorm room which I thought was great for the price and my two week stay. The staff is extremely friendly here and always willing to help in anyway. I found the rooms to be clean and room service was done on Wednesday where everything was cleaned, vacuumed and towels were replaced. This is a great hotel for a long term stay as long as you aren't expecting a high class hotel. The only things that I did not like were that my microwave was broken (however I never asked to have a new one, so I am at fault as well) and the AC was broken in such a way that I would have to really fiddle with the knob to make cold air come out. Sometimes instead of cold air it would shoot out hot air that smelled like something was burning. Finally, I could not open my window as I was on the ground floor and my screen had been mutilated somehow and could very easily be pulled open and someone could climb in. I would not recommend this hotel for children as there were a few domestic fights going on on the weekend, however hotel staff dealt with these promptly. Also, on weekends the hotel would get quite loud at night time and if there was someone in the room above you, it sounded like an elephant trying to stomp through the roof.

Really it is not a bad place. Just picture a higher end college dorm with AC, wifi and bring some ear plugs and you will not be disappointed.</p><br>The worst hotel we have ever stayed in<p>The Hotel is so dirty that I do not have the time to tell it all. Let me put it this way, If someone paid me a $100, I still wouldn't stay here. Like Roaches, this is your place.

I realize this is a budget hotel, but it was so far below reasonable that I cannot believe it. Holes in the walls, balls of hair on the floor, broken plumbing fixtures.... It was filthy. It was like a rundown apartment complex.

The internet was so slow I did not enjoy it at all.

I felt unsafe there, and it was painful. They need to sell that place!

This was by far the worst hotel we have ever stayed in</p><br>Horrible!!!!<p>It was an awful experience!! The "Manager" some older odd lady knew nothing! Was very "ghetto"! The front desk worker was rude, and knew nothing. The room was not ok. Not any nicer than a Motel 6. I could not sleep due to traffic in the hallway, and the loud housekeepers across from my room early in the morning. All the dishes in my room were dirty, and I had nothing to wash them with. The refrigerator had eggs in it from previous person. I was there in early june and wont return. Too much competition, and I am sure better places are around.</p><br>WTH....Stay away from this one .<p>Beat up and very worn out place..You want Non smoking? Forget it..the WHOLE place smells like a cigar. Nasty..A/c sucks.t.v is super lame and the bed was made for Fred Flinstone...and it's a good taxi away from any fun..Never again.</p><br>BAD COHICE<p>This place is filthy and dangerous. Locks broken off, rust, mold, dirty bedding. Scary people everywher! would never stay here again even if they pay me.

The 'FREE' Internet its only a joke. bad joke. you cant really use it for anything, its only 0.5 mbt.

NO SWIMMING POOL IN THIS HOT! but if you like dog smell all over, this is the place for you,

NOT FOR ME
Room Tip: try another place

UPDATE 1:
I am writing this review right now from the hotel on the first of 2 nights here for memorial day weekend.

I came in rather early, at 2PM but the lady at the front desk (ill find out her name later) gladly attended us. We were accidentally charged for 1 night insteadof 2 but she changed it. No problem. And the lobby was amal but nixe looking. But theroom is a different story. We got room 316 (good there were elevator, which when I entered the room it awfully smelled like cigarette and the floor was super filthy.)

We were 4 of us(3 adults and child) and that room had only one small queen bed and a 1 person sofa, when we clearly asked ON THE PHONE for a king and sofa area. We went downstairs and claimed the problem and she gladly moved us to "an emergency room"..aka next building. We got there andthe hallways smelled like cigar and dog poop mainly becuase there WAS dog poop in fronr of the door we were getting. Thankfully it was cleaned immediately. Now the room was 80% better, yet it still had a weird smell(I was sneezing thewhole time) and had dirty floors and the sofa bed, this room was overall clean and did had utensils, saw no bugs and was big enough.

I will update later after the trip, along with pics

UPDATE 2:
Now that I'm back home, I finally learned how to upload photos, yeepee!

Lobby:
The lobby room was not big nor small but very clean and had a small coffee table for the morning coffee. The attendant were very nice and helpful. When I had to ask to clean the dog poop and the unclean room, they were gladly able to attend me with no conplaint or lengthy time.

Room 1:
Room 316 had the filthiest floor I have ever seen. Plus, like last update, on the phone, I CLEARLY asked for a two queen bed because it was 3 adults and 1 child. Yeah, the queen bed would of been ok and I would of slept in a sofa, it it was big enough to sleep on. But the sofa, were was the sofa? Please check the website, it says theres a separate living area, so that's why I had high hopes. Where was that "separate living" area???

Room 2:
I went to the lobby to complain about the issue, and the lady attended me (I should of gotten her name, she was the nicest person there) gladly changed us to another room, which I think was the last one, known as the "emergency room", as she said.
We headed to the third floor, to room 375, which is the next bulding over. The room was a lot better, yet carpet was still filthy. There was two queen beds, a separate living area(with a sofa bed) and a very big bathroom. This was good enough for us four folks. The A/C was perfectly working.

Bathroom:
The sink had trouble with water flow. Took a long time for water to go. Bathroom was very big and clean.


Kitchen:
Had like a litttle breakfast table. Ha all the utensils, compared to other reviewers that said no utensils here. Refrigerator and stove had no issues.




Pros:
-Huge parking
-Free coffee
-Nice staff
-Close to strip
-Huge bathrooms
-Nice sleep quality
-No bed bugs
-Cleaning request

Cons
-WiFI never worked
-Floors
-Weird fould smell in the hallways and elevator
-No swimming pool

Oh, I apologize for the picture being sideways.
Overall, I would definetely come back here, if there is no more suites available next time Oh and for check out, ask for Josue. He was very nice and funny at checkout.</p><br>Modest but priced right<p>We stayed at the Crestwood for five nights on business. We selected this hotel because it was much less expensive than other options around Las Vegas, we were looking to stay on the East side, and we wanted a kitchenette to prepare our own meals. The suite had a small kitchen with fridge, two burners, a bar-sized sink, a toaster, coffeemaker, microwave and tableware for two. This suited us just fine and we were able to prepare our meals using the frying pan and pot provided. For other guests, I would recommend bringing your own dish soap, sponge, paper towels, sharp knives (only butter knives are provided) and corkscrew if you plan to have a bottle of wine. We ultimately had to make a trip to buy these things, as there weren't any stores that sell them within a desirable walking distance. Our room TV was the ancient box model and the closed captioning didn't work (I did not report this to the front desk, though, since I had good books, but it would have been really nice to have captioning).

One disadvantage of this hotel was not having daily cleaning service. The room was very clean when we got there, but it was hard to keep it this way because the room was so small. Since we were staying for 5 days, this meant washing all the dishes ourselves, borrowing the vacuum from the maid, and accumulating trash and dirty towels. We have stayed in other suite hotels that had daily cleaning service. I would consider this carefully the next time I am looking at an extended stay hotel.

Another disadvantage of this hotel was the tiny fitness center which had only one treadmill and one bike for aerobic options. Worse, neither of them worked. The front desk staff were most apologetic but unable to fix them. The machines were really worn down and dated. Again, since we were staying for five days, this was a huge disappointment.

Things we liked about this hotel were: being able to park in close proximity to the entrance (less lugging of luggage), the friendly front desk staff, who I believe are trying really hard to provide top level customer service despite having few resources to do so, and the location, a straight shot to Bellagio, Caesar's, and the other megaresorts on the Strip. However, this hotel is several miles from the Strip and there are better options in closer proximity. I would not recommend this hotel to vacationers whose main purpose is to see the Strip or Fremont Street.</p><br>Cheap and confortable<p>I spent 1 night there. It's a simple room, but very clean and they have a kitchen, so you can prepare your own meal</p><br></body></html>
