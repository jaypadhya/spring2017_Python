Parking lot on weekends is full due to the night club next to the hotel, make sure you donâ€™t move your car because you may not have parking space when you come back.

The hotel is within walking distance of Starbucks as well as other restaurants and fast food places. Greg, the manager, was very helpful and friendly. The rest of the staff was also very friendly and made me feel welcome. While this is no 5 star hotel your stay will be stress free. The hotel is clean, quiet, provides fresh hot coffee every morning, and best of all FREE WIFI. Tons of delivery services service this hotel so if you don't feel like going out you don't have to. Keep in mind you do get what you pay for so if you are looking for a 5 star hotel this is not it but if you are looking for a safe and clean place to stay on your travels through Vegas I do recommend the CS.</p><br>Everything I expected and needed for my extended stay in Las Vegas.<p>I was very pleased with my experience staying in Crestwood for 2 months. I found it to be a quiet and safe environment. There is not a pool, but there is a fitness center. There is a grass area out back to walk dogs etc. They provide complimentary coffee every morning. The rooms are perfect size for two people. There is a full size refrigerator in the kitchen with a stove, microwave, and plenty of cabinet space. The staff are extremely accommodating. When I had family visiting, they put another full sized bed in my room to accommodate them. They were happy to arrange cabs and give me pointers about the town. I took the bus to the strip and think every other bus stop could be easily removed. I also found that most of the casinos don't charge for parking anyway and car rentals are very reasonable in Vegas. When my friends visited for a weekend they stayed in the Flamingo for alot more and it wasn't hard to go down the street to meet up with them. The Crestwood offered everything I expected and needed for my extended stay in Las Vegas. I am very pleased and thankful for the experience.</p><br></body></html>
