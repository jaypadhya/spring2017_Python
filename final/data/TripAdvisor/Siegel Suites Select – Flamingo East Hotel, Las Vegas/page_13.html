<html><head><h3>Siegel Suites Select ñ Flamingo East Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 13</h3></head><body><br>Nasty<p>The place was pretty gross.. the bathroom floors were stained yellow in one corner in the room we stayed (I'm assuming from urine or vomit) and the carpet floor was pretty gross too. Also, the elevator was broken when we were there. It looked okay at first from the outside... but not impressed with the room. The one thing that was good was that they have free wireless internet. During checkout, nobody was at the front desk and there were like 3 or 4 people in the backroom just chatting and goofing off while 3 people were at the front waiting to check out. Finally, one of the cleaning ladies came out and had to try and check us out but she didn't know what she was doing. They also wouldn't give me a receipt because I had reserved my room online and to just use that receipt. Whatever... don't recommend this place even though it is cheap.</p><br>Worst Hotel Ever<p>out of 14 years of business travel, I must tell you that this was the single worst hotel I have ever stayed in for business travel. The price I paid was more than most full service hotels I have used. The following problems occurred during my stay at your hotel:

1.The room was dirty upon arrival including an extremely sticky floor.
2.I reported the floor and was told that it was not the job of the desk and it would have to wait until the next day.
3.The next evening I had to call again because the floor and room were never cleaned!
4.The room was not cleaned during my stay for 2 nights.
5. No clean towels.
6. They did not give me the wake-up call I requested.
7. No batteries in the remote for the TV.
Basically I worked for them to take care of the room......

I will never stay there again!!!!!!!</p><br>Priced good for long stays... and not really that bad, but NO frills<p>Well, let's see, I've stayed here several times while in Vegas on business. Granted it's definately a no frills hotel, more like a furnished apartment. Therefore, no soaps, fancy shampoos, professional front desk personnel or any of the other ' hoity toity' things that go with a high end place to stay... but hey, when in Vegas who really stays in the hotel all day. :) I found it frustrating when doing the simple task of laundry that in the second building there were no laundry supplies so I ventured to the main building only to discover broken vending machines, but thanks to a friendly worker she gave me laundry soap...Also when requesting something from the front desk, as I did to get some extra pillows and was told they didn't have any, just try again later as I did and the other employee got me a few... remember the furnished apartment remark above. It's a good place to stay as they have a full sized fridge with dishware and a microwave so if there for sometime it can save some money when you buy things at the supermarket and can have a late nite low cost snack. In conclusion for the $298 for the week including all taxes from a sunday to saturday am stay it ain't all bad. The other 'pool' location from that site would be when you leave this site turn left onto S Eastern Ave, Turn Right onto the street just when you pass the Airport. Follow till you come to Las Vegas Blvd and turn Left, then the next intersection up it will be on you left.</p><br>always find it very nice. Clean, friendly, need more luggage racks.<p>Stay here all the time. Several times a year.

Nice and fairly clean, but needs more luggage racks.</p><br>Huge Disappointment at Hearthside<p>My wife and I booked online to stay at this self-proclaimed "all luxury suites" hotel, which was also represented on the website as having a pool, and a continental breakfast. At $69.95 + tax (on a weekend) it seemed a decent enough deal.

When we pulled up out front, the building seemed clean enough. But there was no pool. The staff said the pool was actually at the other Hearthside by Villager across town, and that it was a mixup. Same went for the continental breakfast. Generally the front desk staff were uncaring, unfriendly and very lacking in customer service.

Our second floor room was close to the laundry and a decent ice machine. Would have been nice if they had an ice bucket in which to put the ice. We had to use our own little "6 packer" ice chest as an ice bucket. The room had a 2 burner stove, a full size refrigerator and a newer microwave. But as kitchenettes go, this one was very spartan.
There were a few utensils, a couple of plates and plastic cups, a hot pad and a kitchen towel. There were no wine glasses. I had to borrow a corkscrew from the front desk and they seemed put out I even asked for it. There was no toaster, nor salt and pepper. And no dishrag or dish soap to wash the dishes. And, we only got coffee on the first night.
You could get more coffee if you wanted to ante up an extra dollar.

The TV channel selection was fair to poor. There were 20 or so channels, and they did have HBO. I was unable to get any local sports.
A mixed bag, here.

On the positive side, we had two fairly peaceful nights at the Hearthside. There were no disturbances or problems with unruly guests, that we saw. Overall our room was clean, but it was clear the management took the cheapest route possible when furnishing the rooms.
I suppose you could do worse than we did at an even higher room price.
But there were so many things lacking, we won't be returning to Hearthside and would recommend this only as a last resort.</p><br>STOP!! do NOT go to this place.<p>2,500 miles from home. 85 year old father. Prepaid reservations for two rooms next to each other, two beds in one room one in the room for Dad. Simple? They treated us very badly. Reservations,even prepaid ones were not REALLY reservations. They had a couple of rooms not what we asked for, or next to each other. Take it or leave it. Holiday Weekend. We take it. This is not a hotel it is a apartment building that rents by the week. There were creepy people everywhere and two fights broke out in a room on our hallway and I had to call the police(Who never came) The ice machine was in the building next door on the 2nd floor, the pool was at there other hotel in town. (Which we never found) None of the usual supplies were provided, paper cups, ice bucket, shampoo etc. I spent 3 hours on the phone trying to make other reservations but no luck. When we were in the lobby trying to get an ironing board They turned away a family with little kids who also had a reservation. BEWARE OF THIS PLACE.</p><br>Bom custo benef√≠cio<p>A localiza√ß√£o n√£o √© ponto forte deste hotel mas se voc√™ estiver com carro locado isso n√£o ser√° problema. O valor pago na di√°ria foi justo e o atendimento foi muito bom. Recomendo reservar com anteced√™ncia e pe√ßa andar alto e para n√£o fumante.</p><br>Horrible y alejado del centro (3 millas para ser exactos).<p>Las camas c√≥modas, pero el sitio es realmente horrible.Tiene una cocina dentro de la habitaci√≥n que es mejor ni mirarla (te quedas pegado) en la habitaci√≥n hab√≠a un sill√≥n que estaba lleno de lamparones y agujeros.La moqueta ol√≠a a yo qu√© s√©!!! El hotel est√° a 3 millas del centro a 8 millas de Downtown.Hay un bus, que pasa cada 1/2 hora y cuesta 2$ por persona (muy importante no equivocarse con el que cuesta 8$ y dispones de √©l durante 4 horas para moverte por Vegas)Nos sali√≥ CAR√çSIMA (160$)la noche porque coincidi√≥ que peleaban Paquiao y Mayweather (digo yo que ser√≠a por eso.Yo no lo recomendar√≠a en absoluto.</p><br>Prima voor een nacht<p>Omdat de nacht van de bokswedstrijd van de eeuw de strip niet te betalen was, voor 1 nacht uitgeweken naar de Crestwood Suites (net omgedoopt naar Siegel Suites).

Positief: aardige ontvangst bij de receptie, prima prijs/kwaliteit, grote kamer met complete keuken.

Minder positief: het rook niet heel fris, de buurt is duidelijk minder ('s avonds binnen blijven, kreeg ik het gevoel) en de zaken zijn wel een beetje oud en gammel. Geen restaurant in het hotel (wel wat zaakjes in de buurt).

Kortom, prima te doen als plek om te slapen. Geen locatie voor het betere vakantiegevoel.</p><br>Um bom lugar<p>Nos hospedamos de 12/09/2014 a 05/10/2014 e n√£o temos do que reclamar! √â um bom hotel com pre√ßo e local acess√≠vel, atendimento excelente, em especial sr.Robin e srta. Glichen (muito simp√°tica e atenciosa). Recomendamos e voltaremos numa pr√≥xima oportunidade!
