<html><head><h3>Siegel Suites Select – Flamingo East Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 12</h3></head><body><br>close enough to drive, but far enough away from the vegas madness<p>there are plenty of advantages to hotels that are off-the-strip. they are quieter and offer a refuge from the madness of the strip. this place is no exception. only 10 minutes drive from LV blvd, it is clean, cheap and well-equipped with a full kitchen. ideal place for your annual week-long Vegas binge.</p><br>Crestwood Suites, A Great Place, clean, Great Employees!!!<p>I got my suite for Super cheap on Labor Day weekend, suite was great had a sliding door to close one room to another, suite was very very clean. Theres lots of places to eat around the area at walking distances. The staff was very kind and the check in was very quick and as well was the check out, there was no line at all. I really recommend Crestwood Suites sooo much I actually wanted to leave a review.</p><br>What a find<p>Excellent location, great staff, tremendous value......stay off the strip and enjoy the REAL Las Vegas......</p><br>Great value for working folks...<p>Have stayed at this property when working in Las Vegas several times. Not a property I'd slect for a vacation - but perfectly suitable for a week's stay while on business. Yes, a little rough around the edges - but the staff more than makes up that. Very friendly and helpful. Not too far off strip - and close to many good local eateries.</p><br>Great Value!<p>I stayed at the Crestwood Suites for 2 weeks cos I was relocating to LV and needed to find a place that was inexpensive and close to the Strip where I was starting work. When I checked in, the room was very clean. Though yes furniture was not in absolute mint condition, but seriously as long as it looked clean and didn't fall apart the minute I touched it, it is fine. Throughout my 2 week stay, they did housekeeping twice a week since its extended stay and not a regular hotel. The staff are pretty accommodating though they are a little shortstaffed at the front desk so you will probably have to wait awhile before its your turn.

Location wise, there is a bus stop about 5minutes from the hotel, so for those without a car, it takes you 30mins on the bus to the Strip. There's a starbucks, grocery store, Macdonalds next to or across the street, so everything was convenient. IMO Crestwood Suites is really value for money and would recommend you to stay there if thats what your budget calls for!</p><br>you get what you paid for<p>when we first arrived at the hotel, it looked pretty good when we got into our first room we were pleased untill we sat on the bed and the head board fell off we called front desk was lauged at and then given a different room.

this is what was wrong with the room

1. stains on the carpet, walls, towels, and all over the bathroom
2. cigarrate burns on the blanket
3. the bed was rock hard
4. no toliet paper
5. room was not vacuumed
6. requested a full but was given a queen size in both rooms
7. the ac worked for about 10 mins

we were told that the room was not going to be cleaned untill we left. We called front desk for toilet paper and was told that we can pick it up there and if we want clean towels we would have to trade in the old ones for new. We will never stay there again</p><br>Great Stay!<p>My boyfriend and I stayed when NasCar was in town so almost every Hotel was booked. I was able to find this pleasent hotel through my entertainment book. The room was plenty for the two of us. It provides a full kitchen and a sofa and queen size bed which is really nice. At check in the staff was flooded with guest all trying to check in at the same time But the staff Melinda and Aldo were wonderful and very nice. Check In was a breeze.

Its not a hotel so they do not clean your room everyday but they let you know that when you check in with the welcome paper that they give you. If you need clean towels are you have to do is go to the front desk and they will swap them out for you!

It was a great stay at a wonderful price!

All these other people bashing this hotel is crazy! we had a wonderful stay!</p><br>OK / Good For the Price<p>COST: I neeeded an extended stay hotel (specifically kitchen facilities). At $50 a night this was the best deal of those in Vegas (hotel website stated $70 a night, thought I got a deal with a discount website for the $50 a night, only to find at check in that everyone was paying $50 a night). Note: $2 / day extra charge for phone, although wireless internet is free (but slow).

STAFF: Staff was friendly and courteous (although I was a little frustrated calling the day of check in to remind of late arrival, only to arrive and be told my reservation was cancelled because my credit card was rejected; I asked them to rerun my card and was told all was OK, "they probably just typed in my card number wrong"). Staff did print out airlines info for free (very nice!).

CLEANLINESS: Room cleanliness was "OK" when I arrived -- think they sprayed down all surfaces with cleaner but never wiped or rinsed, as a result everything had a greasy feel (I rinsed and all was OK). After walking around the room one day, white socks turned black. Bathroom floor had black soil spot in front of sink; I finally washed the floor and the washcloth turned black (at least I felt it was a little cleaner). Subsequent cleaninngs seemed better / more thorough (although the carpet needed a shampoo since I could tell they vacuumed, but socks still turned black). Bed sheets were clean (though wish the blanket were washed -- not my hair on it).

NOISE: Liked that the hotel was not on a really heavily trafficed / noisy street; my room backed to a residential neighborhood so was quiet (other than the college girl next door that came home drunk and loud every night between 4 and 6AM (not the hotel's fault though). Also, someone left a dog in a room down the hall which barked solid for over 9 hours (I called to ask what the front desk could do at 5 hours, then threatened to call police at 9 hours; dog stopped barking... don't know whether people came back or what).

EXTRAS: Excercise room - tread mill was OK (something about the setup gave shocks though); Laundry - facilities good.

OVERALL: Since I felt I was getting a $20 a day discount over other extended stay hotels in the area (confirmed by people staying at others at the same time), I was willing to tolerate the less than ideal cleanliness. If the room had been cleaner, I would rate the stay 'Above Average'.</p><br>I was quite pleased...<p>Given other's reviews here I was expecting the worst. I was given a room in the east building and it was just fine. It appeared freshly renovated, and there were only a couple of stains on the carpet. The room was equipped with bare necessities. All the appliances and A/C worked just fine. The check-in staff was friendly and prompt. I'd stay here again, provided I could get the east building again.</p><br>Make sure what you are paying for !<p>The quality of accomodation was excellent but everything else was not.
To express this succinctly - to keep the rate as agreed on during the reservation , three adults were invited to stay in a room with one bed.

I booked this room through a booking website (not directly with a hotel) I marked 3 adults for "Queen Suite". I checked the hotel website - nothing suspicious (they do not say how many beds in a "suite"). Upon arrival "Queen Suite" appeared to be a small room with one bed and nothing else to sleep on (no sofa, cot or extra mattress). It was explained to me that the hotel does not mind three people staying there and that "Queen Suite" means one bed. It was also explained to me that I would be charged for two nights anyway even if I walked out.
There was no manager present to yell at (6 pm) and I had to pay 36% more to get a room with two beds. I swallowed it with no means to vent my anger except for this website.</p><br></body></html>
