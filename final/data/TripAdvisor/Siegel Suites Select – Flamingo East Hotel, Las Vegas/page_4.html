<html><head><h3>Siegel Suites Select – Flamingo East Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 4</h3></head><body><br>Fantastic Stay!!!<p>I stayed here one year ago and liked it then. The room was perfect for what I was looking for (clean, kitchenette, secure, and not too far off the strip). My second stay there was just as great. The staff was very helpful (Romeo checked me in), and many of the staff recognized me from the previous year. Room was clean, wifi worked well, bed was soft....basically everything I was looking for. Would recommend this place to anyone needing lodging for just a night, week, or even a longer extended stay. You won't find another safe, competitively priced place as good as this one!!!</p><br>Great Service<p>We had a good time relaxing at this hotel. The room itself was adequate in terms of size and appliances, with a bigger-than-average bathroom as well as a nice bed.

The real distinction, however, is the service. I was impressed with the service we received from a young lady by the name of Glichen, who checked us in and remained friendly and attentive throughout our stay. Glichen was helpful in recommending a few good restaurants and pointing out some of the area's attractions, which was helpful considering we don't know the area.

On balance, this hotel is a good value and the service is excellent. I would recommend this place and chances are, I'll stay here again in the future.

And even when we needed to fix something in the room Maintenance guy Jamar was outstanding and very helpful and all was done professionally and very fast. Couch who had defects was replaced so kids didn't even notice. Roznieks Family</p><br>Better than others<p>Staff is very polite and professional.
Rooms are clean and big.
Washing machines in the motel are very useful, even if they work with dollar quarters only.
Refrigerator and microwave in the rooms.
Two things only didn't work: it's quite far from the strip and it's quite uncomfortable that it's made by two buildings and you can pass from one to the other to go from the room to the office.</p><br>Horrific beware!<p>This place pulling up looks normal as soon as you walk in the stale smell of cigarette smoke hits you.we had a room with 2 queen beds and 6 guests. When we opened the pull out bed it had no sheets and one blanket with a cigarette burn hole I called the front desk they rudely say when I asked for blankets and sheets that they have no clean linens and they weren't advertising the pull out bed! The sign out on the kiosk reads award winning service bull shoot! Never ever not even for one night! Beware!</p><br>Second visit and never again<p>My first time here at this hotel was 2 years ago and left on a rather positive note after issues were fixed. This time, I decided I'm never coming back again.
I came here for 2 nights on 4th of July weekend with family and pets (2 small indoor ones). I made my reservation via booking.com months prior and actually told them i would bring pets. I got here friday and Christy checked us in and treated us nicely.

ROOM:
We went in our room (303) and from view, it look nice. Once using the stuff, it's a different story. Making coffee was a nightmare. We didn't notice the hose from it was broken so hot water went flying everywhere. Microwave was making a weird noise and weird smell. For the stove only the left side worked. The sofa bed was also broken, I tried to lay down on it and mattress went through. I almost broke my ankle (nice..). The beds were fallen down. The a/c was broken and it sucked on this hot weather. The beds were fallen as well it was impossible to sleep on them that we end up on the floor.

On the morning of check out, they came at least 2 to 3 times to knock if we were leaving already, as well as a call at 10am. I kept telling them I'm already packing and need a few minutes. Once down there with all my stuff in a cart and ready to give the cards to check out I'm called for inspection. I'm taken upstairs with the manager to check the room as if the dogs damaged it or something. Told him all the bad stuff in the room and all I got refunded was the deposit.

For 2 nights I was charged via booking.com 119.97. Getting there the total was $150 with tax. Then they charge me a "pet fee" of $67. Due to me telling them the situation of the room I only got refunded the deposit of $27. NEVER AGAIN
Room Tip: Don't bring pets. they're not pet friendly
See more room tips</p><br>Clean and quiet rooms with a full size refrigerator and kitchen<p>During the week they have some of the lowest mid-week prices around.

Kitchen had a full size refrigerator and 2 burner stove, coffee maker, utensils, dishes and cooking pans.

Wi-fi.was free and blazing fast.

HBO, but really, who wants to stay in their hotel and watch tv- when you're in Vegas?

Another bonus is the deposit is only $25, and they accepted my Greendot Visa card for it too.

Starbucks, Subway and McDonalds nearby-walking distance</p><br>Perfect for a long stay<p>Clean room, well-equipped kitchen, and an incredibly helpful staff. What more could you ask for?

The location is perfect â€“ just down Flamingo, near enough to access the strip easily, but still away from the bustle. Quiet, great for working.

If you don't need a resort, this is the place to stay.</p><br>For stay of one week or more<p>If you stay a little longer in Vegas and have a car to drive around, you may consider staying in an apartment with facility's.
Some of the apartments on Boulder are maybe cheap but have no bed sheets, towels etc.
A nice alternative apartment hotel is Crestwood suites on Flamingo.
The price is right for what you get.
Large (hotel style) room with a very basic kitchen including basic utensils.
Free WIFI, and many cable channels on a medium size old TV
Free parking on site and within short reach of fast food places and shopping.
Only thing missing is a conventional oven or combi-microwave to prepare a frozen pizza.
Good value for money.</p><br></body></html>
