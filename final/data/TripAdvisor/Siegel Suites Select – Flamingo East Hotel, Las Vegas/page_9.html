I was just passing through Las Vegas and didn't want to stay at one of the casino/hotels. Crestwood Suites was perfect. Clean, good bed, kitchen area and clean bathroom. Also had a laundry area and exercise room. I would definitely stay there again. It was close to the freeway and in a nice neighborhood. Lots of resturants and supermarkets around. And on top of all they give you free high speed internet that cost more than $11 a day else were.</p><br>Good value, good amenities, but run down, &amp; basic are low quality<p>Before I begin, I have to say that the management at Crestwood Suites is unclear on the concept of social media. They are attempting to game the system; a prominent sign on the front desk offers discounts for positive reviews on TripAdvisor. Such offers make 4- and 5-star reviews highly suspect, especially considering the agreement you have to check before submitting reviews, part of which states that the reviewer was not offered anything by the establishment in exchange for writing a review.

I'd like to give Crestwood Suites a higher star rating. i really would. Although it's not walking distance to the Strip, it's not all that inconvenient if you have a car. It's 3 miles due east on Flamingo, a main drag that will get you to the heart of the Strip in 10-15 minutes most times of the day.

It's a small place, consisting of two 3-story buildings on the north side of Flamingo. I booked for 7 nights the included the July 4th weekend and got a great rate, averaging $40/night for the whole stay. For a holiday, and one where the WSOP was running, such a rate is nigh unto unheard of. It is positioned as an "extended stay" property, so through their website, you get discounts for 7 or more nights.

The room itself appears nice. Initially, I was given a room facing the street, I asked for one on the other side and was easily accommodated. The back looks over a residential area, but more importantly for me, no traffic noise (not that the noise along Flamingo is all that loud). The room is a decent size, with a single queen bed, and a desk that runs along one wall into the kitchenette area. The TV is nice as well, and wireless Internet not only worked nearly flawlessly, it is free. Having a kitchenette is nice. I only used the refrigerator, but that is very handy, saving you from overpriced Vegas food.

But when I checked out the bed, the mattress was thin and of low quality, on top of a box spring that was little better. The only good thing I can say about it was that I didn't wake up every morning with a horrible backache. The bed is squeaky and has virtually no support. You sink right in. The pillows are small as well. that said, everything looked relatively clean, and most importantly for Vegas these days, no bedbugs.

The counter space in the bathroom is small. Hot water comes quickly in the sink and the shower. The towels are almost impossibly thin and somewhat rough. Again, because it is an "extended stay" property, you don't get daily maid service. If you need more soap or toiletries, you have to trek to the front desk. That said, I successfully made what was there last the whole week.

The doors and walls and thin. I heard loud flushes and showers from people above me, and sound often through walls and outside the door.

My door key stopped working a couple of times, and they eventually gave me a different one. Also, one outside "security" door didn't shut all the way.

Finally, when I checked out, there were half a dozen police cars in the parking lot, more than there were of any other kind. I quickly packed up and left, not wanting to find out why they were all there.

It's a tough call. The folks at the front desk were polite and helpful, and the amenities that are important to me, such as internet access, worked well. But the property itself seems just cheap. And there are really no property amenities, specifically, no pool. There is, however, a washing machine and dryer on each floor. But just the cheapness of everything in the place, and the paper-thin walls, sucks the overall rating down.

The quality of the room contents is on par with, say the Imperial Palace, but the building construction is worse. The in-room amenities are better, but anything outside the room is nonexistent. The price is hard to beat, but it's impossible to find any way to luxuriate. I'm not sure it even rises to the quality of 2 stars, but there's no option of 1 1/2. But it's also not in a seedy area of town, and other than the police car experience when leaving, I never felt uncomfortable walking around. There's an Albertsons and a Target just down the street as well. But it definitely does not rate overall any higher, and anyone who claims so is being influenced by the Crestwood bribe. Don't fall for it. It's certainly not a horrible place to stay, but it definitely is at the lower end of the comfort spectrum.</p><br>Could have been better.<p>We stayed at the Crestwood Suites for three nights. On the positive side, the rooms are good sized and the price is right. But the property is a little run down. Carpets are not clean, the white vinyl floors in the bathroom are stained yellow and you will choke on the dust going down the stairwell to the lobby. Lastly, the mattresses are plastic covered and not comfortable.

The worst part of stay came on Saturday night when a group of party kids brought the party to their room next door to us at four in the morning. They proceeded to yell and pound the walls until the sun came up. This is a party hotel for kids. Before booking I saw some of the other posts with this same comment and I should have listened.

And don't even think of walking to the Strip from the hotel. It would take you an hour at least.</p><br>A wonderful stay in a home away from home<p>I‚Äôd like to recommend the Crestwood suites E. Flamingo rd. I enjoyed my stay there.

The room itself was large and spacious, and the fully equipped kitchen was also nice. Great location near the strip. I will be staying here again in the future.</p><br>Clean, friendly, mostly vaccant<p>I always stay here love this place has a kitchen & is peaceful</p><br>Convinient and Friendly<p>I booked a wrong location thru a third party and they told me they have to charge a cancelation fees anyway. I called the crestwood that I wanted to book, the lady who answered the phone was very cheerful and kind that she told me to try again. And book directly thru them next time so they can help me better.
So I called the third party again and surprizingly, they canceled my resavations without the fees.
I was so happy that the lady who answered the phone at crestwood was really cheerful and kind! Her name was Deanna.
And also I appreciate Zory for understanding my situations and being so kind.
Thank you so much!</p><br></body></html>
