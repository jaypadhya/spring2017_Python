<html><head><h3>Extended Stay America - Las Vegas - Midtown Hotel Reviews Page 1</h3></head><body><br>NOT UP TO STANDARDS<p>I travel all over the US for work staying at ESA as much as possible. For the most part they are nice but my stay at the Las Vegas Maryland ave. Was poor to say the least. My room smelled of smoke, I informed the front desk and was told they would clean it the next day....they did not. Promised to clean it the next day......They did not. The third time I spoke to the manager and she said "I can spray some FABREEZ" I was forced to sleep with the window open. Reading some of the other reviews this is an ongoing issue. They let people smoke in the rooms you can smell it...may have to call the fire marshal. next time. The stove did not work and the fridge was warm at best. I am forced to go back to this location on the 30th.......I will let everyone know how it goes.
Room Tip: The room was clean it just smelled of cigarette smoke and the staff could care less.

Bare foot dirty patrons in lobby...horrible and will never stay here again. The staff were very nice but thats the ONLY positive of this cesspool.</p><br>Was just OK<p>Overall the stay was Ok. But dissapointed when the hotel staff said the room will be cleaned up only if you stay long duration, more than 8 days. The hotel is located in a nice place. But far away from the strip.</p><br>2 star is enough!<p>Got in & d smell of smoke is already present even its a NO smoking facility. The bed is noisy, the shower is so slow, the sheets r ok & there is no water or ice bucket inside d room. The lady on d check in doesn't know the wifi network. And it's far from the freeway. Sorry but Can't really recommend this place unless there's nothing else.</p><br>Nice alternative to the strip<p>The rooms have kitchens with full refrigerators, which is a nice touch if you're looking to save cash not only on lodging but also on food. Good place to go if you want to be away from the craziness of the strip. The downside is the pet policy is too lax, someone had a dog that wouldn't stop barking half the night and no one from management did anything about it!</p><br>No smoking, No casinos<p>I appreciate it that it's a totally non-smoking hotel. The neighborhood and the hotel itself has a quiet, homey feel to it. I've been working and visiting our stores in the area so it's most helpful I'm spared noisy casinos that's usually at the ground floor of Las Vegas hotels. The rooms are spacious and very clean. Even the drawer interiors are dust free and smell free. The staff are all friendly and accommodating. Price is very friendly too. If one's staying long, one might be wanting some more variety to the staple breakfast choices of oatmeal bars, muffins, apple, orange, and oatmeal packets. But all in all, I highly recommended this hotel. Will be staying there again, the next time I'm in Vegas.</p><br>Pleasantly surprised!<p>Stayed in this Extended Stay America for three nights very recently. Found the room to be VERY clean! Staff was friendly. Property felt secure and has a great location. Hotel is 100% non-smoking, which I appreciated. They care completing a remodel and I stayed in a remodeled room.

Points for improvement: no hair dryer supplied, towels were very low quality and discolored, no triple sheeting (not unusual for a hotel of this level), but blanket on bed had holes from cigarette burns. Nice new bedspread, but under that was this old blanket, there were lots of doors slamming during the night. Ear plugs fixed this for me.

Bonus: most of the time was able to stream Netflix using provided wifi without purchasing upgrade!

Overall, I was pleasantly surprised with the nice, clean room and had a nice stay!</p><br>Clean Rooms, But Simple<p>Not a bad place. A clean room to rest your head. Our room seemed a bit antiquated, but not bad considering the price was right. It's not the most gorgeous place but was a good place to rest for the price. There wasn't a pool at this facility but you could go use the one at their sister Hotel on Flamingo Blvd. I wish there was maid service, but there was none. Overall for the price it was a good stay.</p><br>sooooooo unbelievably helpful and generous.<p>THese people who work here are beyond angelic. They helped me when no one else would when I was in a very dangerous situation. I highly recommend this hotel specifically very clean and everyone is unbelievable. Cannot rave about them enough.
Room Tip: most are good.

This venue is about 20-30 minutes of walking distance from Concention Center which makes it easily reachable. Spending all day at the event, I needed a place to have a good food - so I loved visiting Denny's diner right around the corner.
Overall, this hotel is worth it's money.</p><br></body></html>
