<html><head><h3>Extended Stay America - Las Vegas - Midtown Hotel Reviews Page 9</h3></head><body><br>They were Great !!!<p>I had to stay at this hotel for a surrogacy we transferred next door with Sher Inst. this hotel was awesome and the people there were so sweet. I highly recommend this hotel.
I will be there again and praying for same luck as we had before. When the couple I am working with asked about a Hotel I told them about this one and how great they were. They booked rooms with NO issue what so ever.</p><br>In Vegas! This is good for the money!<p>With weekend prices on the strip of $250 per night or more, the Homestead Studios Suites hotel is a blessing. I stayed here last weekend for a price of only $89 plus tax. It is my second stay at this hotel.

It's location is about five blocks from the strip in an area where there is a hospital across the street and the UNLV two blocks away. Mainly business around with a smaller of amount of residences. It is an extended stay hotel for business travelers, contractors, agents, etc. Therefore there is no luxury, fancy suites, puffy drapes or concierge downstairs to wait on your every wish. It is a simple, clean, studio hotel with a kitchen and a bathroom. A rental car or taxi is required to get to the strip. The travel area between the hotel and the strip is not something I'd want to walk through at night, but perfectly cool in a car.

On convention weekends this hotel can jump up pretty high (around $150 per day), but for regular weekends it is bargain. I do higly recommend it and will stay there again on my next visit

Thank you!

GT</p><br>Very Poor Guest Service<p>Hotel does not seem to know exactly what guest service means. The hotel manager Nur A is very arrogant and front desk clerk Rosa is not only rude but does not know what she is doing. It took us more than 20 minutes to check in and another 30 minutes to check out. Having a front desk who has been there for 6 weeks is not an excuse for a very poor guest service. Our complaints fell only into her deaf ears. When we checked in the manager was present at the front desk and seems to impress that he is busy doing something but actually he is not doing anything and was just looking at the poor front desk clerk do her job and not giving her any assistance even though other guests were waiting to check in.</p><br>Excellent Experience!<p>I had originally checked on the reviews and thought "Oh No!" However, I had made my reservations and needed a place to stay for my two week training. What I experienced was a very polite, helpful staff, a very clean and efficient room, and lots of peace and quiet. Everything about my stay was excellent. The staff was always more than accomadating and I found the area to be very safe. I have stayed in Vegas "Off Strip" before and found it to be scary but this was great. I had great comfort in knowing that my vehicle was safe. I would stay here again in a heartbeat and would recommend!</p><br>Avoid the Homestead<p>Please avoid this hotel, it was a disaster. Our business group was here for a convention and the room was booked for us on the Las Vegas end. We couldn't believe how disgusting the rooms were, and everything else in town was booked. There was no internet service, there was no maid service for an entire week, on a business trip! We had to buy towles at the mall it was THAT bad. The rooms were dirty, they smelled, and the air conditioning was broken for six days in Las Vegas!
Everyone complained, the hotel was so subpar we couldn't even laugh about it. Our company terminated business with the travel agent who booked us there.</p><br>Hated the Homestead<p>The absolute worst hotel I have ever been asked to stay in. I was here for business not pleasure and asked the business I was meeting with what was a quiet hotel nearby. This place was a waste of money, and a depressing place to return at the end of the day.</p><br>Homestead<p>I stay in this hotel frequently for business and the management always is friendly. The location is convenient as it is near a mall and many restaurants.</p><br>Preço justo<p>Já me hospedei em vários hotéis desta rede e neste a satisfação não foi diferente. Excelente custo benefício. A localização não é o ponto forte mas o valor da diária foi justo. Como estava com carro locado não me preocupei por longe do burburinho da Strip. Recomendo.</p><br>Estancia agradable<p>El hotel es básico pero posee todo lo necesario para pasar una estancia agradable, aunque modesta. La conexión a internet es buena y gratuita, las habitaciones son amplias, la cocina correctamente equipada, y se presenta como una buena alternativa de alojamiento para aquellos que necesiten realizar una estancia a largo plazo, o para quienes deseen visitar el Convention Center y visiten Las Vegas por circunstancias comerciales. Para nosotros que hemos acudido al Sema Show, nos ha resultado una extraordinaria alternativa y elección de alojamiento. Este hotel ha cumplido nuestras espectativas en cuanto al confort de sus habitaciones y la calidad de sueño que hemos podido conseguir.
