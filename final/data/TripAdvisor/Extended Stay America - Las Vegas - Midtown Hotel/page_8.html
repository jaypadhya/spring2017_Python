<html><head><h3>Extended Stay America - Las Vegas - Midtown Hotel Reviews Page 8</h3></head><body><br>Mini kitchen is a great convenience<p>This was a real bargain for a weekend night in Las Vegas. Rooms were comfortable. The kitchen with refrigerator and microwave was soooo convenient, even if you don't want to cook a meal, it is wonderful to have the fridge to bring back meal leftovers, stash some cold beverages or keep milk for breakfast cereal or yougurt for a snack. The staff was helpful and efficient. The location right across the street from the hospital is a huge plus if you have the misfortune to be in town for family medical reasons. Restaurants, grocery stores, shopping mall are all close by. The Maryland Parkway bus line runs directly to/from the airport with stops a short walk away, within the same block as the hotel. Limited desk hours (7am to 11pm) and not having maid service every day make sense for a property catering mainly to long term stays. If you can get past that, this is a great bargain choice for shorter stays, too. It might be a bit cramped if you are really staying for weeks and have more than one person living here.</p><br>I LOVED IT AND WILL GO BACK! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!<p>The rooms were clean, and staff was friendly. The hotel is located about 3 miles from the strip, great price. We also got 15% discount at the Dennys located next door just from staying at the Homestead suites. I highly recommend this hotel. I have no complaints.</p><br>overpriced, slow internet<p>I stayed here for a few weeks, and I could have found some place better for the price if I had known Vegas better. The fridge was very loud, the blanket had cigarette burns in it, the internet is VERY slow - cannot even watch youtube or download anything. The staff is friendly, you get dishes and microwave, toaster, coffee maker, laundry on site. There's no pool. It is quiet though, and I needed a lamp fixed and they came to fix it in a couple of days. It's not good in the long term however.</p><br>Decent Budget Hotel<p>I've been here at the Homestead Midtown, Las Vegas, for about 2 months and have been in 3 different rooms so I have a good idea of the overall environment. I'm not going to give it 1 star and say it's horrible, or 5 and say it's the best, just an honest review of my time here. I'll go in order of the categories listed.

Value is pretty good. I was initially placed here by a travel deal website for a week and payed about 30 dollars a night for their "deluxe" room. After that week I moved to a smaller room for about 700 a month. You get tv with about 30 channels, an ac/heater, and wifi for a one time 5$ charge. Be forewarned with the so called "hi-speed wifi," it's more like bad dial-up. You're not aloud to watch video or music, so that means no youtube, hulu, last.fm, or even news video clips. This is most of my internet usage so that was a major disappointment. It's also an unsecured wifi connection so I wouldn't recommend sending or receiving any sensitive emails, purchasing anything online, and make sure you change any passwords used once you get back home.

The rooms felt small but not cramped. The first room, which was their bigger "deluxe," came with a king sized bed and couch area. I then moved to the smaller room size with a queen sized bed and lounge seat instead of couch. Both sized rooms have an open style floor plan with lots of storage space. They both come with a full kitchen that includes a coffee maker, toaster, microwave, stove-top burners, sink, dishes for 2, and a full size fridge. The beds seem comfortable enough but nothing special. One downside is the noise: with thin walls, loud slamming doors, and pets aloud you may hear barking at all hours (which has been the case the last week).

The location is below average. You're miles from the strip so it's either 7$ (24 hour bus pass) for about an hour long bus ride or about 20$ each direction for a 20 minute cab ride. It's right next to a major hospital and mall but about a mile from major grocery stores.

Cleanliness is definitely it's weakest point. When you first walk in it looks pretty nice. Then I looked behind the bed/nightstand and found used cue tips, candy wrappers, and years worth of dirt. There's also a slight smell that wont go away no matter now much I clean. The carpets are dark and look clean at first, but within minutes of walking around your white socks with be brown. I vacuum weekly, but the carpet really needs to be steam cleaned, which I assume also hasn't been done in years. The overhead vent in the bathroom is clogged with dust but that's pretty standard for any budget hotel. Overall everything else was in pretty good condition, just don't look behind the scenes, ignorance is bliss.

Service is by far the best thing of this hotel. Almost all my experiences with the staff have been friendly and helpful. They allow you to change out fresh sheets and towels every week, although there is no cleaning included unless you pay about 100$ a month for weekly service. There's an in house laundry mat that costs 3$ a load. There's also a small convenience closet next to the front desk that has coffee, drinks, snacks, and toiletries for decent prices.

Overall, it's been an ok experience. I'd recommend the Homestead to someone that wants a cheap hotel and doesn't care much about cleanliness or location. If you plan on getting a rental car, and just need a cheap place to sleep and eat, this is a good choice. If you have young children or are bringing your special someone I wouldn't stay here. You get what you pay for.</p><br>Will never stay there again<p>Required to make copy of Drivers License and credit card when I made reservation.
Few weeks later discovered that some was trying to use my i.d. with the copies made at the hotel. Fortunately the person was arrested before any charges were made on my card. When I contacted the management and told them what happened, there was no apology. Did not even offer to look into the matter.</p><br>Great place to stay in Las Vegas<p>We stayed at Homestead Suites in early June. I picked this property based on the reviews that I read on TripAdvisor. This hotel is great. First, the staff was very gracious. I had a few simple requests. We were traveling with a small dog and we also needed a roll-away bed. The front desk handled my requests perfectly. Our room was on the first floor, near the door. It was easy to take the dog out and we were close to our car. It was great to have a fully stocked kitchen. We were able to eat leftovers and have cold drinks in the fridge. The hotel was very well maintained, inside and out. It is a few blocks from the strip, close to stores, stations, etc. I would recommend this hotel to anyone traveiing to Las Vegas. We'll definitely be back!!!</p><br>it's worth the value.<p>The only thing is the room, especially the rug, wasn't clean enough for us who has a crawling baby. The room was cozy and fairly close to the Strip. Actually, it's very close by private car, but two bus shift is necessary by public transportation.</p><br>Great place to stay if looking for low price, cleanliness and friendly staff<p>i stayed at Homestead for second time in two months (due to relative in hospital, then in therapy facility). it was much more reasonable than Strip hotels, had complete kitchen so that I did not have to eat out every meal. It is quiet and clean and i have always been made to feel welcome. The maids do not come every single day, as it IS an exended stay hotel, but how many times do you change your sheets in a week? IF one would want to hit the casinos or see shows, they are mere minutes away. There is a Denny's next door and that is very handy, as well.
I am going back in two weeks and will stay there again, as it is perfect for someone one in Vegas for business or personal reasons.</p><br>Dishonest, Stressful<p>Had a nephew in a coma at Sunrise hospital. Needed a place for family to sleep in shifts. Everytime we talked to them the prices changed to a higher price. Finally agreed on a price and later found out they charged us $40 more than agreed upon. He agreed that he quoted us that price but couldn't do anything about it. He adjusted a litlle but not what we were promised. As we walked each room it took us 4 rooms to find one that could even be okay to stay in. The first one he showed us had poop in the toliet. The others were stinky and bedding not washed. It got to the point that it was ridiculous and moved to a different hotel. They were very dishonest and we felt like they were taking
advantage of our situation needing to be close to the hospital. Very stressful</p><br>Fantastic stay<p>The whole staff went out of their way to make my stay next to perfect!</p><br></body></html>
