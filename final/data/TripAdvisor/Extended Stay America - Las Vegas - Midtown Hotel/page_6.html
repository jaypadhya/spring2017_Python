The staff answered all my question with a smile!! I would recommend to anyone that has to stay n that area!!!! Thank you kindly to the staff;for Ms.Evita was a friendly face that helped us upon check in!!! :-)</p><br>Superb Hotel and Helpful Staff!<p>I spent two weeks here while apartment/condo hunting Angie helped out during our Check-In Process. She basically gave us the play by play of this place. She was very informative and helpful. I just wished they had better WIFI. You can't really complain about WIFI when you get premium Showtime channels in your room/suite though. So It kinda makes up for it. Also the COMPLIMENTARY Breakfast was a plus also. Thanks once again ANGIE and the FRIENDLY STAFF at Homestead!

-James W.</p><br>Friendly staff and good value<p>Thank you for a great stay. Julie was very informative and efficient in handling my phone reservations, and Johnny was extremely welcoming and friendly at the front desk. He answered all my inquiries about amenities and shopping options in the neighborhood. The room was clean and spacious and as described on their website. The kitchenette with stovetop and full-size refrigerator saved me time and money, as did the complimentary grab and go breakfast. I especially liked the towel exchange service, free wi-fi, and onsite 24/7 laundry facilities. My overall experience during a one week stay was perfect and I will definitely be back!</p><br>Good hotel for events at the convention center.<p>We stayed here for a three a day volleyball tournament at the convention center. The hotel was close to the convention center. The staff was polite and the rooms were clean. The hotel was quiet. Having the kitchen in the room was a great money saver and a convenience. The breakfast in the lobby was good as well.</p><br>badly equipped kitchen, unhelpful manager<p>In January this year my husband and I spent 2 weeks in this hotel. We had stayed in numerous Extended Stay (before it went bankrupt) and knew what to expect incl. the rather minimalist equipped kitchens. However the equipment in this hotel was even below that standard. When I asked for soup spoons and a salad bowl and a better frying pan, a lady by the name of Julie (?) (she said she is the manager) accompanied us to the room to "show us that all we need is there!" When I insisted to have at least soup spoons she let me know in no uncertain terms that the equipment in this kitchen is exactly to Extended Stay standards and suggested that I go to the Thrift or Dollar store nearby to buy what I need. Next morning we asked for 2 additional pillows which she refused to provide saying there are no spare ones, though the hotel was far from full. I must say the aggressive, arrogant and unpleasant approach towards clients of this lady goes beyond anything we have encountered in all our world travels.

I wish however to add that the kindness of the personnel at reception (all times of the day) as well as the service rendered by the room maid have largely compensated the unprofessionalism of the manager.

We would however not stay in this hotel again.</p><br>Hotel with 5 star service<p>I was not expecting much for the price paid but boy was I wrong. This type of hotel would not normally be my first choice but now that I know what this hotel chain offers I will stay with them whenever possible. The rooms were very clean with kitchens and a comfortable bed. Best of all the customer service was extraordinary. Every staff member went out of their way to make sure that I was happy and asked how my stay was. Cela helped me with directions and maps, Julie helped me with printing documents and boarding passes, the maintenance man helped me with my luggage and they all did it with a genuine smile. I was so impressed with the service that I've already told friends about the hotel. I will definitely come back next time I'm in Las Vegas. If you're looking for great service and a reasonable price this is the place for you.

From the time I showed up for checkin, through the time of departure, the staff was eager to show me that they wanted to earn my satisfaction. Although not excessively large, elaborate or expensive for a modest studio room, it was comfortable and had many of the conveniences of a sensible home. The parking lot and exterior was clean, and had a fresh appearance. The public areas were also clean. Would recommend to anyone who expects a great value for their money with caring staff, and does not expect elaborate accommodations or over the top luxury.</p><br>Very nice for the price!<p>I only paid a total of about $68 for two nites using Priceline (includes all fees and taxes) so I was not expecting much. But for the price and star level this place was a great deal! Full frig, 2 burner stovetop, microwave, HD LG TV, nice shower, free continental breakfast, and the staff was nice! I would definitely stay here again and recommend it to my friends.</p><br>Feels like home.<p>I am a Travel Nurse a long way from home, everyone who works here are very friendly. The room i have is wonderful it's a 1 bedroom suite. it's like being at home i love the room and the staff here are excellent. the day time front desk person Johnny Garcia is wonderful he is always willing to help with directions for shopping (my favorite past time) . been here since October and i'm still here now in January. I have extended my contract at the hospital and i am going to extend my stay here. who knows i may just move to Las vegas lol..I also like that shopping is in walking distance for food and the mall and not too far from the strip. Keep up the good work!!
Room Tip: the deluxe suites are very spacious.

Had been on Strip paying much higher rates and moved to be near hospital. Proximity of this motel to nearby hospital made it very convenient. Will consider for future plans when visiting again and avoid the Strip. Rooms have great little kitchens, staff are friendly and property is clean.</p><br></body></html>
