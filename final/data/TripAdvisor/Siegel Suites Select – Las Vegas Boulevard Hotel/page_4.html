<html><head><h3>Siegel Suites Select ñ Las Vegas Boulevard Hotel Reviews Page 4</h3></head><body><br>Great Place!<p>My wife and I stayed at this hotel over the weekend and had a great experience. The rooms were spotless and the manager and his team were very friendly an made sure all of our needs were met. It may not be on the Strip , but it is only a short 5 min drive. We would without a doubt stay again.</p><br>Only use as a last resort<p>When we checked in, the front desk clerk could only find one of the two rooms we reserved and had a paid receipt for. We were advised to check with our travel agent (at ten pm on a weekend). We asked to see the manager and after a few minutes came back with our second reservation (which he just found on this desk, the reservations were made three weeks earlier) The rooms were small and not well maintained, the bathroom floor was sticky (probably had not been moped in months), There was not soap or shampoo in the rooms, the tub could not be turned off, alarm clock could not be set. I would suggest that anyone coming to Las Vegas check the casino's first. They offer "lost leader" hotel rates to get guests in to drink and gamble. The rooms are much more comfortable economical and clean. Would not uses this hotel again except if I could not find any other place to stay
Room Tip: Don't stay here

Things I hated: The cleanliness of the room is terrible, especially if you're a germaphob like me. The floor is dingy. The walls, in the room and bathroom, are supposed to be white but stained to the point that they are yellow. The shower head has a bunch of calcium/rust build up. My head board has mysterious dried white stains. The ceiling over the kitchen had brown spots. Though I'm on the non-smoking floor, I cam smell the smoke in here. Seriously, if I weren't working this entire trip I could clean everything myself. Oh and it's an old hotel and it shows. The furniture is super dated. Of course, that would be fine if it were clean. When I told the front desk about the room, they offered to switch me but I just couldn't risk being anymore disgusted. In my experience, once you've seen one room you've seen them all.
Oh, one last thing, the internet connection here is pretty bad too. Maybe because of where my room is but who knows. It's super slow and the connection drops constantly. I writing this review from my phone.

I guess you get what you pay for! The rate is reasonable, downright cheap.
Anyways, this place could use a deep cleaning. I would stay here again if that improved but until then...</p><br>An average one!<p>The location was central still confusing...difficult to search... The hotel was clean... Room was ok... Service not so good, but food was better than expected...
Business district was nearby... Shopping areas were closer... I would rate 5.8/10. .. Average!</p><br>4 Star Hotel for the $$ of a 2 Star<p>My Fianc√©e and I made a impromptu trip to Las Vegas for the 2012 Beard and Mustache Competition. I made our reservations on Friday, and on Saturday we arrived to Las Vegas a little earlier than expected. Robin and His staff were great! They let us check in early, helped us with directions, and gave us superior customer service! Our Room smelled great, was clean and bright. We had a full kitchen which saved us money on eating out while visiting. ALL of this for $47 on a Saturday night?!?! WOW! I even mentioned to my man that the lighting and the amount of mirrors in the room made getting ready to go out much easier for the both of us! The hotel is about 15min away from downtown Las Vegas, and there are restaurants and shopping centers located all around the Crestwood Suites. This would be a great place to stay if you don't have a lot of money, but appreciate kind welcoming service, and a clean simple stay! Thanks again to Robin and all the hotel staff! Chelsey & Eric</p><br>never check in before 3<p>first of all i went to check in at 1 o'clock on tuesday 10-23 and was told by a very rude desk clerk(clerk) that i couldn't check in until after 3. i asked if i can make reservation to assure i get a room and was told there's plenty of rooms available now but check in is not until 3. all while she was talking to me and even when i walked in she (kiara) was playing on her ipad and acted like i was being a bother to her. so i left and came back at 4 when another clerk was there (junise) and she was very helpful and polite. Junise gave me her full attention and helped out tremendously. all i'm saying is if you want good customer service then don't check in before 3. i'm still here and so far my visit is o.k.</p><br>Worst weekly suites in Las Vegas<p>This is the fourth and by far the worst of the weekly suites I have stayed at in Las Vegas this year. I am very upset, because I came here expecting this to be the better than the rest, as it was far more expensive than the others. In this case, higher price simply means the company is greedier than the others. Noisy, small cramped space. I wouldn't even call it a suite, it was just a small hotel room with a very loud refrigerator, two burner stove and a toaster. They claim they provide you with cooking and eating accessories. Turned out to be a single 2 quart pot and two plates, cups, and two pairs of eating utensils. Can't cook more than a pot of soup like this. Their "Hi-speed internet" never matched dial-up speeds in repeated tests with speedtest.net. Pool is a joke. Fitness center contains non-working equipment. Could it have been worse? Yeah, if they held me up at the front desk and simply stole my money, but the reality wasn't too much better than that. They'd have to pay me to stay here again.
Room Tip: Stay next door, at least they are cheaper and the rooms are much larger, more like an actual apartme...
See more room tips</p><br>Not worth it for me<p>I have started with a rating of 1 for some of the courteous staff and see if I can work up from that. Features I was looking for: location, queen beds, full kitchen, high speed wireless internet.

I specifically chose this place because of the kitchen. My plan was to make an average of 1.5 meals per day for our 7 day stay (myself, 2 daughters and their friend). After surveying the inventory (2 dinner plates, 2 bowls, 2 mugs, 2 drinking cups, 2 forks, 2 dinner knives, 1 teaspoon - food prep: 1 pot, 1 frypan (not teflon), 2 ladles, cutting board), I asked at the front desk for more. They said there wasn't anything else available and besides, that unit was "meant for 2 people, not 4". My reservation was made clearly stating 4 people, with full names, so I resented the implication. I explained that we had to take turns drinking tea and I did not have a knife to cut with. I walked away with a steak knife and some styro cups.

I ended up not making anything - anything I made would have needed a utensil that was not available.

High Speed Internet was slower that I remember dial-up being. Like watching grass grow.

I do not like daily housekeeping, however, there was NO housekeeping. If I needed new towels, I had to bring the old ones down to the lobby. After 4 days I asked for a light cleaning and I was told that I can get one after 7 days. I did manage to get a vacuuming for the next day.

Location is GREAT! We had a 7-11, McDonald's (FAST Wifi and $1 drinks, 24 hours), Outlet Mall, IHOP, Denny's moments away.

If Emerald Suites was available for my package I would have chosen that. If I had to do it over again, I would have booked accommodations separately.

I will up my rating to 2 for location.</p><br>Clean and Quite<p>This hotel was clean, quite, and reasonably priced. It is near the airport and the strip. The staff was friendly and courteous. The room had a fully size refrigerator and a two burner stove top, as well as, a microwave. Overall, I would recommend the hotel.</p><br>Crestwood Suites South Las Vegas<p>I have stayed at the Crestwood Suites on Las Vegas Blvd a few times.The location of hotel is GREAT!! It is about a 3min drive from the main strip!! Great shopping mall across the street along with many restaurants!! It is about a 5min drive from Airport! Free WiFi but it defiantly is not high speed its extremely slow!! Decent kitchen in room. Outdoor swimming pool,&24-hour laundry room....Clean, quite, good customer service! The rooms are nothing special just a regular room with basic accommodations! Great for business or family fun....
Room Tip: corner suites are much larger than most rooms!
