<html><head><h3>Siegel Suites Select – Las Vegas Boulevard Hotel Reviews Page 9</h3></head><body><br>Life Savers<p>I was in a bind, while on business in Las Vegas, NV, and I found Crestwood Suites to be a "Life Saver"! The rooms were clean and I found the small kitchen to help out tremendously. Location is perfect, near airport and across the street from Las Vegas outlets with affordable shopping, also right down the street from town square and the strip. Staff was extremely friendly and courteous, the service was prompt and if in any problems, just relay your issues to the front desk and they will do their best to work with you to resolve them, even if personal</p><br>Warm and kind staff - clean and welcoming rooms.<p>Upon entering the hotel lobby - I was impressed by how clean the hotel was and the very warm and friendly staff [ Ms. Dorothy & Autum].

They went out of their way to be accommodating [prices were off the hook - especially for the service and niceness of the accommodations]. The beds and pillows are very soft and welcoming and the maid service was and is always right on time.

I will always stay here on my visits to Vegas.</p><br>Great amenities at a gargain price<p>This was my second time staying at this hotel. I like havng all the nice amenities, such as full-size frig, stove, microwave oven, toaster, and even real plates, spoons, forks, mugs, etc. On top of that you get free wireless internet access! Having all that along with a bargain price makes it my choice.</p><br>Autum<p>Very nice.
Very attentive.
Makes me feel like a VIP!</p><br>Do you want a great value with exceptional service<p>Stumbled upon a diamond in the ruogh that is a "Suite" deal. Expecting a moderate place and received a wonderful experience. I highly recommend this place to one and all. The rooms are clean and comfortable minutes from the airport and strip.
SERVICE; The staff went out of their way to meet my ever need.
Thank You Autumn and Joseph.</p><br>What a great place to stay on a budget<p>We stayed at some good, some bad and some ugly........I have to say Crestwood Suites on Las VEgas Blvd is the 1st part of that. THE GOOD......Dot and her staff are doing it right! Regardless of what you need they will make it happen or try every way they can until it does. Autumn, Brenda, Lisa, and Theresa keep up the good work.......and Dot words cannot express what she does for guests beyond the call of DUTY! My family was ill during our stay and she and Brenda and Autumn made sure to see if we needed anything. YOU CANT GET BETTER THAN THAT! !
