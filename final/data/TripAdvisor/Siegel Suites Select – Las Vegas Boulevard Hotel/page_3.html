<html><head><h3>Siegel Suites Select – Las Vegas Boulevard Hotel Reviews Page 3</h3></head><body><br>Decent place for the money<p>Great Location if you need something by the airport. It is literally 2 blocks from the McCarran Airport Car Rental Center. It is in the same parking lot with a gas station (Rebel I believe) which is handy for grabbing water, soda, snacks, etc. not to mention gas. I felt like the area was safe enough, but being right on Las Vegas Blvd. and with a gas staion/conv. store right there, it does attract all types. Also, this place is right next to a nice outlet shopping center. The busy part of the strip is only a few minutes up Las Vegas Blvd.

The guy who checked me in was very friendly and helpful, and I could tell he made an effort to please. The place is essentially an inexpensive motel suites kind of place, but he acted like it was something more - which is a very positive trait. It became apparent to me between him and the few other staff members I interacted with that they take pride in the place and try very hard to please.

The elevator was fine - only a couple floors so although it was a little slow it wasn't bad at all. My room was a single bed mini-suite. I had a kitchenette with a full fridge, microwave, oven, sink, etc. I immediately stocked the fridge with tons of water and soda and it was very handy. It was a simple room. Seemed to be quite clean, to me. Shower was fine, water pressure was a little weak but I've had worse. I am vigilant about bugs (especially roaches) and did not see any nor any signs of any, and I looked hard. Also checked mattress for bed bugs and found nothing, no signs of them either.

Of course, I was attracted here by the low rate. The problem with inexpensive places is when they are not clean - but this place was clean enough for me and probably for most people. If you want nice sheets and towels and so forth, pay more to stay somewhere else. This was perfect for me, I just needed a night there to sleep after landing in Vegas that night and then heading to L.A. the next day. I was able to relax, bathe and sleep well, and even chill my beverages for the trip the next day.

They served coffee in the lobby and it was good - not great but not bad at all either, it was good. I paired that with a cinnamon roll from the gas station right there and it was a fine breakfast for me for that day.

I'd recommend this place for anyone who needs a place to crash for a night or two - but if you're visiting Vegas you should be able to find something better for a little more money. Still, I'd recommend this to just about anyone. It was a good stay for me.</p><br>Its what it is for the price an extended stay<p>The personal at the front desk had a great attitude. Housekeeping on the other hand are rood. It did have a little smell in the hallway but the all in all you get what you pay for and for the price we paid it was worth it. Safe place to stay and plenty of places to go to eat and shop. Yes I would stay here again, hopefully soon.</p><br>BEWARE of Cockroaches<p>We checked in on October 25th, 2013 for one night. Room looked clean, until I went in the washroom and found a cockroach. I picked it up with some tissue and brought it to the front desk. There was a young man there that said I was rude to bring that to the desk and to get it away from him. I was considerate enough to make sure there were no other customers there and was offended that not only did I have cockroaches in my room, but to be treated like that as well. The assistant manager then came out and asked what was going on. He checked our room, he found more cockroaches. He told us Las Vegas is full of cockroaches and that he would transfer us to another room. He would give us plastic bags to put our luggage in so they would not get into our personal belongings. I asked him where the closest hotel was and he said Vegas was booked up solid because of the Rodeo that was in town. He said because we booked our room through Travelocity that there was nothing he could do for us. Two hours later they booked that same room with the cockroaches to another traveller. I would like to hear from the Manager of this hotel. Never again will I consider this hotel. BEWARE!</p><br>Not Worth It!<p>I asked if I could have an early check-in being that I was relocating from another Extended Stay Hotel to this one and had perishable items, such as food that needed instant refrigeration. I arrived at noon on the 16th of September and was told by an operator (Kiara) that I would be able to check in within the hour. Of course, I was instantly being deceived because the room didnâ€™t become available until quarter to three. I was completely disgusted with the fact that I was being misled about the check in process and because of that misleading, my perishable items spoiled. I was confused about why the room was taking so long to be cleaned until I witnessed Housekeeping on break twice (once at 12, then again at 2pm). So I was instantly disgusted with the behavior/conduct of the staff at this location and was considering not even occupying a room. But I have been in Vegas for about two months so far and have lived at several different locations, so I was a little exhausted with the constant relocating. But I guess I should have stuck with my first intuition because the condition of the room I received was not able to compensate for the insidious waiting. I donâ€™t know where to begin because there were several issues with the room itself. First with, a smoke alarm is missing, stovetop vent screen is missing, and bathroom vent being detached/hanging. While I was doing my own cleansing of the room, I found several fixtures that werenâ€™t cleaned thoroughly, fridge had stains, top of fridge dusty, countertop had grease/grime, stovetop was greasy, refrigerator door had food stuck, and microwave was uncleansed with stains and crumbs, and bathroom toilet seat dirty. The couch had a stain, and underneath, the cloth had tears/rips with specks of trash. I also noticed the linen had some stains, and black specks of crumbs on the top sheet. I found a strand of hair on the bathroom linen towels, and I also noticed that the kitchen sink drain is corroded/rusted, and the bathroom sink pipe leaks as well as the overflow drainer doesnâ€™t work which I found out when the water overflowed. I also have an issue with the front door and the fact that it sticks, so itâ€™s a little difficult to shut completely. I have recorded footage of all of these inconsistencies that I found, but I am beyond words that all of these issues went unnoticed before the room was even rented
PUBLIC WIFI, no access code...I also didn't appreciate!</p><br>Not as bad as reviews suggest<p>After I had booked the Crestwood Suites, I read the reviews and so I travelled fearing the worst, So I was pleasantly surprised on checking in to find the very friendly Dylan on duty at reception. Over the course of our stay, this guy could not do enough for us. Indeed all of the staff was helpful and friendly but Dylan went the extra mile. The accommodation was adequate for what we needed and was clean and maintained well. Every room was being refurbished when we were there and this should make the rooms even better. For us the location was ideal as we wanted to see more than just the strip. Ideal for access to all the main freeways. Internet connection was not so good in the room but I had no problems sitting in reception catching up with news from the UK. Caesar s Palace it wasn't but then again I wasn't paying Caesar's Palace prices My only complaint was that the swimming pool was freezing cold, even in the 100 degree heat. If you go looking for faults, you will always find them, even in the best of hotels. Accept the Crestwood Suites for what it is, a moderately priced hotel and you should enjoy it. If I return to Vegas I'll use it again.</p><br>Internet wifi was terrible<p>We stayed at this Crestwood Suites in July 2013 for one week. The internet wifi signal in our room was usually 0 or 1 bar and basically didn't work the whole week we were there. The morning after we checked in we asked to be moved to a room with a better signal, but the woman at the front desk said she couldn't move us. A week later when we checked out the manager was there and checked us out. She asked how our stay was and I told her about the wifi problem. She said I should have come to the front desk the day after we checked in and asked to be moved. I told her I had done that and the woman standing 3 feet from her at that very moment wouldn't do it.</p><br>Average but so is the price<p>This place provides basic place to sleep in. Location is a little far from the Strip, a 8 minute car ride. But the price is basic also, so there should not be high expectation. Also, parking is right in front of your room, so that is a big plus after the miles and miles of walking in the LV hotels.</p><br>Dirty smelly place<p>I have never left a review, but felt people needed to be warned. The entire place smelled like stale cigarette and was filthy dirty. Gave me a constant headache and I smelled like I was in a old casino. Moreover, the elevator smelled like weed and stale smoke. Avoid this place!!!!</p><br>The worst<p>I would have walked right out, but stupidly it was paid for through travelocity. The room was infested with cockroaches, the "suite" was a small motel room, no table, no tissues,(we were told to use toilet paper) a double bed, and curtains with threads hanging. I am not finished, my next job is getting after Travelocity for paying $97 for this atrocity. I will never use Travelocity again, and certainly make a wide berth around the Crestwood Suites.
Room Tip: Do not pay for a room ahead of time.

Had to bring my infant and toddler in to speed the process up only to finally get up there and they had booked are rooms that were already taken. Giving us two seperate rooms across from each other which smelled like the smoking floor, I just wanted one if it was messed up but they said the refund will be a hassle. Got in the room, the carpets were nasty, bare feet turn black. The top cover felt sticky. Blood on the bathroom floor all dried up. Need I say more? The people that stay there are ghetto as hell. The elevator usually smells, if not weird then smokey from someone's joint. I stayed here before and I don't know why I didn't care last time especially when then the curtains in the room fell completely off the wall, and the carpets just as dirty. The price is ok... But you get what you pay for I guess. Never again. Only thing that kept me same was the Dunkin donuts across the way.</p><br></body></html>
