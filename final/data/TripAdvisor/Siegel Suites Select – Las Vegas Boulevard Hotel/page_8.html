This is where I will be staying the next time i go...</p><br>Safe, clean and very welcoming/accomodating of a large tour group.<p>We were very happy with the facilities, location, and friendly staff at this location. They were very accomodating and were always looking out for our group and their needs. We had a large tour group and this location was perfect for them. The location is in safe area and close to outlet shops and a large range of eateries. We will definitely be looking to use this location for our future tour groups.</p><br>A Good weekly residence with good location for your stay<p>Ms.Autumn is very friendly, I was asked to give a comment to this hotel. so I am doing this. a good location, a nice and convenient environment. will be back next time</p><br>Not Too Bad, Could Use Some Updating<p>Only stayed here since I used hotwire. Check in took longer than I would have liked and the front desk person apologized. Person who got there before me had his card denied and had to get another one which took awhile. Lots of stuff nearby which was good. Went to a concert and came back with not many parking spots, so couldn't park in front of the room overnight, no biggie. Full size fridge was great to have. Stayed in the smaller queen room which was fine for two people. Room didn't smell like cig smoke at all which I was relieved, Check in took longer than I would have liked and the front desk person apologized. Person who got there before me had his card denied and had to get another one which took awhile.</p><br>GREAT PLACE TO STAY<p>This is a great place to stay , the people are great ,its quiet and its close to the strip.i would refer anyone to crestwood suites.you get what you pay for and more......</p><br>Wasn't so bad<p>Sure the clientele may not be refined, but if you mind your own business, no one bothers you. We checked in around 7 PM. The staff was courteous and checkin was quick. The room was fine. What I'd expect for hotels similar to Extended Stay. No issues with noise or cigarette smell. I'm very particular about having non-smoking rooms. Didn't use the amenities provided, such as the fridge & kitchenette. I purchased this through priceline.com. It was a great deal being that we were staying on a Saturday night.
Located across from the outlet mall, McDonald's, gas stations (bit cheaper gas than elsewhere in the city), and very close to the airport car rental return.</p><br>Horrible!<p>When people give this hotel 3-5 stars it makes me wonder what kind of hotels they've been staying in! From the outside, this looks like a new, modern hotel. The staff at the desk was nice, but she was the only one there and it took forever to check in. We needed a room for three people and a small dog. The double rooms were all booked, so she offered us a one bedroom suite with a fold out couch. We went to our room and were stunned to find that the rooms were ancient. Not only that, but our "non-smoking" room smelled like years of cigarette smoking were covered up by some flowery perfume. We actually smelled of smoke just by staying in our room for 15 minutes. The kitchen area looked like something out of a 50's TV episode. Everything was old and worn. The beds had troughs down the middle and we kept rolling into each other all night. The air conditioner was right beside the bed (literally less than a foot away from my feet). The walls were paper thin and you could hear bits of conversation in the next rooms. The next morning we were awakened by a brawl between two women in the next room that spilled over into the hallway and parking lot. We were glad to get out.

All I can speculate is that they took an old, run down hotel and built a pretty facade around it. I won't stay in any of these hotels again. Right next door is Tahiti Vacation Resort. We got a room there for the same price by booking ahead on Orbitz. It was beautiful! Go there.</p><br>Crestwood Suites was great<p>I thought this place was clean, friendly, and convenient for travelling arround Vegas, wheather heading to Red Rock Canyon, Henderson, the Strip or shopping ( the Outlet Mall). The kitchenette is such a bonus when staying for extended periods of time. Last Oct. being our first time staying there, after staying at other hotel/motels in the past, we have decided this is the only place we are looking into from now on. Great value for such a budget price. The only negative piece of advise to offer is to be sure not to get the room next to the "resident" playing loud music all night. ( after realizing on the 2nd night this was going to happen again, they staff quickly switched us to another, better room).</p><br>I am sorry I could not stay longer<p>We had a short, but very relaxing stay, good price and location, quiet, clean, wifi, walking distance to get food or others, employees and specially Autum was very helpfull and nice with us.</p><br>Never again<p>We arrived at 4pm and the lady at the FrontDesk told us that the rooms are not yet ready and the check in time of 3pm doesn't mean that they have to provide the rooms by 3pm. Finally we got one room (booked two) at 4:30pm and another one around 7pm. If you want a hotel with stinking carpets, noisy flush and rude staff then this is the one for you.</p><br></body></html>
