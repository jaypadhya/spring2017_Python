<html><head><h3>Siegel Suites Select – Las Vegas Boulevard Hotel Reviews Page 10</h3></head><body><br>One of my faves in Vegas!! Crestwood Suites should be a BEST Value<p>For the amount you pay on average, you won't find a better place to stay. Although it's not a casino hotel, its close enough to everything and offers a very fair rate even on weekends. The rooms are comortable and the staff very friendly. I've stayed in almost all Vegas hotels, why stay for more and get less? That's why I stay here!</p><br>Stayed In Many 3 to 5 Stars Hotels/Casinos And That Is Just What They Were But Here They Make You Feel At Home!<p>Because of the 1st time when you walk through the door you are greeted not just with a smile "BUT AN AWESOME staff that really cares! But yet PROFESSIONALS!</p><br>Best Customer Service ever!<p>We stayed in a suite (hence the hotel's name) for the weekend only. We flew in and did not rent a car. Our flights were late in the afternoon on Monday and check out is at 11am so we had no place to hold our luggage (that we knew of) until our flight in the time between 11 and 5pm. So we asked the manager behind the counter if we could somehow old them there. She said that there wasn't enough room behind the counter so she held them in her own personal residence for us. That was just unbelievable. It made our last day in Las Vegas so stress free and fun! We are all so grateful for Dot's, and the rest of her team's commitment to customer service!</p><br>Dear God!<p>Do you like hashbrowns? Then check your bed because they come free in selected rooms. The showerhead EXPLODED, flooding the bathroom. As the water was flailing wildly, I found myself extremely irritated, especially when my flooded bathroom smelled and felt like it was like a steamy Costa Rican lagoon. I also found myself sharing a bed with someone since the hotel was OVERBOOKED for the 2 queen rooms. And the refrigerator? The motor purrs like a cat that was mangled in a John Deere tractor. The best had to be the smoke alarm that was chirping (Even with the battery disconnected). Not to mention, the location exposes you to massive amounts of traffic if you are trying to get to Henderson or The Strip. I highly regret not sleeping in the vacant scrub brush lot across the street. The vacant lot was likely quieter, drier, and friendlier than Dong the bellboy, who leisurely agreed to EVENTUALLY fix the smoke alarm. Oh, did I mention the rank smell? Trust me, the high humidity from all that water made it alot worse.</p><br>Lousy customer service<p>I stayed at the Crestwood for its price, easy and close access to Las Vegas Strip's attractions. When I checked in to get my "guaranteed 2 queen bed room", I was told there were none left and all I could have was a single queen and a pullout couch/bed. Well, I agreed to it thinking it can't be that bad and not wanting to look for another hotel on the fly. First off, when we got back at midnight, I found no sheets or pillows for the couch/bed. When I called the the front desk to ask for bedding, the lady on the other end said I would have to come down and get them, that she couldn't deliver them. Before I went down, I dicovered the pullout bed was broken and couldn't be slept on as it looked like a rollercoaster! The rather rude female night manager bellowed, "I can't give you another room" when I asked and wouldn't answer me when I asked if the hotel was full and she didn't seem to care when I said I would have to sleep on the floor because of the broken bed. To make matters worse, when I returned to my room, I found it impossible to put the bed back in the couch! So, my night included sleeping on the mattress on the floor underneath a semi folded bed jutting out of the couch. I was so disgusted I didn't even bother telling the manager the next morning but juts put the keys on the desk and told him I had a lousy night! I won't be back!</p><br>Ghastly<p>Stayed for 1 night in late August with my wife and an 11 year old daughter. Location was at a corner of two loud, busy avenues.

Worst stay ever. Iâ€™d like to give this place a minus five star, if possible.

The room was old. Appearance of a 70â€™s room. Cheap construction material used such as thin walls (I can hear people in the next room speaking and in the hallway walking & running), skimpy doors, light aluminum door knobs, plastic tiny bath units, loud A/C, low water pressure toilets, etc. The mattress was lumpy. The sofa area was about 4 feet by 5 feet and crowded with a fridge. One has to crane over to watch TV which was placed on a credenza in the â€˜bedroomâ€™ section.

It is not a suite as you would imagine staying at a Marriot Courtyard. The room was so small there was hardly any place to walk, let alone to put your suitcases.

In the hallway, there was a woman walking dressed like a prostitute with 3 inch high heels and fishnet leotard. I wouldnâ€™t be surprised if she was one.

The room reeked of cigarette smoke although I paid for a non-smoking room. It smelled so bad, after two weeks upon returning from my trip, my bedroom closet at home where I keep my suitcase, still smells of noxious cigarette fumes.

I asked the front desk staff to be transferred but was told the lodge was completely full. Her tone was, â€˜Just shut up and leave me alone. You can complain all you want but it wonâ€™t help.â€™

She promised to bring an air refreshner machine to the room. She never brought it. As I was checking out the following morning, she explained that she was busy and that it was my fault that I did not come to the front desk to pick it up.

Her boss was out and she was the only one working when checking out. She declined to give me her name. When I asked for her bossâ€™s name, she ignored me and told me to leave.

Perfect for you if you smoke, want a place to crash from 11pm till 5am and favor cheap dirty, loud place. There are many alternatives. No other place is worse than this dump.</p><br>Great location if you want to stay away from the strip<p>Great front-desk customer service! They allowed us to check-in early. The best part of the hotel is how near it is to the airport, outlet mall shopping, restaurants and the car rental return. This is also a great place to stay to save money because they have full kitchens, stove and full sized fridge included! The room is big, with comfortable beds and pillows, nice, strong Wi-Fi signal and large bathrooms. My biggest complaint - because I am a non-smoker - is how strong the smell of smoke is in the rooms even though we were in a non-smoking room. I think the smell is coming from the hallway (possibly from other smoking rooms) and comes in through the rather large gap between the floor and the door of our room. To remedy this - I got some towels from the bathroom and stuffed it under the door gap and the floor - wala! no more smoke smell. Also, a few but not all of the complaints that are mentioned about this hotel are petty and could be avoided if people are prepared and do their research first. My two cents - if you want a first class/five star experience - pay the money and stay at a first class/five star hotel.</p><br>OKAY . . . .<p>For the price it is another place to stay. It was clean - we got a smoking room and requested non-smoking and could not get it switched. It was quiet and off the beaten path. Would have preferred King size bed.</p><br>Very nice hotel<p>This is very good hotel:
1, Free WIFI,
2, Clean Hotel
3, Full size Refrigerator, Full size Stove, Micro-oven
4, Good price
5, Just 5 mins walk to Outlet Las Vegas</p><br>Great for the money<p>Just back from a fortnight at this place. No major cons (had to buy additional coathangers). If you want a clean, cheap place with cooking facilities, handy for shopping and Airport, then this is for you.
I paid around $55 a night for a two week stay

It isn't strictly in the heart of the action, but there's a strip bus available outside the door ( $2 per trip)</p><br></body></html>
