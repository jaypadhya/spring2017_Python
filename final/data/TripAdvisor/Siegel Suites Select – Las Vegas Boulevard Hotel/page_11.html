March 28-31, 2008
Our stay here did not start out very well, we made reservation through their website. We received a confirmations from them. When we arrived in Vegas they had no reservations for us, Even though we had a valid confirmation number. The internet number is different than their reservation number. We were told that we should have CONTACTED Crestwood Suites in Vegas direct to make sure they had a reservation for us. We have never had to do that in all our many reservations we have made on the internet. Then the discription of the room we reserved stated that it had a well-lit kitchen talbe/work area (HA), a comfortable well-lit living area (WHERE). We expected it to be like other suites we have stayed in. To our surprize we got a counter with 1 chair. The living room chair was in the way. They would have moved us latter but that woud have been a major chore. The room could be bearable if only one person was staying in it and you were in the room very little. We feel that their advertising is not true to what they offer. To get what we had thought we were getting you would have to reserve a Deluxe Suite. I could go on about other things, but will not. Bottom line is we will NOT STAY AT THIS PLACE ever again. Even though it is close to family and that is the only reason we go to Vegas.</p><br>Convenient for the price  H&amp; D -Tampa<p>If you are looking to pay the high price to stay on the strip with no room amenities such as a microwave, coffee pot, refrigerator then Crestwood Suites is not for you. It was wonderful to have the ability to cook, heat and refrigerate food on the spot without having to move our bodies and car everytime we wanted to eat. Management statting has changed in the last year for the positive and it is evident. Staff was friendly, I mentioned some of the negative reviews to the staff and they admitted that many of the negative comments about the property were true, but in the past 12 months new management has cleaned house. Great location to McCarran Airport . We were too pleased that the new McCarran Airport Rental center for "all rental cars" is literally 2 blocks away. Across the street is the Las Vegas Premium Outlet Mall with 2 food courts,100 stores with more coming ( construction underway). Also on the same grounds with the Outlet Mall are numerous name restaurants, fast food outlets, gas stations. Grocery store is about 2 blocks south of hotel-convenient to stock your room. Yes, the room lacks ambience and the furniture and carpet are due for a change, but it was clean, quaint and for $79.99 AAA rate per night, it was ample. This is very convenient to the strip. Just drive N on Las Vegas Blvd about 5 minutes.</p><br>Average, the strip is obviously nicer.<p>This place was decent enough. If you have a car with you then this place is a decent option because you can just drive to the strip and park at the big casino's for free. Its a bit south of the airport on the Las Vegas Blvd. I'm not sure if this is a Las Vegas thing or not but when the toilet is flushed it sounds like its going to rip itself right down through the floor. The whole room shook when it was flushed. I noticed something similar at the Luxor too. The front desk staff were fine.

Pros:
- Price
- Convenient location (with car)
- Clean
- Suite style room
- Password protected Wi-Fi

Cons:
- Strange smell of cleaner when you first enter the room
- Smaller room
- Super loud toilet</p><br>Not that bad for the price!<p>I stayed here with a friend one night and it wasn't as bad as some of these reviews make it sound. The staffing wasn't all that bad in my opinion. They did refuse to call a cab for us though which I thought was strange. The room was decent. It was clean. I didn't smell any bad odors like some of the reviews say. Overall, it was very average.</p><br>Don't Waste Your Money<p>ON 5/07 i arrived @ the hotel to check in and was flatly told 3pm is check in no earlier. When i was able to finally check in i asked for the top floor and was refused and told to check back later so i did around 5pm and the night person told me that there was nothing available on the 3rd floor and i asked has everyone checked in he said no because they have pre assigned the rooms. The room i was in for 7 nights because of work smelled actually the whole hotel smelled of smoke and there is no smoking in the halls. The next morning i asked the clerk to please call me a cab and said no we do not call cabs for people i then asked for a room clean and was told my room would be cleaned on a certain day of the week i had allready been there 3 nights so in the 7 night stay my room was on cleaned once and it was not cleaned until 6pm and when i asked why so late i was rudely told because they had 11 checkouts that day. When i looked to see what they cleaned it was nothing i also found dried BLOOD on the counter i called the front desk and was told clean it myself. On the 4th day i asked housekeeping for new towels and was told to get them from the front desk so i went down there and they told me to go back and bring the dirty ones down before i can get clean ones.
All in All the staff is very RUDE not friendly and could'nt care less about the guests at all and from what i saw its 1 big party for the staff they were allways on their cell phones or had friends that looked like they were in GANGS over, loud talking . housekeeping people had rap music turned up loud so that we had to turn the tv's up. It was a horrible stay. I WILL NEVER STAY HERE AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1</p><br>Loved It<p>My family and I stayed at the Crestwood Suites Las Vegas Boulevard from 24/03/2007-13/04/2007. The two bedroom suite was large,bright and clean. The staff were very friendly,helpful and willing to help you if help was needed (ie. get you clean towels in the middle of the night). We plan on visiting Las Vegas again next year and would definately stay at the Crestwood Suites Las Vegas Boulevard again. The Crestwood Suites are situated just south of the Mandalay Bay Hotel on the strip but within walking distance of restaurants,shops etc. I would definately recommend staying here to anyone visiting Las Vegas.</p><br>Horrid smell<p>The staff was not very friendly. Wanted some extra blankets and pillows and they absolutely refused to give us any.
Gave us a room that slept 4, although we told them we were 6.
Finally called back and said they could give us a room that sleeps 6 for an extra fee.
The smell was awful. We kept spraying the room with perfume just to help deal with the odor.</p><br>Ghetto<p>the Crestwood Suites on Las Vegas Blvd is a terrible place to be. As soon as you walk into the hotel lobby of the it reek an odor unimaginable, just sickening. Check-in is for 3:00pm and our room was still not ready when we arrived at 6:00. An hour later the room was finally ready. The room we ended up with was a smoking room. It was disgusting but we can live with that. What we couldn't live with was the mess left in the bathroom. The counter top had water marks which obviously meant it was not properly wiped down and the sink still had dirt on it. We tried to clean the sink but that didn't do us any good because the damn sink was clogged! There's only one explanation for why the sink looked the way it did, they simply didn't clean it. The bathroom floor was filthy, obviously it was not mopped and the carpet hasn't experienced a vacuum in decades. It's a known fact that hotel bed covers are not usually washed every time a guest checks-out. But if the cover starts to show stains and discoloration of unknown matters, it's a really good indication that it's time to give it a wash. We threw those things right off the bed and left it in the corner of the room. I have chills just thinking about it. I bet when we checked out those nasty bed covers were placed right back on the bed as if they were good as new. ICK!

In order to get fresh towels you have to trade in your used towels at the lobby. When I tried to trade our used towels for some fresh ones, they didn't have any fresh ones to give. Apparently, they were all still being washed. What kind of an establishment runs out of towels? Obviously, one that doesn't know what the hell they are doing. The receptionist said it could take up to 5 minutes to get new ones from the laundry room and she would bring them up to our room when they are ready. We waited nearly 30 minutes for new ones and still no towels. We decided to find the laundry room ourselves and finally got some towels. On our way back to our room we were stopped and interrogated by one of the employees about the towels we were carrying back to our room. They asked where we were going with them and where we got them. For crying out loud it's just towels. If I could wipe myself down with toilet paper after taking a shower I would just to avoid having gone through that kind of questioning in the hallway over towels.

Check-out time. There was a courtesy knock on the door to remind us that check-out is at 11:00. We acknowledged this and started to prepare ourselves for check out and ran a little behind schedule. An hour later there was banging on the door. This time the courtesy knock sounded more of a threat to get the hell out of there. The cleaning lady with the missing front teeth was irate and started to yell at us. Her demeanor was unprofessional and her tone was not pleasant. I could not believe she thought it was ok to talk to people let alone customers the way she did. She was nasty, she looked nasty and her attitude put her over the edge of the disgusting meter. Was it really that serious for her to act the way she did because we were a measly hour behind check-out time? Get a life, if not beg borrow and steal if you have to.

Overall the Crestwood Suites on Las Vegas Blvd. is the worse hotel we've ever stayed at. The room was extremely disgusting. The ambience needs serious remodeling and cleanliness is obviously not a priority. The employees were a joke and could use some serious training in customer service. Not only were the staff unprofessional but looked the part as well. What rat hole did they hire these people from? Unbelievably GHETTO!</p><br>Unexpected Surprise!!!<p>After a long day of sightseeing in Arizona, we arrived late on a Saturday night last May at the Hearthside on South Las Vegas Blvd - around
11:00pm. We were very tired and looking forward to getting our room. To our suprise, the front desk clerks were not happy to see us. I gave them
my reservation number that I received from Hotels.com. One of the clerks looked at her computer and said, "Nope, no record of your reservation (silence)." Both clerks gave us that look like we were pulling some type of scam, since most of the hotels that night were booked up. I
finally convienced them that we had a valid reservation, and they "relented" and gave us a room. "You're very lucky," the clerk said. The room was clean and somewhat modern with a complete kitchen. Nothing fancy, but enough for our needs. The next morning while trying to enjoy my
breakfast, I received a call at 10:00am from the front desk. The clerk told me that check out time was at 11:00am. Gee, I would have never had known. I was told this multiple times the night before at the front desk; it showed the check out time on the key card folder; and there was a nice big sign on the back of the front door that said, "CHECK OUT TIME IS AT 11:00AM." If you're looking for basic lodging at a reasonable price, check out the Hearthside. And if you're "lucky," you'll meet some of the unfriendly front desk clerks! "Vegas - What happens here - Is told all
over the world!"</p><br>Please don't stay here...you'll be sorry!<p>I stayed at the hearthside on flamingo rd in Las Vegas for two nights , the room was not clean at check-in time 3pm. It was just made to appear clean, The sheets had not been changed,and when I asked for clean ones I was told they were recylcing them,and there would not be clean ones till 9pm. when they came we had to make up our own beds,the bathroom floor was not clean there was no waste basket, or clean towels.Take my advice.....Please don't stay here...and you know like all of corparate America....they don't care about the customer,or we would'nt be pumping our own gas, scanning our grocercies...and now, doing our own maid work at the hotels we stay at they take us for a lot of sheep.</p><br></body></html>
