<html><head><h3>Siegel Suites Select – Las Vegas Boulevard Hotel Reviews Page 1</h3></head><body><br>Alonzo is the worst manager ever<p>Never in my life have I ever dealt with such a rude manager Alonso is the manager for this place and is actually the worst person I've ever dealt with in my life he is the reason we are not staying here anymore at the Siegel suites select and is definitely the reason we are leaving this horrible review he literally could not accommodate us in anyway shape or form and was very very rude</p><br>Worst place to stay In vegas<p>Reasons NOT to stay here:
Crime abundant
Bugs everywhere
Applyiances do not work
Drug use abundant
Babies crying
Paper thin walls
Violence
Ghetto
Bad neighborhood
Price changes every week
Unorthadoxed management and security

If you are here for business or with young children do not stay here a very loud unsafe stay.


Management is completley unorganized. Manager Theresa is obviously either a senior citizen unable to do daily functions or an uneducated individual. From a business point of view the staff does not communicate with eachother on pricing or guidelines. Seems like it is constantly changing. They even charge for room keys. They might say your stay here is 280 but if you want sheets it's 350. Some weeks even more than 500. Also security guard here is completley volgure and nosey. The other staff at the front clearly do not know how to use a computer because checking in or checking out is a constant baby sitting job trying to get them to understand anything.</p><br>Now Siegel suites select! <p>This place is actually really great it's just been renovated and turned into the Siegel suites select and we were the first people to stay in the new rooms they have flat screens and great air-conditioning and awesome weekly rates we would come back anytime</p><br>Want a challenge this is the property for you<p>This property definitely was a challenge. I understand that check in is 3pm, unless rooms are available earlier however I was not aware (and it had never been mentioned to me at any time during the booking process that this property does not hold bags or in fact does not allow guests to even sit in the reception area with you bags until check in.
Arrived at the hotel at 10am and was forced to sit outside the property, on the only seat which is located next to the smokers area (and butt disposal) for 5 hours & when I went back in at 3pm was forced to wait a further 30 minutes whilst staff personnel at check-in desk changed. This property has a swimming pool however staff would not allow me to use this facility (which had a locked gate at the entrance) as I was not a guest, I could not even sit near the pool which was cooler and smoke-free. There was a shopping centre located next door however I would have been forced to take my bags with me just to get a drink or something to eat or to even go to the toilet after a 20 hour journey from Australia this was my major challenge. I believe Reservations should be transparent and advise this information at time of booking to prospective guests.
Thankfully I was able to go to the Mall to buy food and drinks & go to the toilet whilst my husband sat with the bags and breathed in the cigarette and cigar smoke however if I had been travelling alone, I would have been forced to take my bags with me to go to the Mall to go to the toilet.
I certainly would not use this chain again.
Room Tip: lower floor on south sider are quieter

We somehow had a hard time finding the location though it's right off the street because there's no sign that we are already in Crestwood Suites. For some reason, during check-in I saw a lot of Siegel? Suites as the hotel name. Ruth told me they changed names just recently. Hmm, it would have been nice to announce that in the website. Anyway, the check-in process is a little lengthy given that we don't have records with them and there's a lot of security checks- just because they care ( I read this in one of the signs in the lobby haha). I think we got the value for the $56 that we paid for. The room we got which is on the ground floor is pretty decent to sleep in and spend the night after a long roadtrip from Arizona. Aside from this, there's nothing more to expect in this hotel. The internal is dated and furniture are worn out but since we're just spending a night we don't mind it at all. It is really basic. The reason for my very good rating is that the gas station, premium outlets and pretty much a lot of restaurants are right outside your door while the car rental facility is just 3 minutes away. It is a very convenient place to stay if you're just spending the night in Las Vegas to wait for your early morning flight the next day.</p><br>If you want to get the feel of living in a slum, this is the lodgings for you.<p>Pulling into Crestwood Suites to park, we were shocked to find the side of the building adorned with grafitti.
We parked, and then saw more graffiti on the property in several areas.
(See photos).
This was a very bad sign to us - if the property doesn't even care about the outside appearance, how bad is it on the inside?

Unfortunately we had a paid reservation, and they wouldn't let us cancel it at the desk.

Sure enough, everything about the property inside was bad as well.
The many previous negative reviews of this property and it's staff are accurate.

Example - I asked the young man at the desk "What are the hours that the Exercise Room is open?"

Desk - "What is your room number?"

Me - "You mean the hours that it's open depend on the room we're staying in???"

Desk - "No."

Me - "So what are the hours?"

Desk - "It depends on who is on the front desk".

What???
Makes no sense, but neither does anything else about this dump.


Never again!

This is a property to avoid - unless you would like the experience of knowing what it's like to stay in a slum building with grafitti everywhere.
Room Tip: Stay elsewhere
See more room tips</p><br>Room less than $50. I guess we got what we paid for<p>Forgot to book last night of our tour. Managed to organise a room near the Airport Car Rental place. Opposite the Mall.

Not the sort of place I would put my mother up in.

General culture of staff and guests was not really in our groove. Had a room opposite the cleaning staff room. Our room was ok for the money; bearing in mind the ridiculous over $20 resort fee paid on the strip.

Had a fridge, Hob, Microwave etc. Felt more comfortable if it had a safe! The bed was soggy and so was the pillows. Room was large enough.

Floor and bathroom was clean. Telephone had human hair on it and receiver was dirty. grimed in dirt in the grooves. Flashing messages we thought were for us. So had to pick up to hear the messages. They were dated July. 3 of them!

Unlikely to stay here again. Generally did not feel safe leaving electrical belongings in the room if going out.

The photographer deserves a prize for exaggerating the size of the pool
Room Tip: I think we were 133. If the staff read this comment, the telephone may have been cleaned time you ar...
See more room tips</p><br>Never Again<p>Proof that you get what you pay for! Upon arrival we stood in a thirty minute line to check in. There was one employee working and they seemed to be uninformed. The person in front of me had no reservations and got a room and the person behind me was given a room different from what they reserved because of hotel error. The third floor smelled like a pure ashtray.
The room was small, unclean and scary. One night I stayed up listening to a fight in the parking lot.
We came with our soccer club and there wasn't a single place to gather or that we wanted to gather. Many of the people in our group had issues with service, cleanliness and were extremely frustrated. Never Again!</p><br>Saved our day!!<p>We moved here in Vegas from California and we were looking for a place to stay for 5 weeks while our house is being constructed.We walked in here desperate for a room after having a horrible experience on a close by budget suite that we thought was an "emerald".Considering we came here the day after thanksgiving and being a holiday and friday night we were surprised that they have a room for $40/night.Brandon, the receptionist was so accomodating even let us check the room before we complete our reservation!!This place is 100x better!! Very clean rooms, kitchenette, strong water pressure even have a wifi and flat screen tv!! The location is perfect as it is right next to the outlet mall!! Plenty of parking and just a few minutes from the strip!! We are still here and being thankful everyday that we found this place.Would definitely recommend this place to family and friends!!!!</p><br>Clean, basic accommodations with a kitchenette<p>No frills budget room off the strip with a queen sized bed, big bright bathroom and a kitchenette. Everything was clean, we had room to move around and the coffee maker, microwave, refrigerator and toaster worked. Plus we were able to stay an extra night for less than we paid for the first night.</p><br></body></html>
