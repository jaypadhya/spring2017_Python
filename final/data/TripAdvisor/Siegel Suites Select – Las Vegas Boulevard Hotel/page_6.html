<html><head><h3>Siegel Suites Select – Las Vegas Boulevard Hotel Reviews Page 6</h3></head><body><br>This place is disgusting!<p>Our reservation couldn't be found, and when they finally assigned us a room, we walked into an occupied room, then they moved us into another room that was filthy, all the sheets were yellow as well as the pillows, the bed has pieces of roach wings and legs, the carpet was stained n damaged, we got moved into yet ANOTHER room with a dirty kitchen with coffee stains on the table, trash from the previous occupants still in the room and hairs on the pillows, the plugs on the wall were unsecure, the bathroom had no towels, all the kitchenette was sticky, I felt nauseous but had no choice but to spend the night due to my prepaid reservation and inability to find a replacement hotel at such short notice, I felt paranoid and to make matters worse, guess who has a pair of arms covered in bed bug bites? That's right, me....this place is not a good look, not to mention the next door neighbor looked like a crack prostitute and couldn't walk without holding on to the wall....I was absolutely grossed out by this place</p><br>Not for the business traveler!<p>As soon as I checked in I knew I should have spent the extra $ to book the next flight home and leave this dump behind.

- The staff was unfriendly, unhelpful and unempathic - no room changes even though the reservation was screwed up (I booked for two beds, non-smoking, and received a small/smoking room next to the generator room with one bed - no rollaway or even enough space for one of us to sleep on the floor. Think sleeping with a total stranger - and you get the idea...we had decided to share expenses but had only met via the internet - thankfully my unmet friend decided to spend the night in the casinos instead)

- A LOUD verbal fight between two men broke out in the courtyard under my window around 10:00 pm - the staff was unresponsive and let it go on for over an hour).

- The room was small - and not really very clean.

- The Internet service was down (there was a sign in the lobby stating such that looked like it had been there so long it was collecting dust). No estimated date as to when it would be fixed. If being connected to the Internet is vital to your work call before reserving

- NO SHUTTLE service to the airport. Staff called a cab which took over an hour to arrive.

- During my hour in the lobby another customer came up to the counter to ask for a clean sheet, a few minutes later she returned with the sheet she had given. This new clean sheet she had been handed had been thrown up on.

If you are a business traveler and there is any way to squeeze more out of your expenses DO NOT stay at this Crestwood.</p><br>DIRTY!<p>Ugh! Beware this place looks nice on the website and not too bad from the outside, but the furniture and rooms are disgusting, broken, and dirty. We left after 1 night and stayed at the Homewood Suites MUCH NICER and not much more money.</p><br>Not for Families!<p>Went to Vegas to visit grandkids. Went with my husband & teenage son. I refused to keep my young grandchildren because of the "in & out" clientelle of the hotel. I had booked a 3 night stay through a 3rd party, and canceled after 1 night. Heavy traffic in the room above us ALL NIGHT! Uncomfortable, broke-down furniture. Creepy feeling. The only good thing was the desk clerk that checked us in. She was very kind.</p><br>Close to fun times &amp; cheap<p>awesome for price, uten sf ils for kitchen stove full size fridge</p><br>Well, it was a good Price for Friday in LV. But other than that.....<p>To make a long story short, I just needed 1 relatively inexpensive night in Las Vegas and I found it on-line for the Crestwood Suites, about $ 50 for a Friday night.

The front desk woman was pleasant, but the room was dated, the furnishings were pretty plain, the room was small for a suite, and the walls were paper thin.

So if you need a cheap place to stay, go for it. I would definitely NOT take my family, it just seemed a teensy bit seedy.

One plus is that is walking distance from the off-site Rental Car place. I walked over to that on Saturday morning and got my rental car.</p><br>Has great potential, but needs work!<p>Chose this hotel for price and location. Upon checking in at the designated time we were told there were no clean rooms available. Waited thirty minutes before we finally were given a room. Staff was unfriendly, and seemed to be doing more than one job at once. We were not the only ones checking at that time and other guests were told they would have to wait for a clean room. Once we got to our room, we found cigarette butts on the floor, disconnected smoke alarm with exposed wires, no coffee/sweetner, etc, Twice during our stay hotel staff walked in to our room unannounced claiming the door was open. The rooms are set up nice with a kitchen/microwave, etc and the place has great potential, but it seems there is lack of proper management and staff.</p><br>a little worn but good value<p>A pretty basic hotel and reasonably priced. My room had a kitchenette, but nothing to cook with. Bed was comfortable, bathroom was clean. No continental breakfast or coffee. Slightly noisy in the halls at night, but hey, itâ€™s LV.
SLOW free wireless. No business center.
Too far from the strip to walk so youâ€™ll need a car or taxi. No airport shuttle. Really easy access to the airport. Very near fast food and a big outlet mall.
A decent budget choice if you want to be a little way away from the strip.</p><br>Stay away from this dump<p>First of all I would like to say that I was not having big expectations for this place â€“ it is a 2 star hotel for $50/night that I bought through Hotwire â€“ I only wanted it to be clean to spend a night. Well it was not AT ALL. First is when you come into the lobby it smells of dirty feet!!!! The elevator is dirty and smells. There was a huge dead cockroach on the floor of the bathroom and the bathroom floor was dirty with hair and dirt on the floor. All the towels had dirty stains on them, all of them. The pillow cases had dirty stains on them as well. It was clear that someone slept of them before and they were not washed. We had to sleep in our hoodies and without pillows.
I am not a winy person â€“ we have stayed in 2 star hotels prior to this one on this trip â€“ and all of them were much better than that.
I do not recommend this dirty hotel to anyone. There are plenty of same priced hotels that are on top of that much closer to the Strip.</p><br>BEST HOTEL WITH QUALITY MANAGEMENT<p>I stayed in the hotel for a week, Its the best hotel with quality management. Price is reasonable and Manager and staff are really caring. The beauty of this hotel is that they have kitchen with utilities. All these facilities at a very reasonable price.

I had a good time staying in this hotel. I would definitely recommend this hotel and rating for this is 5/5</p><br></body></html>
