<html><head><h3>Siegel Suites Select – Las Vegas Boulevard Hotel Reviews Page 2</h3></head><body><br>Exactly what we wanted<p>We were after accommodation slightly away from the action but within easy reach. Also, this was classed as a long stay as it was for 28 nights and was eligible for a good discount. We hired a two bed, lounge, kitchen and bathroom apartment and cooked all of our own food of choice, thus avoiding the fast food trap that most holiday makers find them selves in. If your going to visit Vegas, google their number and see what deal you can agree to. We got the whole apartment for $80 per night and there were four of us staying.
We will stay again soon. Thanks Crestwood..See you again soon.</p><br>It's a bed and a room nothing more.<p>It's a bed and a room nothing more. The amenities are simple. Restroom, fridge , stove, bed, tv, drawers. Noggin spectacular and all over used and abused. My bed was horribly worn out it felt as though a 500 lb person stayed in the same position in the center of the bed for 6 months straight. The place was completely booked so I did not attempt to get my room changed. So I stayed out as long as I could so that when I got back I would be soo tired I would think about anything. But in the morning my back reminded me of my decision.</p><br>donÂ´t go there<p>I picked this place because I came late and needed something close to the Las Vegas Car rental station, but you better drive 10 min longer. bad place, horrible room, never again. The kid at the reception was the only good thing I can mention.

Room Tip: no good room in this Hotel
See more room tips</p><br>Great Value, South of the Strip, right by Outlet Mall South<p>Read a lot of reviews on here before staying here, but some people are shocking, we liked the place, close enough to the strip to get a cab in for about $20, the rooms were big and had everything needed, staff at check in were helpful, plenty of parking, and the people staying here were friendly. Would definitely stay again, and if you like the shopping the Outlet Mall south is across the road. Has good WiFi This is not a luxury hotel as I think some people expect, but you get what you pay and I think this was great value for money and location.</p><br>Pretty good, nice staff<p>Staff was friendly, hotel was a little dated but the full kitchen made up for it. The outlet stores and restaurants across the street made things convenient, as well as the bus stop across the street that takes you to the strip!</p><br>I was more than happy here<p>I stayed for a week and a half here in March and must say was very impressed.For someone who has already been to Las Vegas its great.For a first holiday visit its a bit out of the way although you can get to the strip easily by bus in minutes.I found it very handy for the airport and for car hire places nearby.You have a great shopping centre and eating places all over the road.My room was quite basic but perfectly adequate.I had a view of the carwash and it was nice to see dirty cars all coming out looking spick and span.I had the swimming pool all to myself.I found it nice and peaceful after all the buzz of the strip.
I found the reception staff amazingly helpful.They would print off directions to places and even give you instructions by bus etc.There was a small gym which I didnt use but it looked fine.It does seem to be geared up more for long termers but was fine for me.I got cheap daily 24 bus tickets and went all over the place.I am not a big boxing fan but went to Floyd Mayweathers gym and saw him training and spoke to him afterwards.As I have been to Vegas many times I only bothered to go to the strip once to visit new hotels there but outside there is tons to see and visit.
Room Tip: The corridoors are quite long so try to get one near reception although there are several doors to g...
See more room tips</p><br>ONE OF THE BEST VALUES IN LAS VEGAS<p>Clean, spacious, 2 bedrooms, 3 flatscreen TV sets, fully equipped kitchen and all of this for under $60? Yes, that is true. We were really surprised when we checked in and saw what we got for the bucks. Is it luxurious? no.. Is it incredibly worth the price? Yes.</p><br>Great alternative for a budget trip to vegas<p>The room was large, the bed was quite comfortable. There was a nice little kitchen and huge bathtub. I read previous reviews and I was a little concerned but decided we would risk it as we were just driving thru to Vegas and wanted to check out Vegas on our way thru. Its about 3 minutes from the main strip so very convenient and right across the street from a factory outlet mall
The only bad I can say is that when we asked for a cart to take our bags down the looooooong hallway, they were less than helpful and the maid left a used coffee pod in the coffeemaker
Room Tip: ask for one close to the elevator or you could be walking 1/2 mile to your room
See more room tips</p><br>Horror Show<p>I recently stayed at this location with my daughter and this place was a total dump. There was no daily cleaning service. There were cigarette burns in our drapes. Our couch was ripped. Our room was filthy. At night, when I moved the nightstand to plug in my phone, there was a tampon behind the nightstand. It was in a poor location with very sketchy clientele. During the night and day, there were scary people just hanging out in the back parking lot. This is not a safe place for kids. Run, don't walk, away from this place.</p><br>Save Money and Enjoy Vegas<p>I recently stayed at Crestwood Suites when I visited Vegas for a wedding. I saved money staying at Crestwood while enjoying their quaint room, which included a full kitchen + dishes and complementary in room coffee. When in Vegas, you are never in your hotel room--why pay to stay on the strip when you can cab there? The staff (who are so friendly and accommodating) provided me with a local cab service which arrived within 5 minutes. All of my friends stayed on the strip (complaining about overpricing, the crowds, and still needing to cab around to the clubs since they were in heels) while I was a cheap cab ride down the road on Las Vegas Blvd. S. which took me directly to the club saving time and more money,

Not only is the hotel very cute, it is also near everything you need-- whole foods, ihop, and the outlet mall is across the street. VERY convenient for every shopping need.

Additionally, I left my jacket in the room after check out. The staff aided me in acquiring a shipping label and FedExed my package instantly after I emailed the request.

I really could not be happier with my stay. I saved money staying at a very nice hotel--this is going to be my go to place every time I visit Vegas!!</p><br></body></html>
