I chose to stay at the Skylofts because the photos online and the amenities included with your stay (Maybach limo transport). I am an extremely picky traveler who expects alot depending upon my purpose of travel. Since I was celebrating my birthday I had specific requests so that I would enjoy myself. Seven of my closest friends were flying in so the Skyloft concierge team had to plan out a small dinner party for seven and limo pickups and nightclub VIP seatings etc. From the very beginning the hotel did not miss a beat. The customer service was absolutely outstanding. When I got to the airport there was a young lady waiting at the gate to greet me. We arrive at the hotel in an MGM grand limo that was refreshed with Fiji bottled water. Upon arrival we had the no waiting approach we accessed a private elevator right to the room I was staying in. When I got to the room the check in process began. The room is supplied with butlers and maids round the clock. The butler gave us a tour, and the room was more than I expected. Extremely contemporary and very sexy. This was the first time Ive seen a shower with see through walls so others in the room could see you take your shower. There is an ipod hookup on the main level to which you can control your ipod via remote. And the music can be heard (surround sound speakers in every room) throughout the loft, very sexy. This is not mention in advertisment. The butler set up for my party and the table was georgous. the food was outstanding!!! Compliments to the chef. My Bday cake was a beautifully decorated chocolate that was magnificent. Overall the room was spotless (that means no dust and no scuff marks on the floor or walls and of course general cleanliness beds and baths)!!! The fridge come fully stocked with complimentary beverages (incl Voss water-sparkling and still). I could go on.... But I can not do my experience justice....check out the hidden gem on the roof of the MGM Grand Hotel for yourself you won't regret it!

some concerns: At check two of my friends were there she could have been more decrete about how much the room cost etc. and the maids and butler have access all day so you never really know when they will enter the loft. Had to renew key at least three times. cont. to get demagnitized</p><br>Absolutely FABulous!!!<p>I have stayed at many luxurious hotels and the SKYLOFTS was absolutely the best one!!! My friends and I decided to live it up and stay at the best place in Vegas and we booked a loft for the weekend and we were absolutely blown away! First of all, our check-in process was very personal and walking through the doors and seeing the views was breathtaking. The furnishings was hip and luxurious, we had our own personal butler to help us with whatever we needed...What a treat! Next time I am going with my fiance....</p><br>Didn't live up to expectations<p>We stayed at Skylofts for a few nights nights recently. We had high expectations considering the very positive reviews it has received to date, but our experience was a little disappointing.
We can concur that the rooms are luxuriously appointed and spacious and our experience was not negative, however, we had some issues with Skylofts, which are not acceptable for the price we paid for staying at Skylofts, including:

- the minibar includes water and softdrinks which are complimentary. We made a small request for the minibar to include orange juice which, although agreed to, never turned up.

- we noted that we wanted to go to the grand canyon and the concierge booked a helicopter tour for us and told us that the tour would take approximately 7 hours. We booked for one day, but at the last minute the tour was cancelled. So we re-booked the tour for the following day, which meant that we had to cancel our special plans that we had made for dinner that night because, based on what we were told, we would not get back in time from the tour. The tour in fact lasted only 2.5 hours, therefore we need not have cancelled our plans. We wondered how the concierge could have got it so wrong.

- Skylofts provide a limosuine transfer to and from the airport (a 5 minute journey). Upon checking out, we were told to simply arrive at the designated meeting point at a certain time and all would be taken care of. We arrived at the designated meeting point but it was not a seemless service. Our luggage was nowhere to be found and we had to wait 20 mins for it to be collected and needed to constantly remind staff that we were still waiting.

- We found the service to be a bit too "full on". Each time we walked out of our room or through reception, an army of people were greeting us and asking us if we needed help and offering us different services. Check in alone required us to liaise with at least 6 different staff members (all of which required a tip). In such a high end hotel, we would prefer a little more privacy and for service to be delivered in a subtle and seemless fashion. We found the constant interaction with staff a little uncomfortable and unnecesarry.

However, having said this, we did enjoy staying at Skylofts and there were some highlights such as a generous amount of chocolate strawberries on arrival, petit fours provided with the turn down service and efficient servicing of the room, but we expected a lot more for the price we paid.</p><br>heaven is a place on earth... called skylofts<p>From the moment you make your reservation, you know you are in for a treat. I had read quite a few reviews prior to booking and was still blown away by the magnificent level of service that they extend to all their guests. After booking online, I received an email from Valerie who thanked us for booking and invited me to call or email for restaurant reservations, show tickets etc. I called Valerie and requested restaurant bookings both at the MGM hotel (Craftsteak = Delicious) and at other restaurants where I did not believe that they took reservations. Guess they do for the skylofts as our 7:30pm table was ready & waiting. Wanted to see Kai (great show btw if you have seen O) and got preferred seating. I also requested a strip view room & received it despite arriving 5 hours earlier than the 3pm check in time.

On arrival at the airport, we were greeted at the gate by a lovely skyloft Representative who escorted us to the luggage carousal. We were taken outside and the renowned Maybach62 pulled up to the delight of my two daughters who did not know where we were staying in Vegas. On arrival at the MGM, the concierge & bellman were waiting. We were escorted passed the check in desks, through a VIP room to the two separate elevators. Up on the 29th floor, they have two desks with people to assist you with any reservations you may have forgotten to pre arrange. The lobby do have drinks served during certain times but we did not indulge during our stay.
We were escorted down the hallway and could see Art, the butler, standing at the door of the loft. Check-in is in the room at the dining room table while the bellman takes your bags upstairs to the bedroom and you sip your welcome juice. I had a two bedroom suite which I booked based on previous reviewers and was so very glad I spend the extra amount as the master bathroom is to die for. After check in Art showed us around the loft which has all the latest electronics which work at a touch of button along with drapes, climate & lights. Loved the day, night & mood lighting around the loft. Ladies, if you normally take an hour to get ready to go out, expect to take two hours when you stay in the skylofts. The large shower doubles as a steam room with bench. I put cleanser on my face and did a steam for 30mins. Don't do that as I got a rash. The infinity tub has the lights & champagne bubbles and faces the flat screen tv. The tv in the mirror is fun. The gown and slippers are comfy. The heated towel rack another great addition as is the walk in closet. The Bvlgari body wash, shampoo & conditioner are another treat.
The upstairs bedrooms are large with wonderful bedding and soft beds. Downstairs, we had two lounges, a media room with card table & dining room. Turn down service is the best I have ever encountered anywhere. The rooms are cleaned and used items replaced. They even arranged all my cosmetics in the bathroom on white cloths with product names facing up & in order of use. Cool bottled water next to the bed and a small gift + flower on the bed with a card. After leaving the "do not disturb" on until noon, we switched to make up room and by the time we walked to the end of the hallway, someone was waiting from housekeeping to refresh our room. Complimentary water, soda's, newspapers, internet & inroom movies. You can also request a laptop, video games & DVD's. In Room breakfast was served by Art and was hot & delicious. You have to request toast as it is not on the inroom dining card. Requested and received a later check out until 3pm.
Check out was quick as was the transfer to the waiting Maybach62. The skylofts charm is in the staff. The courteous, charming interaction with everyone was much appreciated. Many reviewers have remarked on the tipping. I did tip but never felt that anyone was waiting for it. Keep checking the mgm skylofts website calendar to see when the prices suit you and treat yourself and love ones to the best hotel in Vegas. The memories will last until your next visit.</p><br>Luxury<p>Wonderful property. The best amenities in a room that I have found available. Would not stay anywhere else in Vegas.</p><br>Beautiful<p>What can I say....The MGM grand hotel has everything there, you dont need to go anywhere :o)

All of the restaurants there are awesome (Diegos was yummy!)

The rooms are beautiful and service is impeccable. Everyone needs to stay at The Skylofts.</p><br>Speechless<p>The SKYLOFT is....there are no words to describe how GREAT this hotel is to their guests; (if you are trying to plan a surprise they do know how to keep secrets). My fiancée plan this trip for US and everyone but me knew about his secret proposal. The staff is great they are always there when you need something, if they do not have it they will go downstairs to get what you want. You do not have to lift your figure for nothing. If you need help planning a special occasion tell them what you want and how you want it and they will do the rest for you. I could not ask for a better place to stay. This place is worth every penny. You will truly feel like VIP!!!</p><br>Fantastic Experience<p>My boyfriend had stayed at SKYLOFTS numerous times during business trips, but this was my first time both to Skylofts and to Las Vegas.

We had a two-bedroom loft and from the moment we stepped off the plane the magic started happening. From a gate greet at the airport to the Maybach that ferried us to the front doors of the MGM, to stepping into an impeccable set of rooms, it was something else. I've stayed at some very nice hotels in the past, but this one far surpassed any expectations I had! It is comfortably furnished with gleaming table surfaces, impeccable decorations and starched, snow-white sheets on the beds.

Of course, the real bonus of Skylofts is the incredible service that comes with it. There was generally a butler hovering around somewhere, picking things up or checking on our welfare, and things were always picked up and taken care of. If we needed something, the butler or concierge took our request and it was fulfilled within moments. Show tickets? Dinner reservations? Transport to a club or other casino? You name it, and it was done FAST.

The little extras that come with the loft are, too, a big bonus. The infinity tubs in the bathrooms, TVs all over the place, sound systems that pipe over the entire loft, and excellent room sound insulation all only added to the experience. What fun to watch a movie while soaking in one of the most fantastic bathtubs I've ever sat in! In my world, it doesn't get much better. :)

There were a few things that could be improved upon. The air conditioning is not the best, though, to be fair, I like my rooms icy cold (67 degrees or lower). Also, I'm something of a bed snob and like soft, cushy beds, and the Skylofts beds are rather firm. I never had trouble falling asleep or anything like that, but I would have much preferred a plushier surface to sink in to! However, those things are all small when compared with the grandeur and service that SKYLOFTS offers.</p><br>Great Hotel!<p>The Skylofts are the best place to stay at in Vegas especially for first timers. What they offer has been already mentioned in the previous reviews, it is all true, The service is excellent, you won't need anything while staying there, they simply are excellent in catering to all your needs, we have been placed on the VIP lists for the night clubs we had visited, we saved hours of waiting in line and boy these lines are long! Thank you to all the employees of the Skylofts you really made my vacation in Vegas a special one. One more thing, the MGM is a great hotel, honestly it is one of the best hotels i have been to in Vegas, it compares with all the other high end hotels out there.</p><br>Blown Away<p>We were visiting Las Vegas for the 5th time this year and our first stay at the Skylofts. We were there for 4 nights and the service was spectacular. We have already booked our next trip and would reccomend this hotel for everyone.</p><br></body></html>
