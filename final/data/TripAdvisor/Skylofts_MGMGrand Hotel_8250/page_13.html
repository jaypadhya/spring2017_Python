<html><head><h3>Skylofts at MGM Grand Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 13</h3></head><body><br>Great experience!!<p>Everything about my stay here was perfect. This really is worth the money! Going back again this year.
The service is amazing but the views are incredible. Be sure to ask for a view of the strip rather than the airport. They accommodated all the requests I had.</p><br>Still a Five-Star Property<p>Just returned from a stay at Skylofts. As mentioned previously, the men and women who work at this hotel are friendly and professional, and really make the time at Skylofts special. Some very minor changes since my last visit: Voss water no longer stocked in fridge...Fiji is now the water of choice. Certainly not a big deal at all. Another change is the rainshower in the bathroom has had an alteration in water pressure. I am guessing that they had to install a water flow device because a guest probably left a shower running and caused a flood, so the water pressure is noticeably less. The night-time snacks are still dropped off but not what they used to be and less of them. My butt is too large as is, so certainly not a deal-breaker.

Special recognition to Pre-arrival coordinator Noe, Concierge Sherman and Igor the butler.

I am anticipating my next visit to Skylofts and would strongly recommend this property to anyone looking for a top-notch experience.
Room Tip: All rooms have great soundproofing. The A/C in the June climate labored a bit to keep the upstairs...

The service is exceptional and the staff extremely professional. The loft is large and comfortable with an incredibly comfortable bed. I had the pleasure of eating breakfast at the Mansion a few times. The service and the food were outstanding. I can't wait to stay here again, I highly recommend the Skylofts.</p><br>Vegas<p>I visit Vegas once a month, Skylofts has the best service period....the staff is the best in vegas and you will never find a bathroom that compares..my favorite hotel period..you get the best rate through American Express Fine Hotels and Resorts program
Room Tip: 91 & 92 are the largest 1 bedrooms.
See more room tips</p><br>Luxury at it's best!!<p>I highly recommend the Skylofts at MGM Grand for several reasons. The Skylofts at MGM Grand have the most exceptional service. From the moment you get out of your car you are greeted by a valet attendant who helps get your luggage loaded onto a cart and valets your car at the front door. The entire stay you are treated with outstanding room service and concierges service. I would recommend the Skylofts to anybody looking for a luxury stay while in Las Vegas. Beautiful lofts that are both contemporary yet cozy and they serve fantastic food!</p><br>Phenomenal Experience!<p>We recently completed a two-night stay at the Skylofts. Our trip was a combination of business and pleasure, but the emphasis was on the latter. I booked our room through the American Express Fine Hotels program, which entitled us to a 15 percent discount off the prevailing rate, a view upgrade at check in (if available), a $100 spa credit, a daily breakfast credit, Noon check in (if available) and a 4:00 PM late checkout time, in addition to all the standard Skylofts benefits.

Our first two nights in Vegas were spent at Mandarin Oriental hotel, so the limo picked us up there around 11:00 AM on a Sunday. A Rolls Royce was not available and we were picked up by a “regular” stretch limo. We had hoped to take advantage of the potential Noon check in, but we were notified upon arrival that our loft would likely not be ready until 2:30-3:00 PM. Given the previous night was a Saturday, this was certainly understandable.

Blake, the arrival concierge, offered to let us hang out in the MGM Grand VIP lounge until we could check into our loft. Unfortunately my wife wasn’t feeling well (terrible nausea) from a long night out the previous night that ended with a nightmare of a ride back to the Mandarin in a town car, and it was going to be tortuous on her to sit in that room for three hours. After thinking about an alternative plan for a bit, I called Mandarin to see if our room was still available since we were technically entitled to a 4:00 PM checkout. They were gracious enough to allow us to return to our room and Blake offered to have the same limo driver take us back, which we accepted.

My wife was able to take a two hour nap and felt like a new woman once she woke up. So much so that she had a craving for pizza and we headed to Wolfgang Puck’s restaurant in Crystals to satisfy that desire. While eating there Blake called my cell to notify us that our loft was now ready and offered to send another limo to pick us up from the hotel. This time we were pleasantly surprised to see the Rolls Royce waiting for us in the valet area of Mandarin as we came off the elevator from the City Center bridge.

After a short but enjoyable ride back to Skylofts we were again greeted by Blake, who was happy to see my wife was feeling much better. He walked us through the casino up the Skyloft elevators and we began our walk down the hall to loft 67. While walking down the hall, Blake told us due to availability they were able to upgrade us to a two bedroom loft, which is substantially bigger than the one bedroom we had booked. Just before entering loft 67 he received word through his earpiece that we had actually been assigned loft 83, which is a two bedroom with a strip view. Score!

So he “apologized” for the mixup and we turned around to head back towards the other hallway. Of course, this was no inconvenience for us and we were ecstatic to not only get the upgrade to a two bedroom loft but also a strip view. Prior to arriving my wife had no idea what the Skylofts were and no clue what we were about to walk into. We’ve stayed in some impressive suites in Vegas and other cities, but nothing like this 3,000 square foot loft. Needless to say she was “wide eyed” as we walked in and blown away by both the size and the quality of the room.

Blake completed the check in process in the loft and went over the various benefits we would receive as part of the Fine Hotels program. After finalizing the paperwork he handed things off to our initial butler, whose name escapes me. She gave us a tour of the loft and went over how everything works from the coffee machine to the remote controls to the bathtub to the shower, etc... She also told us all the various tasks the butlers are available to provide and we took advantage of many of them.

Once we were alone in the loft my wife was speechless. She not only loved the room and all the furnishings but was also blown away by the level of service and attention of the Skylofts team. We then began exploring the loft to get a sense of how best to take advantage of everything.

That night we had dinner reservations at Yellowtail, a great sushi place at Bellagio. The restaurant has limited seating on the patio overlooking the fountains and we were fortunate enough to receive one of those tables with minimal wait. We had a great meal there with an even better view. We initially had a table reserved at The Bank but my wife wasn’t quite ready for more partying, so we canceled those plans and headed back to the Skylofts for the night.

We initially thought the Skylofts bed was going to be a bit too firm for our liking but found it to be very comfortable after settling in. We both slept extremely well and each liked the fact that there is a heavy black curtain that can be closed to cover the blackout shades. In our room at Mandarin, it seemed like the lights of the strip always found a way into the room even with the blackout shades down. There was no such issue at Skylofts because of the extra curtain.

The next morning we had 10:00 AM breakfast reservations at the Mansion. My wife had never heard of the Mansion, so she again had no idea what kind of treat was in store. We made our way to the concierge desk and they immediately contacted a butler to escort us to the Mansion. He was very entertaining and told us some great stories on the way there.

Upon arriving we were seated “outside” even though it’s really inside in perfect 72 degrees temperature. We were the only guests dining there and received impeccable service from the staff. I ordered fresh squeezed orange juice, pancakes, bacon and a blueberry muffin. My wife ordered fresh squeezed apple juice, French toast, and bacon. Both of us loved not only the food but the overall experience at the Mansion. We only saw one set of guests the entire meal and they were just walking through with a staff member.

We were then met by our butler who escorted us back to the Skylofts. While walking back we mentioned to him that we were celebrating our 17th anniversary. Shortly after dropping us off in our loft, he returned with chocolate covered strawberries and a small bottle of Veuve champagne! This was a great touch and we enjoyed both the champagne and the strawberries that night after eating an in-loft meal. I ordered a filet from Craftsteak, and macaroni and cheese from Wolfgang Puck. My wife ordered her meal from Fiamma, an Italian restaurant, and a caesar salad from Craftsteak. We ate while watching game 7 of the Miami-Indiana series playing on every TV in the loft. No matter where I walked I didn’t miss any of the action, although it turned out to be a blowout.

Our meal was excellent and it was so nice to be able to eat in the loft on our last night in town. By that point we were exhausted, so it was relaxing to not have to go anywhere. We then ordered breakfast for 7:30 AM delivery the next morning since our flight left at 9:30 AM. It was delivered promptly and was excellent. This time I had the French Toast and my wife had an omelet.

After breakfast we headed down to catch our limo to the airport. Unfortunately a Rolls Royce was not available, so we had to “settle” for a ride in an Escalade limo. We made it to the airport right on time and had a smooth flight back to Charlotte.

The only downside to our stay at the Skylofts is we could only stay two nights. They spoiled us from beginning to end and we would have loved to have been able extend our stay. Unfortunately that wasn’t possible and had to make our way back to reality. We will DEFINITELY return to the Skylofts in the future and can’t wait to do so!</p><br>Another Great Stay!<p>Came here for our 1st anniversary after having an amazing time during our first visit after our wedding last year. We have decided to make this an annual event, so Skylofts Concierges: we'll see you in a year!

This time we got the 2 bedroom and brought along some friends and family who were also celebrating (law school graduations, etc). Noelani was our prearrival coordinator this time and did a fantastic job with making reservations and ensuring that all of our plans were confirmed and promptly sent us an updated itinerary whenever changes were made.

We arrived with a friend, so sadly we didn't get to ride in the ghost this time (2 people may be the max for the ghosts). The gold limo was fine, not too bad as what others have described in their reviews.

We had two other friends who arrived earlier and got to ride the ghost. It was very easy to arrange separate pickups from the airport; thanks again to Noelani.

We were greeted by concierge Blake at the Skylobby (a separate entrance to the right of the mgm entrance. You can also bypass the normal cab line of mgm and have the skylofts concierge get the next cab for you. This is a great benefit especially when the lines are 20 to 30 minutes long at night) who led us up to our loft. As we walked by the main mgm lobby and saw the 40 minute line to get checked in, it made us thankful that skylofts checkin happens as soon as you get into your loft and takes about two minutes. That by itself is impressive, as we always saw a line for the regular mgm rooms!

We met our friends who were there before us and all of them were already loving the loft! My husband and I enjoyed just watching their first experience with the loft.

They had a butler ready for us and the doorman (also very friendly, blond, young guy, didn't get his name though) who met us at Skylobby took our luggage up to our room for us. Blake quickly got us checked in and the butler served us some delicious welcome juice.

They have options for newspapers in the morning if anyone is interested.

We booked with FHR through Amex Platinum which is such an awesome benefit: about 15% discount off of the room, upgrade to strip view if available upon arrival, $100 spa credit, daily continental breakfast per room or breakfast at the Mansion, early checkin at noon if available, and guaranteed late check out at 4pm.

Got the strip view which was awesome! Didnt get the pool table or even a fooseball table but it didn't matter too much. If given a choice, I would much rather have the nice view rather than a game table. Where the pool table usually is, there were more couches and a table with a chess board on it.

We had different butlers that helped us throughout our stay and they were awesome! Whoever set up breakfast in the morning was terrific. They cleaned our stuff on the table and once they finished setting up breakfast, they gave us a wake up call (we were still all fast asleep, but I made sure to get breakfast at 9 am so we all wouldn't sleep the day away). This was probably my favorite FHR benefit; the last thing you want to do in Vegas after waking up is deciding where to get food and how far you wanted to go for it. With the comp continental breakfast, you can order it the night before or in the morning and the butler rings everything and sets it up on the dining table for you.

The butler that helped press 5 complimentary items was fast and efficient and delivered the items back to our loft at the right time. (Didn't get her name, but I saw her again with other pressed items so she may be the main "pressing" butler ).

We had booked tickets through the concierge for Le Reve and they picked up the tickets for us and had them ready with the concierge before we were leaving. Very convenient so we didn't have to wait in a will call line.

Definitely used the spa credit which was amazing like last time at the Grand Spa.

The boys did a sun buggy experience which we had set up for us too. Had dinners at CUT and Olives. Great seat at CUT. Didn't get the fountain view seats at Olives as requested though, but not skylofts' fault. Olives service was not great... More on that in the Olives review...

Maids did an excellent job cleaning up and setting up our nightstands and beds. LOVE that they always turn my chaotic pile of cosmetics and toiletries into an organized layout by the sink. We always appreciate that detail in customer service. Loved the treats left for us when we returned at night.

We enjoyed the complimentary sodas and voss water as always and thanks again to Noelani for having our sodas of choice stocked in our fridge :)

Steam shower and infinity tub were incredibly relaxing as always.

The dream butler fulfilled all of our pillow needs :). Note: the dream butler is not 24/7. I think they must leave around midnight or so. We tried ordering pillows at 1245am but they called back and said that the dream butler was gone for the night and the pillows are all locked up. We just put in our order early the next day and got them.

Check out was a breeze too. Just make sure to print out your bill and go over EVERYTHING. Other reviews are right when they say to do this because not all the credits are applied. Some charges are listed under a general name so be sure to ask what the charge is for if you are unsure before confirming that all the charges are correct. Last time they forgot the dining and spa credits, and this time was the same. It wasn't too much of a hassle. You just let them know what it should be, and then they go confirm it in some other room and then they come back with a new bill.

Also make sure to look at what the final charges are as the butlers go back into the room to see if you've eaten or drank anything that wasn't free and they will charge it to you after you leave.

Note for skylofts: loft 87 has a broken speaker above the sinks in the master bath.

Thank you for another nice stay and also for the congratulatory cake and champagne; it was a very nice touch. Looking forward to next year!

See more room tips</p><br>Opulent, but service fell a little short<p>We stayed here to celebrate my birthday. The guests staying here have their own check-in area. They seemed to really take a sincere interest in ensuring that your every wish is met. The butler took us up through a reception area that was only for skyloft residents and then when we reached the floor, we were in room 92 which was right next to the reception are on the floor.

The butler opened the door to our suite and we were immediately awed by the remarkable view! The butler showed us how all the gadgets worked from the iPad for controlling the tv, music, the temperature control, etc. When we went up to the second floor, again we were awed by the view from the second floor! The king size bed with sitting area was perfect. He was showing us how to operate the jacuzzi tub. He noticed that the drain plug wasn't in position. He was struggling with it for a couple of minutes and finally got it situated. (Kind of broke the mood.) The suite had a large walk-in shower/steam room. The bathroom vanity mirror has the built in TV and you control the music/sound/lighting from the control panel in the bathroom. The walk-in closet is incredibly spacious with a safe.

As the butler was leaving he asked if we were interested in dining in our room, since there is a dining room table for 8 in the room. We told him that we had reservations for 6pm and would much rather have the food served in the room. We figured that the atmosphere would be better and private.

As we were dressing for dinner, my husband tried operating the tv in the bedroom so he could watch the Montreal Canadiens game. Try as we could, we could not get the sound to stay on. We called the conceirge and they told us that a maintenance guy would be sent up. So while we were getting ready, the technician was swapping iPads from upstairs to downstairs and determined that the codes were not working on our system. He said that it would take 24 hours to reset the codes in the room! You would think that this problem didn't just come up. People watch tv in the morning or night to catch up on news or sports. Very disappointing. We figured out that we could have the tv in the bedroom on and turn the tv in the bathroom on the same channel and turn the volume up so you could hear it in the bedroom. Not ideal since it was really loud in the bathroom.

We had guests come to our party. They were really impressed with the room. They wanted a tour so we took them on a tour of the suite. We did not have a balcony. Would have liked one, but this room doesn't come with one.

The butler came in and took our order. Dinner was perfect. The food was amazing. We were waiting for our dessert, and had to call the conceirge twice. We found out that our butler was absent because he was with another set of guests. Real disappointment. We got another butler and she was nice, but we didn't get the service we expected. When you are told you have a personal butler, you never imagine that you will have to wait and then get a substitute. If you wait in a restaurant, you are not surprised for longer waits when they are busy.

We loved the view of the room, but we didn't have the best experienced that we could have.
Room Tip: Room 92 does not have a balcony. Great view!
See more room tips</p><br>5 Diamond all the way<p>We stay at the skylofts almost every weekend. At a minimum twice a month. The lofts are fabulously decorated. Open and airy, with a New York loft inspired style. The staff is incredible. From the Skyloft Valet, to the doormen, to the Conceirge, to the butlers............ an incredible collection of some of the most delightful people you will ever meet. They are so gracious and definitely respond to make certain your every desire is met. They always take time to stop and chat with us, and more importantly, with my 6 year old son. They all know his name, they always have a little treat in store for him, and he is always spoken to with such respect and caring. They really are the best. We recommend this venue to everyone!
Room Tip: Loft 28 is our favorite!
See more room tips</p><br>Living like a top 5%-er<p>I enjoyed quite a pampered stay here recently, my first at the Skylofts. For non-high-rollers like myself, a Skyloft stay is never cheap; nightly rates always run over $600 for a one bedroom. Rates vary hugely based on what's going on in Vegas and also on the day of the week; at peak times, rates run well into the 4-figures. I chose the dates of my Sunday-Tuesday stay based on the lowest rates available, and received additional concessions with a private website flash sale. The "Indulge in Luxury" package included a $100 spa credit and daily $50 in-loft dining credit. I was surprised the rates were low during my stay, considering it was Spring Break for many and also NCAA Basketball March Madness was in full swing. The stay was great--huge loft, highly personal service, many perks--living like a top 5%-er. The top 1%-ers and gambling sharks stay in the even more exclusive Mansion villas, which cannot even be reserved through normal avenues.

I have stayed within the MGM complex only once before, and that was in its West Wing. I've been around long enough to remember when this MGM did not exist--the original MGM was what is now Bally's, and I remember there being a huge fire there. I also remember this MGM having an amusement park behind it on the land that now houses the pool complex, convention centre and MGM Signature towers. The original pool area was where the Mansion complex now sits. Like all of Vegas, the MGM continues to evolve--most recently, the Lion Habitat has closed and will become part of the multistory nightclub/restaurant Hakkasan.

The Skyloft experience begins shortly after you book. You are contacted by a Pre-Arrival Coordinator who can assist you in personalizing your stay--arranging airport transfers, securing preferred seating at any MGM restaurant or event/production, etc. My requests were pretty simple, and my coordinator David handled them, through several conversations and emails, quite efficiently and courteously. I had requested a reservation at the Michelin-starred, hard-to-get Joel Robuchon restaurant, another at Nobhill, breakfast at the Mansion (which I had read about in other TA reviews), and a spa appointment. Nobhill restaurant closed around the time of my visit, but all other plans were a go.

The Skyloft airport transfer service is an indulgent way to begin and end your stay. I don't know what kind of welcome a guest gets if they arrive by car, but it probably can't top being greeted at baggage claim by a driver carrying and iPad with your name on it who then takes your bags and escorts you to a waiting Rolls Royce Ghost for the 5 min. ride to the hotel. Pick-up in the Rolls is not guaranteed--it's based on availability, the number of people in your party, and how much luggage you have--but my driver said the hotel has 6 Ghosts plus some Cadillac Escalade SUV's. At the MGM motor court, there is a separate lane and entrance for Skylofters. A doorman (Ambassador), bellman, and concierge greet you and escort you into the discrete and intimate Skylobby. From here, the concierge escorts you out into the hotel's main check-in area for the masses, through a portion of the casino into the VIP Lounge, which Skylofts guests have access to, and then to 2 VIP/Skyloft elevators, separated from the other high-floor elevators by unlocked opaque glass doors. Skyloft level access requires your key card. Up to the 29th (top) floor you go. You exit into the Skylounge, where 2 concierges are always on duty, and where evening cocktails and hors d'oeuvres are served. Lofts, of which there are about 58, extend down 4 corridors. About half have some sort of Strip view. The concierge escorts you to your loft, completes check-in there, and introduces you to your butler, who offers you a welcome beverage (in my case, a delicious blend of cantaloupe and orange juices with a touch of vanilla) and then gives you a tour of your loft and explains how to use all the pretty high-tech gizmos, of which there are many. A bowl of fruit and box of popcorn were on the dining table.

My one bedroom loft had close to 1500 square feet and would have made a decent sized apartment had there been a full kitchen. Lofts were designed by Taiwan-born, New York-raised Tony Chi, who has designed many a hotel and restaurant. The ground floor of the loft featured a large tile-floored entryway with a powder room and video screen on the door to view your incoming guests, a carpeted living room with a 2-story ceiling, a dining area with a table for 6 plus a wet bar and minibar, and an office area with an all-in-one fax/colour printer/copier.
The loft's upper level had the bedroom with one glass wall overlooking the living room and its 2-story windows, plus the huge bathroom with its immersion chamber shower (big enough to hold 6 people, with a rainhead, hand-held head, and 4 horizontal heads, plus a switch to turn it all into a steam room), infinity-edge spa tub with "champagne bubbles" (not a jacuzzi) and mood lighting, double sinks with TV in the mirror, enclosed WC, and a very large walk-in closet with hardwood floors that also could fit 6 people. Other loft amenities: free waters and sodas in the minibar, espresso machine with free coffee or tea, 2 wall-mounted Bang and Olufsen DVD/CD players with a library available, Dream and Spa butlers available to make up your bed or bath, an iPod home dock to pipe your music throughout the loft, and an elabourate Crestron remote control the size of an iPad (but thicker and heavier) that controls everything from light, drapes, room temperature, in-demand movies (free), TV, music, etc. The telephones do not have extensions for room service, housekeeping etc.--you simply dial the 0 and the concierge who answers takes care of everything.

With such amenities, it's very easy to cocoon yourself in your loft, but the MGM complex is gargantuan in size with many ways to spend your money, not the least of which is gambling.
My in-loft dining experiences were both delicious and high-end--for instance, the little jars of jams at breakfast were imported from France. Be sure to stow away any unfinished food you want to save for later--a croissant, for instance--otherwise your butler will clear it all away while you're out. They also cleared away my unfinished welcome beverage, fruit and popcorn, but all were replaced with a phone call.

The dinner at Joel Robuchon was expectedly pricey but fabulous. The restaurant had not received my request (made through David) for a table in the Terrace room, but we were able to be accommodated there. The butter service, bread cart, cheese cart and mignardises cart are over the top!

Breakfast at the Mansion also was wonderful. To preface, the Mansion is an exclusive gated area in the northeast corner of the MGM complex reserved for high-rolling gambling sharks. It is designed like an 18th century Italian villa, with large individual villas overlooking a glass-covered atrium courtyard or another outdoor courtyard which has a pool. The 2 Joel Robuchon restaurants are considered to be on Mansion property; there is also a separate casino, spa, and dining room. The complex can be seen from above from certain MGM and SKyloft rooms, as well as from the adjacent Showcase Mall (where the M&M Shop is).
Skylofters are made to feel we should be eternally grateful for even being allowed to walk in the Mansion's hallowed halls, let alone dine amongst its billionaire glitterati clientele, to breath its rarefied air. One enters the Mansion through a gated hallway just past the Mansion casino. A security guard checks you in and monitors your every movement. With the amount of planning it took for David to secure a breakfast spot, one would think the Dining Room was very busy. In fact, only one other table was occupied during my time there. The Dining Room has both indoor and "outdoor" seating areas--the "outdoors" being under the glass-domed atrium--but these are the more scenic tables. The space is undeniably beautiful. Breakfast, which includes both Western and Asian options, and is decidedly upscale. Prices are not exorbitant, but what one would expect from a high-end hotel eatery. Something to try.

Skylofters do not have their own spa, and must go to the MGM Grand Spa and Health Club for services. The place is huge. The hallway of treatment rooms is almost as long as a room corridor upstairs. The locker rooms also are large and busy. People can buy day passes for the spa and fitness centre. The relaxation area where you wait for your therapist to call you, typically a quiet, dimly lit area with soothing spa music, had a big screen TV and was very close to the huge hot tub with all its associated noises. I'm surprised there weren't any slot machines. The treatment itself was okay, but the whole experience was like getting a spa treatment in the middle of a subway station. Plus, the spa called me the morning of my treatment, asking me to reschedule because a therapist had called in.

Even though I did not request it, the concierge was able to indulge me with late check-out, so I went straight from the loft to the waiting Rolls to the airport. Check-out involves no paperwork. Everything just appears on your credit card statement. I would recommend you request a copy of your charges from the concierge to peruse--my statement had several errors both in my favour and otherwise, but the end result was reasonably accurate. Several days after my stay, however, a large 4-figure charge appeared on my credit card statement, and I had to resolve this issue by phone. It was taken care of satisfactorily, otherwise my TA rating would have been different.

Lastly, some minor niggles. The split-level lofts proved to be both a blessing and a curse. A blessing for quiet--upstairs was much quieter than downstairs, where you hear a lot of doors banging (especially if you are close to the butler's area) and music from the corridor. A curse because I found myself going up and down the stairs retrieving things, especially when packing to check-out. Also, the stairs are hard to see in the dark.
The black lacquer dining table shows every little smudge--housekeeping must curse their existence.
The towels, while having a lovely filigree motif, are not particularly fluffy or absorbent.
The location of the safe on the floor in the closet was not ideal.
Changing the hardly-used soaps for new ones at each housekeeping visit is admirable but wasteful, unless they are being re-purposed somehow.
As mentioned before, sometimes butlers and housekeeping are too efficient.
Some TA reviews have mentioned how staff sometimes enter your loft very quickly after ringing the bell. This was true at times for me as well, but understandable, considering how difficult it can be to hear the doorbell from upstairs, and the staff can't wait for an unreasonable amount of time. I suppose just try to be dressed, at least when downstairs.
The comments from Skyloft management to TA reviews seem to be done in auto-pilot mode, quickly and without much personalization, the opposite of Skyloft service.

Overall, a very enjoyable stay. I certainly would stay here again, especially if I were flying in. I would be curious to see how other hotels-within-hotels such as the Aria Sky Suites and Tower Suites at the Wynn and Encore would compare to the Skylofts.</p><br></body></html>
