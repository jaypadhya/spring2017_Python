<html><head><h3>Skylofts at MGM Grand Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 25</h3></head><body><br>Amazing!<p>These ultra luxurious penthouse lofts were amazing! They have someone waiting right outside the airport gate to greet you and escort you to your private limo. The limo then drives you directly to the MGM Grand where you are greeted by your personal concierge. She then takes you to the private elevators that go to the 29th floor where all the Skylofts are. Check in is done in the privacy of your loft where you are greeted by your personal butler that takes care of your every whim, including unpacking your bags (although I chose to do this myself, we did take advantage of the pressing services). The butler immediately stocked the fridge with the beverages of our choice, showed us how to work the espresso machine and gave us a full tour of the loft and how the remote system works. Everything in the loft is controlled by remote - lights, tv, radio, climate and drapes. The butler checks on you 4 times a day and is available by phone whenever you need anything. The housekeeping staff keeps your bathroom stocked with the basic Bvlgari amenities and anything else you could possibly need (toothbrush, razor, shaving gel, after shave, cologne, mouthwash, everything). The first night I was there I developed a blister on my foot from my new shoes. The housekeeping staff rushed two Band-Aids up to the loft. The docking station wasn’t accepting our ipod, so 2 IT guys were there within minutes to diagnose and fix the issue. I couldn’t figure out how to get hot water out of the espresso machine to make tea, the butler was there in a flash to save the day! The concierge coordinated all the services including all reservations and help from the other staff members. When we asked concierge how to get to Craftsteak where we had dinner reservations, they wouldn’t think of giving us directions. Instead, they escorted us to the restaurant and explained our tardiness to the hostess where we were immediately seated with a smile. We understand that the night before, the Obama’s and Clintons dined there. We ordered from their summer menu which included wonderful selections that gave you a taste of the chefs favorite items, including deep sea scallops, sautéed shitake mushrooms, kobe steak, quail etc.) We had so much food left over, we asked if it would be at all possible to box it up. We were told that the butler would take care of everything. The next day we called the butler for our leftovers and he heated the food and brought it to our loft, set it up on our dining table and it was more than enough for the both of us.

We saw a super fun show called Crazy Horse Paris. It’s based on the original Crazy Horse in Paris and is a burlesque type of show with wonderfully ballet trained dancers. Very entertaining.

On our final day, we decided to eat breakfast at the mansion. These are the rooms that start at $5000 a night and are reserved solely for the high rollers and celebrities. The mansion restaurant is reserved solely for the residents of the mansion but privileges are given to Skyloft residents as well, but you have to be escorted by your butler. We made 8:30 reservations, sat on the patio overlooking the beautiful courtyard and we dined alone as no one else was in the restaurant but us. The patio is enclosed by a dome and is temperature controlled to 70 degrees.

We would highly recommend the Skylofts for anyone wanting to be pampered.</p><br>Great vacation but somethings off<p>My 3rd visit to the Skylofts and I already booked my 4th visit. I have noticed a difference though. The difference is the extra touch here and there. The air conditioning was at best bad. My last 2 visits I never had that problem. The non cleaning up of dishes more then once a day. Fruit tray not left durring the day anymore. Only non alcoholic beverages in the fridge are complimentary. I don't drink so to me its the difference in policy. They still leave a little something at night though. There is a subtle difference and not for the better. I do believe its because of the drop in price. 1 bedroom going for $500 per and 2 bedroom starting at $700. When you start to see things like this the quality goes down. The rooms are getting worn and dirty. Most of these dirty areas are the couch areas in the den area of the suite. I get the 2 bedroom for the bathrooms. The tubs are great but are not working at full strength. The first 2 visits I dealt with my Butler on everything in the room but not this time. I saw him 1 time at the first meeting and gave him $100 and didn't see him again. The room service was done by a regular server you get in any room. The dishes were picked up only after a call was made. I don't like having a butler up my butt but this 3rd time I did see the difference he makes. I always came back to a clean room and he made sure things got done. This time I had to make calls. I gave out over $1000 in tips durring my first day from the car service to maids so it wasn't from a lack of tipping. Actually everyone always stopped us to talk. This trip just lacked that next step of quality you expect when you stay at the skylofts. I did book my next visit to the skylofts but I will be looking for my next penthouse suite if things don't go back to normal. If the next visit is my last it was a nice run. Nothing lasts forever. Something new always comes around. I hope you have a great vacation. Even the skylofts can have an off week.</p><br>Over the top fun<p>I stayed here with my boyfriend to celebrate our 3rd anniversary, and we both absolutely loved it. What made Skylofts different for me was the combination of service and over the top technology / ammenities. Do you need a television in your bathroom mirror so that you can watch Friends while your brush your teeth? Probably not, but it was fun to have that, and many other little things that made you say 'wow'.

The service was fantastic, again, in keeping with that over-the-top vibe. Example - if you pass a maid or concierge in the hallway they will step to one side and stand smiling in place until you have exited the hallway. It starts to look like the Queen is coming if there happen to be multiple staff members out who all line up! I found everyone to be warm, friendly, and personable.

The little touches were nice as well - a special surprise cake when we arrived to celebrate our anniversary, a different treat every night (warm pastries one night, a CD of relaxing music turned on the next, etc.) They really went out of their way to make it a special experience.

My one note on things that could stand an upgrade would be the pools and possibly the fitness center. I say possibly because as far as I know there wasn't one in the Skylofts, but I didn't specifically call to ask. If there was one we weren't aware of it - the MGM center is available but at a daily fee. My boyfriend and I had a blast at the pools but they are on the wild side with many people and kids. I believe I heard that Skylofts is currently building a pool for guests.

Overall, though, those thoughts are extremely minor in relation to my overall experience. Expensive, but for what you get, we thought it was well worth it!</p><br>Loved it!!<p>Our son surprised us with a night at the Sky Lofts on a recent trip to Las Vegas. We stayed in a 2 bedroom room and were wowed with every aspect of the experience, the luxurious linens adorned with a fresh flower, outrageous bathrooms with zero edge tub and steam shower, Expresso machine, extraordinary service and on and on. The most luxurious suite we have ever had the opportunity to relax in. Great views of New York New York and a scrumptious dinner at Craft Steak made it an unforgettable experience! We have told many of our friends and family about Sky Lofts</p><br>Simply Magical!!<p>We stayed at the Skylofts in a 2 bedroom suite and I have to say it was worth every penny. I was with my husband, our two older children, ages 9 & 7, and my 25 yr old niece. It was very spacious and the view was great. The bathrooms are to dye for with the soaking tubs and steam shower. My kids also loved the pool table in the suite and the electonics and flat screen TVs kept them busy. I counted 9 TVs in the suite (much more than is needed).
One of the best things was the butler and concierge service. We could get menus from all the restaurants at MGM and have everything delivered and set up in our suite!!! (which is great with young children), no reservations!!!!
The pool area was also wonderful. We rented a cabana for the day and let the kids play on the lazy river all day while my niece and I relaxed and were waited on.
I would love to go back if I can get a reservation!!!!!</p><br>Nice hotel room<p>We stayed at the MGM Skylofts on July 5th -8th.
It was definitely the NICEST hotel that I've ever had the pleasure to stay in.
Our pre-arrival concierge, Valerie Rubenstein, was an absolute delight to work with!! She arranged our pick up from the Hilton Grand Vacations in the Maybach (this was awesome, especially Frankie!) We were met by Aldene Silva. We were able to deal with her several other times and she was also a wonderful person!! I do not remember the names of all the concierge's or butlers that we encountered. But, I do know that each one treated me wonderfully. I felt like a VIP, even though I am not.
We were there to celebrate our 28th anniversary.
All the plans were executed to perfection, with a special surprise!! I attached a picture of the anniversary cake that was waiting for us that evening.
The loft does have a lot of fun features. I LOVED the closet!! For the first time I felt I had plenty of room for all my "stuff".
I found the television in the bathroom mirror quite fun, too.
The peephole on the front door was one of my favorite features.
You touched a button and you could see right outside your door.

The weather was extremely warm while we were there. And, our bedroom and bathroom upstairs was VERY WARM. We kept the blackout drapes and the curtains closed. They did bring up fans for us, though. I did not choose to leave because of the people.
I have never felt so genuinely welcomed in my life!

If you have a special occasion or just want to splurge...I highly recommend the Skylofts. The room is beyond words, the people are exceptional and the experience for us was magical.

I fell in love with Las Vegas and the Skylofts.</p><br>Beyond Words...<p>We found the Skylofts to be very luxurious and spacious. After reading all of the wonderful reviews however I was a little disappointed in the service. The real problem is the lack of continuity with the staff. We stayed for 5 nights and we never saw the same staff member twice. That goes for maids butlers and concierge. The hotel also needs it's own exclusive pool as the MGM pools are terribly overrun with children. The complimentary entry to the Wet Republic ultra pool was great but this is not a very relaxing space with the crowds and the loud music. The general MGM pools were over crowded and noisy. At least the guests staying at the signature properties had their own exclusive pools. Alas no such luck for a relaxing quiet swim while staying at the Skylofts. The room was great. Loved all of the televisions and the overfowing baths and the B & O sound system and the ipod dock and the central remote controls. The bed and linen were great. All in all a good but not great stay at the Skylofts. I would definitely recommend it especially if you are up for a party or travelling in a group. Just don't read the previous reviews and pump this place up in your mind to be something that it is not. I was left a little disappointed...</p><br>Top Notch<p>After reading all the other reviews, you simply dont believe any place can live up to the hype of the skylofts...well it did...yes its pricey, but worth every penny...as the one reviewer stated previously if you are staying at some place even close to the price of the skyloft and not staying here you are nuts...

Here is just part of my letter to our contact at the skylofts, to tell them what I fine experience I had:

"The Skyloft itself was amazing, but it was the people working there that really made it special. I have never been in any establishment of any kind in my life where customer service was so completely taken care of. I honestly cant think of anything I would change about my hotel experience. I have been to various high end hotels the world over, and whatever brand name you can think of, but the Skylofts stands in a world apart. Saying the Skylofts is better than these other hotels is an insult to the Skylofts because your hotel is on such a completely different plane...

I wish I could somehow let all of your staff know how much we thought of them, the thoughtfulness and attentiveness displayed time and again was simply amazing. The shear attention to every detail bordered on the preternatural..."


Just as an example of weird things that the folks at the skyloft took care of, I sort of mentioned I liked white noise to sleep by, and that at home I had an old humidifier that I turned on at night just for the noise, without a real specific request, a humidifier was placed in my bedroom minutes after this conversational exchange...

Also, the price varies widely, dont give up just because its says a ton one day...it may be much lower the next day...

do yourself a favor and stay at the skylofts, you wont be sorry.</p><br>Can't wait to get back!!!<p>Stayed in the SkyLofts for four nights and five days with some close friends for a "guys trip". The folks that run SkyLofts have it together as far as guest service is concerned. From the Butler to the Concierge these folks were on it from minute one to the moment we checked out.

We had a techincal problem with the iPod player in the room and the maintenance guy was there in seconds. The views were incredible. The bathroom made me want to renovate our bathroom back home to model the one at the SkyLofts. Unreal!

If you are looking for five star VIP treatment, then this is IT!</p><br></body></html>
