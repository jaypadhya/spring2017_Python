<html><head><h3>Skylofts at MGM Grand Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 28</h3></head><body><br>Unique Vegas experience<p>I would second what the other reviewers have said, the most amazing shower ever, infinity tub with champagne bubbles instead of blasting jets, and the best TVs and electronics we have ever seen in a hotel. I love the single remote for everything (climate control, window coverings, TVs etc).

The only downsides are, as mentioned by others, the MGM is not the classiest casino... especially on a fight weekend. Also the lack of a sit down vanity is inexplicable for a suite in this price range. I had to do my hair and makeup on the window sill opposite the desk for enough light.

There was also some mystery material floating in the tub when we turned it on. We called the butler to clean it out and he said it was remnants from the "chocolate bath" from the last guest. Kind of a disgusting thought, bathing in someone else's remnants.

Since our stay at the Skylofts, we have discovered the Signature at MGM. Much better prices, two full bathrooms, and a real kitchen. But I do miss the tub and shower from the Skylofts.</p><br>One of the best hotels in the world<p>The Skylofts at the MGM Grand is an amazing hotel-boutique. Everything they say on the website is true, and the staff is very friendly yet professional.
If you have the chance you should try it. I still believe that $600.00 a night (1-bdr loft, off season) is a bargain for what you get: open bar, free movies, amazing loft decor, wonderful shower/bathtub, and the best service that a hotel can provide.
Maybe the only negative point is that it is on the top floor of the MGM Grand. Don't get me wrong, MGM Grand is an okay hotel but it still a regular hotel with nothing special comparing to the Bellagio or Wynn. Luckly the MGM is changing little by little...</p><br>Not bad at all!<p>Lately we have been going to Las Vegas more often than I thought I would ever want to go. But, well, the food! Fabulous! We wanted to go to Robuchon and so we made a reservation at the MGM Skylofts. Both were just wonderful.

Now, I am being somewhat kind to the Skylofts because, while it did some things very very well, others were just a bit off.

Not so good: The view. Our skyloft overlooked Hooters and the airport. We spent so many hours staring at Hooters that we finally went and visited. Quite the experience.
The decor is just a bit off. Not as polished as they seem to think it is. It still says: we think we are being so cutting edge, but it is just slightly ridiculous, though I had such a good time I forgave them the decorating faux pas.
It is in the MGM Grand. Not one of the more chic hotels around.

Very good:
Robuchon is there (no, that is excellent)
The service was fabulous.
Loved the bathroom and the "infinity" tub (though I really could have done without the tv in the mirror and the one next to the tub and the 2 in the living room.)
The space is great. Loved the dinnig room table. Next time I will get room service from Craft and have a party.
Room service breakfast was terrific.
It is not the Bellagio. I had only stayed at the Bellagio previously and I think their rooms are horrid. Lobby much classier, but this is Las Vegas.
We will return to the Skylofts.</p><br>Pure Luxury<p>I cannot accurately describe the Skylofts in words. This place was unbelievable. Talk about first class service. If you can pay the price, it's worth it!

Upon arriving at the airport, a Mercedes Maybach will pick you up if you are a guest at the Skyloft. It's a beautiful ride.

Once to the hotel (the Skylofts are located inside the MGM Grand on their own private floor) your own private reservation specialist greets you, takes you to a private elevator for SkyLoft guests through the Skyloft lounge (you have to use your room key in the elevator to access the Skyloft floor), and into your suite. He/She will explain to you how everything works in the room and introduce you to your own personal butler.

The suites are to die for. We stayed in a one bedroom Skyloft and it was nothing short of gorgeous. With over 1,400 square feet, it is two stories. The main level consists of a foyer, half bath, living room, dining room, bar, stocked refrigerator, desk area, and two-story windows overlooking Las Vegas. The steps lead you to your bedroom, which overlooks the living room through glass panes and has an awesome view over Las Vegas. The bathroom is luxurious and huge. There's a tv in the mirror, two sinks, an awesome shower that's huge with a bench and multiple shower heads on the ceiling and walls, and a big jetted infinity bathtub with a television above it. I utilized both the shower and the bathtub. I honestly could have spent my vacation in this bathroom. There was also a big walk-in closet/dressing area with mirrors and plenty of drawers and hanging space. The decor is very modern and...well....loftish (if that's word, after all, it's a loft). The Skyloft floor is very very quiet. It's completely relaxing. I don't think we saw another guest during our whole stay, which was three nights.

The service was great. The Skylofts have their own personal concierge on the floor 24 hours a day. They are very pleasant and greet you every time you get off of the elevator. If you request something, it's there right away. I needed a laptop computer for business reasons during my stay and they supplied one within five minutes of my call. They brought an ironing board immediately upon my call. They had personalized stationary, fax cover sheets, etc. upon my arrival with my name. Every night there was a quote and flower left on the bed, as well as a "snack" on the table downstairs (which ranged from chocolates to berries).

The technology is great. One remote control controls everything. The tv, the radio, the two-story curtains/blinds, the lighting. Flat screen tv's everywhere, alarm clocks with IPOD docks.

When your stay if over, arrange for the Maybach to take you back to the airport (if that's where you are going) and go out in style. We did.

No complaints as far as I'm concerned. This is one of the nicest suites I've ever stayed in.</p><br>Amazing<p>I just loved the place.
I don't understand why for so long it didn't had it's own entry in tripadvisor, but finally this is fixed.

In one word :
Go.

We stayed at plenty of 5* hotels over the globe, but this one with the exception of a private (per room...) swimming pool has it all.
The decor, the staff, everything is amazing.

This is the greatest hotel in vegas.</p><br>The Best Place to stay in Vegas<p>Our annual trip to Las Vegas is our chance to get away from the daily drudge of work, life and being parents etc. After Four Nights at the Wynn, we decided to splash out and try the Skylofts for a few days having heard so many good things about it.

So its with a sigh of relief as the Maybach swings in and up the drive. The Wynn Bellman loads the luggage and we are off! A drive down Koval as we play with the features in the car and chat with our driver (would have liked to do the Strip but we didn’t ask, although it probably would have taken appropriate greasing of the palm to make it happen) and into the MGM the Skylofts Bellman gets our luggage and the concierge comes to greet us, the room isn’t quite ready yet, would we like to grab some lunch until it is?

We finish and are just taking a tour of the casino when my cellphone goes, our loft is ready, if we would like to come to the VIP Check in they will bring us up. Through the Door and our concierge is there to greet us. Up to the Top Floor and our Butler is waiting by the door. Check in Formalities are completed in the room and we get the tour, I strongly recommend you do this, even if the Guy in you thinks you can figure out how to use everything!

The Loft itself is just amazing! It truly is like an apartment, downstairs into the Marble Entryway through the Double Doors and there is a “Half Bathroom” with toilet and sink, before you step down into the Lounge where you see the full 24 foot windows. A little disappointing in that I had requested a Northwest Strip view when I made the reservation, we got a Southeast view of Hooters and the Airport, but you cannot have everything I suppose. Lounge has Sofa, Chairs and a B&O Plasma, as well as a CD/DVD. There is a Remote here where you can control the TV/CD/DVD, Climate, Lights, Drapes and in loft Music.

In the corner is the small office with the All-in-One Scanner/Printer/Fax as well as personalized stationary and Business Cards. Then there is the Dining Area with the table for Six (which has fresh Berries, refilled as and when), as well as the wet bar and Fridge with soft drinks, including my requests from when the Skylofts Call to set up our stay. There is also the $1000 Jura Coffee machine with a Range of Coffees available and a Sony Plasma if looking at the one in the Living Room Feels like a Stretch.

Up the stairs on the way you see into the Shower/Steam Room, That might be something to bear in mind if you are thinking of sharing this room with people you don’t know intimately or if you have some Modesty, well I guess either that or shower with a Swimsuit on. I know Glass Bathrooms are the thing these days, but I don’t know, they could have made it frosted glass.

Into The Bedroom - has another Sony Plasma and B&O CD/DVD set up, along with Surround Speakers, with a Glass Window “wall” looking out onto the living area and your view. There is another Universal remote for the upstairs.

The Bathroom had the full on walk in Steam shower with Six Shower heads, the Infinity Tub with another Plasma TV and the TV in the mirror and the full on walk in closet. This is one hotel room you can never complain about not having somewhere to put your clothes!

Our plan for the this part of our trip was to do little more than relax and hang out in our room and that is pretty much what we did in the afternoon taking full advantage of everything the Skylofts has to offer. Not only does the TV have all the Cable channels on Cox Digital, it also had all the “On Demand” movies for cable and in-house, again at no-charge (or part of the room rate depending on how you view it).

We decided to eat in the room one night, the Concierge brings us Menus from various places and we plump for Craftsteak, The Corn Soup and Red Peppers to start, for Entrée we each have the Rib Eye Each, with Gratin Potatoes and Onion Rings, I was a little apprehensive as I had heard mixed things about Craftsteak, but it was spot on! And with drinks on hand in the room and Butler service - life was feeling very good!!

At the end we were absolutely stuffed, no room for dessert! Let things go down and then the usual evening truffles came, this time they were like lollipops! and with coffee it was the perfect end to the evening.

They may not be the biggest suites in terms of actual square footage, although 1500 Square feet was more that enough for us!, but for the total package of Room, Amenities and Service, the Skylofts IMHO is #1 and not just in terms of Las Vegas, its right up there with some of the finest hotels in the world. If being on top of the MGM Grand is putting you off (and it concerned me when I first looked at staying there), don’t let it, it truly is a “Hotel within a Hotel” in every sense of the word. What it does share with the MGM, you get the VIP treatment. One thing I might ask is if I could take care of all the tips at the end of my stay, Cruise ship style, but that’s me being very picky.

If you want the high roller experience, but don’t have the play, are thinking about doing the Skylofts and, dare I say it, can afford it, then don’t think anymore, DO IT! Rates do go down as low as $590-600 for the 1 bedroom midweek. My Biggest regret is that I didn’t book for 3-4 nights instead of 2 and we are trying to work out when we can come back.</p><br>Exceeded all expecations<p>From the moment you're met at baggage and whisked to the SkyLofts in the Maybach you are transported to a different world. The room is jaw dropping - the infinity tub is filled and waiting, the butler is at your beck and call and the city lays out before you through the two story glass windows. Service throughout is friendly and polished. The restaurants are on par with the greats of the world - L'Atelier was mind blowing, while Nob Hill was intimate and refined. I'm not a big fan of Vegas in general, but this is an escape from the ordinary and a great bargain if you can score a mid week rate. Not to be missed!</p><br>superb<p>Just came from a stay off 4 nights at Skylofts at MGM. I never stayed in a place with that kind off sofistication. Ultra high tech gadgets! 3 plasmas on the room! bang olufsen sound system, etc.
The service was perfect, with a buttler that takes care off all your needs.
Pity that it location(on MGM), forces you to a serious downgrade if you want to use any MGM areas, like the pool.
It is not cheap(U$ 600 on weekdays), but, at this time I didn't feel stealed in paying an expensive rate.</p><br>Tudo de bom! Experiência única e staff  maravilha<p>ビジネスにてアメリカを訪れた際に、ラスベガスに立ち寄り、こちらのホテルを利用させていただきました。
タクシーにてスカイロフトのエントランスに到着し、バトラーがホテル内へ案内してくれますが、ホテル内に入るまでの経緯がVIPのような扱いで、非常に貴重な体験でした。

ホテル内はシンプルかつ美しく、静かで上品な雰囲気で、部屋の中は非常に大きく二階建て、ワークデスクもプリンターもあり、バスローブ、ベッド、全てが快適でした。残念ながらバトラーサービスを利用することはありませんでしたが、部屋自体は非常に清潔感があり快適です。職場の後輩と2人での宿泊でしたが、エクストラベッドをいれていただきました。

２階のベッドルームからは吹き抜けの窓から夜空が見え、
名前通り"Sky Loft"で寝ている心地でした。
今まで宿泊したホテルの中でも、最高峰のホテルだと感じました！
次回は、是非家族を連れて数泊宿泊したいと思っています。</p><br></body></html>
