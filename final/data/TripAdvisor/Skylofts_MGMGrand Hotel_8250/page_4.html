Staff is great, too the point that they try too hard to please. Love the espresso machine in the room and the walk in closet. Just right for all the clothes and shoes I bring.</p><br>Excellent<p>Best property I have ever stayed at and we have traveled quite a bit. The unique design makes you feel like you walk into Italy, great for couples and shopping
Perfect for downtown night activities. Stayed here 5 nights and could have stayed longer to enjoy the hotel itself. Front desk personnel were amazing and friendly, got us in fast with many front desk agents. Lobby beautifully decorate. My favorite hotel ever</p><br>very pleased<p>This is the nicest suite I have ever stayed in. Great service, friendly staff. Amazing experience. I couldn't have been more pleased. From the bellman to the drivers to the concierge, everyone was top notch.</p><br>This is how you Vegas<p>Amazing room, extremely clean. Staff is very friendly and helpful. Butler service is a great addition. Room is stocked with everything you need, and we were able to walk right in to Hakasan on a busy night with our room key.

Private lobby and elevator. MGM did it right, would stay again and recommend.

Put phone chargers in the room, make life just a little easier. Build them in to prevent them going missing, there are really only two types.</p><br>Excellence<p>Last weekend we were given the opportunity to experience the Skylofts at MGM. The level of luxury and excellence was something I have never encountered. The staff at the Skylofts are THE most professional group of individuals i have ever met. Paying attention to every detail of your stay and anticipating your every desire. Additionally the transportation in their Rolls Royce Ghost was an experience of a lifetime. We have been to many resorts and feel that the level of service and accommodations at the sky lofts are far superior to that of any we have encountered. Mark the butler, Vanessa the host and the rest of the staff i would like to thank you for your service.</p><br>Accommodation &amp; Service to die for<p>I stayed at the Sky Lofts at the MGM Grand a few weeks ago, the service and surroundings sets the highest standards for the Hospitality Industry. This was quite and experience!!!

Butler Service, your own elevator, professional service, very, very, very clean rooms.... I could go on and on. My advise, would be to try to stay at the Sky Lofts at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas on your next visit.</p><br>Can't be better<p>I stayed at this place for my honeymoon. This placed set the standards of how hospitality should be. Beginning with a beautiful room professional service they were able to accommodate all my requests even getting my latte from Starbucks.</p><br>Skylofts at MGM stay<p>One of a kind. Staying in the sky loft is like non other. The service and kindness in this area is unbelievable. Definitely advise to stay here. The room is clean and freshened all the time. It's always convenient to stay here because you have your own elevators for convenience.</p><br>Luxury Boutique<p>My husband and I spent the final night of our stay in Last Vegas, at the Sky Lofts at MGM Grand, on our Honeymoon this past October. The Roles Royce Ghost, Invite-Only dining at The Mansion, and steam-shower overlooking the strip are among the endless amenities and services available from this luxurious, Forbes 5-star rated (http://www.forbestravelguide.com/las-vegas-nevada/hotels/skylofts-at-mgm-grand), boutique hotel.</p><br>Amazing time as always at the MGM Skylofts<p>This was the third time I've stayed at the MGM Skylofts, this time for my 35th birthday. As always, it has exceeded my expectations. The lofts themselves are amazing, huge, and so elegantly appointed (I'm now fully obsessed with Bulgari shampoo). The butler and concierge were amazingly helpful, patient with my every request. The beds are delightfully comfortable, and they will give you basically any pillow you could dream of. The concierge can set you up with anything you may need. If you've got the money to spend, the MGM Skylofts are an absolute MUST STAY.

That being said, for a place as amazing as the Skylofts, I had a few minor complaints from this trip: (1) my hubby ordered wine and chocolate covered strawberries for my birthday (on Saturday) but they were delivered on Friday (not really a problem, just not on the right day as ordered), (2) the movies didn't work on the TV (I always look forward to catching up on my recent movies since I've got 2 small kids and zero personal time at home to go to the movies), and (3) we were picked up in an old limo (again not a problem but we've become accustomed to the RR Ghost and other higher end vehicle).

Nevertheless, we'll definitely stay at the Skylofts again in the future.</p><br></body></html>
