<html><head><h3>Skylofts at MGM Grand Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 9</h3></head><body><br>Rivals any suite or boutique hotel anywhere<p>This is my fifth stay at the MGM SkyLofts. I have stayed in the best suites in LV and this is still my favorite. Celebreties agree as they frequent the SkyLofts as well. The Ghost Rolls Royce Limo Service, your own Butler, drinks stocked to your liking, a pillow menu, multi jet, steam shower, overflow bath, remote controlled room, cappucino maker, 5 different coffee beans and tea leaves, room service that is exquisite, access to the Mansion private restaurant (they will make you whatever you please), fooze ball tables, workout rooms, amazing turndown service, entire suite audio/video/light/climate controller........and so much more. If you have the means, stay here.
Room Tip: 1 bedroom skyloft, perfect for couples

I am a snob when it comes to Vegas rooms and frequent the Penthouse suite at the Bellagio and have stayed in many hotel suites. This one was by far the best one yet! The Butler service was outstanding. I had many special requests and they graciously accommodated them all. My husband and I were there to get re-married for our 10 year anniversary and everyone at the Skylofts made it such a special trip. Had a great reception in the loft and the guests had a great time with our open bar, playing pool, nice sound system to play some loud music and the food. It was nice to have VIP access to clubs and reservations too! I cant wait to go back!</p><br>got to try this if your in Vegas<p>late review

nothing like it !!!

You pay a fortune in a 5 star in London or NYC - this is nothing like any of that garbage!
Great rooms - pool tables/music everywhere/butler service/Limo

We had a view right down the strip

hope to be back someday!!</p><br>Fantastic Service<p>We stayed at the SkyLofts a few times during business in Vegas. The check in could be faster but once you are in your "loft" it's smooth sailing.The personal butler is awesome-friendly and always helpful.The dining room was sexy and I wished we had a party there ! There was room ! The room service menu is great (and they are very accommodating to food allergies) The upstairs bedroom is FABULOUS ! You can control everything with one remote and that also means the light shades. It was DARK-AWWWWWW Sleepy sleep. The amazing spa shower & tub are my personal faves .Can't wait to go back. The decor downstairs needs an upgrade -it's a bit worn and dated.</p><br>Let's Be Serious: "IT IS THE BEST STAY IN VEGAS!"<p>We have stayed at the Skylofts many times, but just joined tripadvisor, so leaving a most recent review!
Reminds me of home, 29 stories in the sky! And the service is untouchable! You can literally go anywhere in Vegas and tell them your in the Skylofts, ...and you skip the line...no matter how long the waiting list, or how packed the nightclub, or anything! I have the Skylofts direct number programmed in my phone, and I usually just call them and say, "Hello, I'm standing at such and such...can you call and tell them I'm here?" Few minutes later, and we walk right in.
The staff, from the Skylofts private entrance, all the way to the top management, truly give you the celebrity experience!
This is by far our #1 choice EVERYTIME in Vegas!</p><br>Crazy !!!!<p>Speechless !!!! Was In Vegas for a couple days in December quite a quite time .. But that don't mean nothing as we can make a party in gymnasium ... The loft it self, off the hook ! I have never experienced anything like it .... Where else picks you up from the airport in a Rolls Royce Phantom (big up the driver) walks you to you room like the star that I am lol and will run to Fat Burger or McDonalds if you are feeling peckish? Obviously this room comes at a premium but is worth every penny trust me. The butler is a special touch and the room sorry suite is out of this world !!!!! Kinda wrecked the suite when we were there but pop out for 30mins and it's ready to trash again ! Amazing loool

Ok seriously highly recommend with the boys plenty space to enjoy 10 out of 10

Down fall is once you've stayed here it's going to be very hard to stay anyplace else.

Hopefully going to book for 7 days for my stag week in June.

I suggest you give it a try.</p><br>Not bad<p>When i stayed here the place was good and moderate when comparing to other areas!

Pricey but worth it. Be sure to dine at the Mansion if possible. Private experience,

air con worked fine, room was big, comfortable bed, not to noisy, my only gripe was the bathroom needed a new one badly, having said that the shower was very good</p><br>Great Spot Great Room Superior Service<p>Highly recommended for Vegas getaway. Pricey but worth it. Be sure to dine at the Mansion if possible. Private experience, only for Skyloft guests. Live like a high roller. Dinner at L'Atelier Robuchon one of the very best anywhere.</p><br>O dear god...<p>This place is awesome. I booked it for a buddy of mine for his Bachelor party. Let me say by saying the pictures really dont do justice for it....it's unbelievable. We had a two bedroom unit.

Starting out you get picked up by the rolls royce at LAS. From there, you go straight through the sky loft lobby and go striaght to your suite, where your butler is waiting, and the check in papers are waiting (we also had some awesome guava juice and fruit...we ended up buying pitchers of guava the entire weekend)....

Overall, just an awesome hotel. Will be staying here for all of my next vegas trips@!</p><br>Major improvement from my last visit<p>Staff was very attentive, especially Mark - one of the butlers. Room was great, really like the ones in the 700 numbers. Everything that could go right, did. Fridge was stocked just the way I like it, pillows were perfect, the little bath tea bags were back and even breakfast was good.</p><br></body></html>
