<html><head><h3>Skylofts at MGM Grand Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 26</h3></head><body><br>Everyone should do this at least once!<p>One of the experiences in life that should not be passed up! When the private elevator arrives at the top floor and you are escorted past the AAA Five Diamond award plaque only then do you realize that it seems every employee in the building has been informed of your "arrival." The Skylofts is absolutely, positively over the top, and why not...It's VEGAS!

I was fortunate enough to stay in a 2-bedroom loft during my stay. When I say loft I mean 3000 square feet of the most extravagant, state of the art living known anywhere. If modern is your thing I have not seen a hotel that comes close to this place at any price. The room itself is worth the price of admission, the personal service puts it over the top. From the moment you are picked up in the Maybach limo you start to realize what is to come. Ask the driver to demonstrate how the glass roof magically changes from frosted to transparent, very cool. Pulling into the sea of people and vehicles at the front entrance of the MGM, everything seems to yield to you. A side entrance to a private elevator and a quick ride up to the top floor wisks you from the fast action of the casino floor to the tranquil serenity of the Skylofts commons. A short walk follows to your room where your butler awaits and you are presented with your check-in documents, sitting at your dining room table with a welcome beverage and fresh fruit. I would highly recommend taking the butler's offer of a tour and demonstration of the technology and features of the room.

Don't let the formal appearance of the staff intimidate you. They are very friendly and understanding to guests such as myself that aren't accustomed to this amount of pampering. Don't hesitate to ask questions, they will do whatever is possible to satisfy your request and make you feel comfortable. When I inquired about possibly eating at Craftsteak that night, I was met with a reservation at the time I requested. What I wasn't prepared for was the very large table in the center of the restaurant that had the appearance it was reserved for special guests. Coincidence? Probably not.

Some previous guests complain about the Skylofts being located in the MGM. I disagree, I say take it for all it has to offer. Have the concierge arrange the best seats in the house to KA, eat dinner at the restaurant of your choice. It's all just a short walk. Once you tire of the action downstairs, a quick elevator ride transports you back to your room and the world away from reality.

Tips for the first stay at Skylofts:
- Don't forget your iPod. The room has a docking station/charger that integrates all your songs, controllable through the remote controls, to all the speakers in the room. When I say speakers, I mean the most crystal clear Bang & Olufsen speakers I've ever heard.

- Attend the cocktail hour in the commons area. Apparently most of the celebrities staying at the MGM choose to stay in the Skylofts. You never know who you might bump into.

- Order room service. The prices are reasonable. When I requested breakfast at 7:30, there literally was a knock at the door at 7:30, not a second before or after. Not sure how they managed to be exactly in sync with the watch on my wrist, but I wouldn't be surprised...

The first thing I do now when planning a trip to town is check room rates at the Skylofts, it really is that good!</p><br>Very impressive<p>Spent four days here with my daughters, age 5 and 4. We had a two-bedroom suite. Had a pool table. The kitchen is nice, but no sink. Kim the butler organized a bottle of bourbon and wine. Brought Shirley Temples one night.
The technology in the room is overwhelming, but it is really fascinating. Takes a day or two to get it squared away, but once you've got the hang of it, it's a piece of cake. Wife plugged in her IPOD downstairs and controlled it upstairs and it played throughout. Free movies are cool -- kids watched some and we watched I Am Legend on hangover night. [Porno is free too so even if it isn't your thing, it's LV and it's free!]
The room will not disappoint.

Being at Skylofts may be the best part. Dinner at Picasso. Had the best seat in the house, literally in front of the fountain at Bellagio. Tickets for 4 to Mystere at TI -- fourth row, center. Out with the wife to TABU. Ben, our host, set us up with everything. Came back the next night and he gave us a table (gratis) and a drink.
What I'm getting at, it isn't just the Skylofts themselves, but being in the Skylofts. You've got access to the best of everything. That's hard to quantify. But you aren't slugging it out with the rest of the schmos. You go to the front and have the best seat, just because you're Skylofts.

The only drawback really is that you are at the MGM Grand, which is okay, but certainly not in the class of the LV's nicest hotels. But with children, while the Rainforest Cafe is all kitsch, they loved that and the lions. The pool too is excellent for children. Rented a cabana for three days and while not cheap, $200 each day, ($400 on Friday when Bon Jovi was there), it's good. [Saw Tom Jones in the Skylofts lobby -- all the stars playing MGM Grand are at Skylofts.]

I think I'd do it again. Nightly rate $1,000, but spent double that with babysitters, drinks, dinner and so on.

When making a concierge request, don't make it early in the morning or very late at night -- those are the overnight guys and they don't know anything and aren't that helpful. Hit the day staff who are much more professional.

Problems at Skylofts? I'm broke and it's time to pay my taxes, but more importantly, was it worth it? Yes.</p><br>Nice Stay<p>I can't add much more then the other reviewers already have,great service, the lofts are nice although the one we were in showed a little wear and tear.This place still rises above 99% of any other hotels,especially in Vegas.This place is like being in Vegas except it's nice and quiet on the Skyloft floor.I would highly recommend it and I hope to stay here in the future.</p><br>Despite the price, this is a great value in Vegas!<p>We stayed at Skylofts for two nights in early March 2008. On the third morning we headed to another Vegas hotel (Hard Rock) known for it's pool area. Unfortunately when we arrived we were informed that the pool was closed for renovations.
We immediately checked out and called our Skylofts concigere.

Unfortunately Skylofts was sold out but offered to put us up at their Signature property that night and then back into a Skylofts suite for our final night. The Signature was great but we could not wait to get back to our Skylofts experience..

Everything you will read in the other reviews is true. They are really great rooms. They are even a great value. Compare the prices to a suite at the Four seasons, Wynn, Trump, or the Hard Rock.

We live in a high tech loft that I designed in Chicago and were still blown away by the skylofts vibe. Our only knock was on their pool area. My last visits to Vegas included stays at the Hard Rock and Four Seasons. Both have much nicer pool areas.

Skylofts shares their pool area with the MGM hotel. It is designed with a 1970's country club feel and is not up to par for a high end boutique hotel. The good news is that they have built a new facility! We were told that it will be restricted to Skylofts customers, Suites at the MGM and space available paying customers. You can see some photos of this new pool area above. Our understanding is that the space is set to open this summer. It will put them back over the top and be on par to the Hard Rock Rehab RX party area!

If you are on the fence about booking a room at this hotel I'd highly recomend it for the privacy, security, and ambiance. It is a great experience. The service is flawless. Be prepared to tip...often! As a bonus, how often will you get the chance to ride in a chaufeur driven Maybach?

One final tip. If you have an early check in or late check out due to flights I would encourage you to book the private spa room. It offers two showers, a tub, exercise bikes, and a massage table and will allow you to freshen up prior to or after a flight. I believe that the charge was $50 per hour and we found it quite refreshing. It was very private and luxurious final touch to our stay after being by the pool all afternoon.

Enjoy!</p><br>One of the BEST!!!<p>My family happen to stay in Skylofts due to the invitation of my uncle which is considered to be a high roller. My uncle was given by the hotel 4 - 2 bedroom Skyloft Suites. The 2 suites was given to our family and the other two for my uncle's family. Skyloft is the penhouse suite in MGM Hotel. It is in the top floor of MGM and has its own reception area and conceirge where all your needs are taken care of. Stand-by limousine service is at your disposal anytime of the day. Free limousine pick-up within entire Las Vegad is also available. The reception area could book you to almost anything - concerts, shows, restaurants. Staying in Skyloft also gives you VIP treatment in MGM and all MGM group of Hotels. You just show your room key and anyone from MGM group will be glad to assit your needs, eventhough you are in Bellagio, you will be given VIP treatment. The suite is perfect. It is equip with the best equipments you could possibly imagine. From the most expensive sound system, tv and even coffee maker. The pantry and the bar is free and could be refilled many times as you want by just asking the reception. There's a exclusive elevator for Skyloft guests. Our Stay was all free and even our show tickets and food due to my uncle's hig roller status. But I think the 2 bedroom suite in Skyloft is between USD 500.00 to 600.00 a night. But If you have the money to spend, I would definitely recommend this hotel.</p><br>The Skylofts is the Best Hotel in Vegas BY FAR!!!!<p>This is perhaps the best hotel experience you can buy in Vegas, notwithstanding the fantasy bungalows and villas that casino hotels reserve just for the high-rollers.

We've stayed at the Four Seasons, Bellagio, Venetian, Wynn and THEHotel, and the Skylofts blow each one of those out of the water.

We stayed in a a 1 bedroom Skyloft before Christmas, and it was simply amazing. It starts out with getting picked up in a Maybach. That's probably the nicest car in the world, arguably nicer than the Rolls-Royce Phantom, which we also took from another hotel. The ride is only 10 minutes, but it sets the tone for the rest of your stay.

Once you arrive at the MGM, your concierge will be waiting for you downstairs in the driveway. You are then personally escorted through the MGM lobby, into the VIP area, and then into private elevators just for Skylofts guests and VIPs.

The Skylofts are on the Penthouse floors of the MGM. Why I say "floors" is because each Skyloft is a duplex! Our 1 bedroom was already huge at 1,500 square feet, but because the living room ceiling is basically two floors, the whole feeling is like an atrium, which makes the room feel even bigger. I'm talking about a 30 foot high glass window overlooking the Strip. Ridiculous.

In the room there are too many amenities to mention. B&O plasma and sound system controlled by a Crestron remote that controls EVERYTHING. Bring your iPod since there is an iPod dock on one of the walls which allows the Crestron remote to read off all your songs and play your iPod through the B&O system!

This remote also controls all the lighting and even two sets of blinds/curtains for the living room window. There's a Crestron remote in the upstairs living room too that has all these functions.

Besides the B&O plasma, there are a total of 5 flatscreen TVs in the room. Yes, that many. A HDTV LCD in the bedroom, another one downstairs in the 6 seat dining room, and two in the upstairs bathroom, by the bath and IN THE MIRROR. Not only that, but besides having hundreds of channels including HD, ALL PAY-PER-VIEW MOVIES ARE FREE! Yes, even adult movies...everything.

Also free are snacks and non-alcoholic drinks. Yes, everything except the alcohol in the mini-bar are complimentary. This includes the espresso/cappuccino machine in which there are 4 types of coffee beans in jars for your choosing, all free, which are ground up fresh in the coffee machine and made all with the touch of a button.

That's not all - the shower, which is bigger than most hotel bathrooms, is also a steam room! Yes, no joke, it's like your own personal sauna with a seat as well. What's more, there is a glass wall in the shower which looks into the staircase of the loft, and then onto the Vegas strip! Yes, you can have an amazing view of the strip while you are taking your shower. Ridiculous.

There's also a huge long walk-in closet that could probably fit in your entire wardrobe from home, and then some. The bed itself is amazing, as I remember, Frette linens and one of the softest hotel mattresses I have ever slept on.

But besides the amazing room, what really sets Skylofts apart is the concierge. You would not be getting the full Skylofts experience if you don't utilize the concierge. By this, I mean they can get you anything. Last-minute restaurant reservations, awesome seats at any show, and VIP passes to any club. We partied up bigtime due to it being so hassle-free with the concierge at your fingertips. If we didn't have that, there's no way we could have just walked into all those clubs with lines, or gotten amazing seats to sold-out shows. Especially if the show is in one of the MGM-Mirage hotels, which seems to be half the strip nowadays.

Despite me starting out this review by saying Skylofts is second only to the the fantasy bungalows and villas like the Mansion at MGM, our concierge told us that the week before our stay, the biggest celebrities in the world including Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie attending the Mayweather-Hatton fight all choose to stay at the Skylofts over the Mansion, as did both Hatton and Mayweather. So that tells you something. If you are interested in seeing what the Mansion is all about, Skylofts residents can have their breakfast at the Mansion dining room. We did this one morning - very expensive, but worth it! We were the only ones in the room and the breakfast was phenomenal! However, the decor is much more traditional luxury style, which is why younger folks and celebrities might prefer the Skylofts, which is very modern and very chic.

If you can afford it, definitely make your next Vegas stay at the Skylofts. It's living about as large as you can in Vegas, and don't forget to hit up the Skylofts concierge to set up everything for you, including shows, restaurants and clubs.</p><br>The most amazing place to stay<p>We stayed at the MGM for nine nights, seven nights in the tower rooms and two nights in the sky loft. The tower room was lovely but the sky lofts were absolutely amazing. We went for the Ricky Hatton fight (apparently he was staying in the sky lofts too plus Mayweather and a load of other famous people) The staff were brilliant, nothing too much trouble. You really are made to feel so special.If we go back to Vegas for another fight we would stay in the Sky lofts again hopefully for the whole duration of our stay.</p><br>Sky Lofts Is Spectacular!<p>My 3 night stay at Sky Lofts was absolutely amazing! Everything the previous reviews state is true. In my opinion, this is the best hotel room (more like a luxury apartment) in Vegas. It's another world on the top floors of the MGM Grand! The one bedroom loft I booked was phenomenal - floor to ceiling glass duplex overlooking the strip & desert, separate dining area, living room, office, loft bedroom, and massive spa bathroom with infinity tub (mood lighting in tub), and steam / sauna / rain shower - no need to go to a spa! Huge walk-in closet. The entire loft is tricked out with flat screen tv's in every room, crestron controls to adjust blinds, lights, tv, etc. A chauffer meets you at the airport and drives you to the hotel in a Maybach - off the hook! The loft decor is simple, tasteful, contemporary, and comfortable - a chic hotel look. A private butler is at your service 24 hours a day. Fresh berries are placed on the dining room table daily to enjoy. Soda, water, juice, and coffee are free. All cable channels are available, plus free Showtime, HBO, and In Demand movie channels. Room service was a delight and a lovely table was set. As far as the rest of the MGM Grand, the casino is fine, there are some fantastic restuarants (try Craft Steak), KA was amazing, and the pool area is very nice. Yes, there is a McDonalds & Starbucks, but they are located far away from the lobby and Sky Lofts private entrance. If you are in the mood to be pampered and are more interested in staying in a luxury Vegas apartment more than a standard hotel room, Sky Lofts is perfect! I will return.</p><br>Now that's what I call a hotel<p>OK - I've stayed in some pretty cool hotels around the world so it takes a lot for me to be impressed. I was - in fact off the scale impressed. I had previously spent 3 nights in the Wynn tower suites to see what that had to offer. There really is no comparison. Prices fluctuate wildly depending on when you book, I paid $790 a night - that's about £400 with the current exchange rate. I have seen rooms listed for as little as $510. Now that is just plain crazy. For that price you would need committing to the nut house not to take advantage.

Everything about the experience was just great. From the collection by the Maybach to the whole check-in experience it's like experiencing how the other half live and I like it a lot. Nothing is too much trouble, and little things like the desk staff standing when you walk through the loft lobby to hotel staff stopping and standing to the side in the corridors while you pass. This is a lesson in ultimate customer service.

I actually don't mind the MGM Grand hotel areas. I'm not really a snob and like the fact that there are McDonalds & Starbucks down there. But I do love the fact that when I retire to my room I am surrounded by gadgets and Luxury.

I will definitely be staying again and would recommend the Skylofts to anyone who wants to live like a Movie Star, even if it is for just a couple of days.</p><br>Great Room, Great Service, but still in the MGM<p>First, it is hard to add anything that has not been said already. Top quality service, best room I have ever stayed in, and everything is run first class. Our room had a great view of the strip and amenities stacked on top of amenities. The shower and the Infinity tub were great along with the electronics throughout the loft. I am not sure who it was that could not figure out how to turn the lights and TV off in the bathroom but everything was pretty self explanatory to us. If you needed anything all you had to do was pick up the phone and it was considered done.

The only downside to the Skylofts was that you were in the MGM. The MGM Mirage Company owns ½ the Vegas strip, and with much nicer hotels like the Bellagio and Mandalay Bay, I don’t understand why you would not put the lofts there. Private elevators are a MUCH needed addition. Don’t get me wrong, this is still one of the best rooms around. I would have no problems in making a return visit. I would just like to see some subtle changes made.</p><br></body></html>
