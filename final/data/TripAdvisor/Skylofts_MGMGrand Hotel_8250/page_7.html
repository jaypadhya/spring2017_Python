<html><head><h3>Skylofts at MGM Grand Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 7</h3></head><body><br>Good service, nice room<p>Visited again at the end of March 2014 for my birthday and 25th wedding anniversary. Mark, the butler, was waiting for us at the room and he paid very close attention to ensure that all the things we liked were in the room. Upon arrival, we found that they had waiting for us; champagne (gift from my friends), my favorite carrot cake from Wolfgang, Tequila (gift from me to my husband) and cigars for him.

It was greatly appreciated, my only complaint was that they overcharged for the tequila ($900) for the bottle, 3 times the regular price. Did they fly it in first class from Mexico? As well, I asked the concierge to do something with the cake when we went out at 1:00 PM in the afternoon and it was still sitting on the dining room table when we got back at 7:00 PM. Cream cheese doesn't do well out in the open, therefore it had to be thrown out and I did not get to enjoy it as planned.

All-in-all, it was a good trip except for the weather. windy and cold.</p><br>The place to stay while at Vegas<p>This is definitely the best place to stay at while visiting Vegas. We were here for 5 days and were blown out of our minds by the impeccable service and great food.
The location also creates caters to an amazing stay.</p><br>The TOP of Vegas.....the service that is.<p>While in Vegas the only place to stay for the truly discerning is Skyloft. Want to know their little secrete on why its the TOP for service....Communication..... every service member has the ability to talk to ever other service member on the floor, via earpiece. Now with that said. have I stayed in more luxurious locations with better technology, YES. The lofts haven't had a major update since 2009 and are getting a bit dated.... but they make up for it with impeccable communication. now all they need to do in update the tech in the loft (Creston circa 2009 .... come on I have more control in my iPhone) and it will be the perfect experience again.
Room Tip: For a single loft strip view request loft 77, it's my personal favorite.

I must say that what the hotel lacks in posh and eccentric finishes that the newer resorts have included to create an upscale mood, MGM is probably forced to include a wise business plan to offer fabulous room deals to accommodate a lower budgeted guest because they have so many rooms to fill. Because of this, they tend to pull a more casual crowd which is just fine for many but it doesn't blend well with the Skyloft Suites impeccable rooms and service of a discerned traveller. If this is not an issue for you, don't bother to stay anywhere else but at Skylofts. OMG, I have stayed at probably 50 5 Star resorts around the world and hands down, you will not find better appointed and dramatically decorated rooms that include top knoch upscale service provided by all of their staff. It was truly a joy to stay here. They make you truly feel like a high roller in Vegas or a celebrity for sure. From the minute you get off of the plane and back on, the Skyloft staff are at your service for every tiny need and they definitely follow through as their advertising suggests. Don't stay anywhere else if this is important to you. Private limo to and from airport included, separate entrance and uneventful check-in to be much appreciated when you see what the rest of the guests must go through. Professional doormen and baggage handlers greeting you with a smile and the best concierge team I have ever met. Room service is more than that. While on the Concierge level, a kitchen is hidden on your floor with servers ready to jump and be in your room with morning coffee in minutes. They even bring extras like cookies, etc. I went out to the main lobby area on our floor to get a complementary glass of wine and was told they'd bring it to my room. I thought that was odd until they arrived one minute later with cheese and crackers to accompany it around 5p.m. What I wish to add that is different about my review is that I decided to test their promise to get you into the hotels club which "clubbers" know is a big deal. I didn't have any pre-arrangements, reservation, or a table. Sitting across from Hakkassan (one of the top Vegas Clubs) at their lounge on night, I saw lines out the door with hundreds of people trying to get in for a famous DJ. Around midnight, I simply called my concierge from the Bar's house phone and asked if they could get me and my friends in without waiting in line. They did better. I got 6 of us in without paying the $80 pp fee as well and went straight to the front of the line without any VIP host. They were waiting for us and had my name. My visit was for a wedding here in March. While visiting with my daughter, we decided to venture around and look at other hotels for her 21st birthday celebration with my husband, sons and friends because my husband is a bit of a stiff. I would have stayed here again if I could have gotten one of their 2 or three bedroom suites. The rates for these rooms and services are also less expensive too than other two and three bedroom hotels, but the rooms are the finest you can locate on the strip and definitely worth every dollar. I know for a fact that other hotels charge much more and definitely give you a lot less as I am seeing with my current booking at the upper level Encore Suites coming up this June. Mr. Steve Wynn really needs to step it up a notch or two here. I am feeling very discouraged with the lack of extra special treatment I am missing from Skyloft's awesome services. I am currently booked into one Salon Suite with an adjoining King Suite and another Parlor Suite with an adjoining King Suite to make two-(2) bedrooms with living areas. What Encore and Wynn absolutely have in overall resort accommodations over MGM, they are seeming to lack in offering a private concierge level of service. On this trip, I am wishing to reserve a table at their nightclub XS and Beach Club and have explained that the entire trip is surrounded by a 21st Birthday. Hence, first time the "kid" can get into a club and drink legally. While I have been directed to the Club's VIP host, I have been repeatedly told that they can't work with me until 2 weeks before the date. WHAT? But 10 plane tickets are already paid for and $15,000 in rooms are already booked. They said that they don't have any affiliation with the club, but you'd think their top tier hotel guests could be taken care of in advance. I am even willing to pay the $3,500 reservation table fee. So what gives? Now, I am not a clubber, but a Mom. However, this is important in Sin City with all of the Bachelors and Bachelorettes to frequent Las Vegas. Lastly, I love how I had an assigned concierge provided to me prior to my arrival to make all of my dinner and show arrangements along with anything my heart desired. I always dealt with the same person and this is not the case I am experiencing with Wynn. While their employee's are very helpful, this is one of the refined perks with Skylofts that make you feel like a King or Queen. I already feel like I am going to regret not having re-booked with Skyloft, especially since my daughter wants to get into Hakkassan at midnight on Friday, June 13th when she turns 21. I just can't afford to buy two tables, two nights in a row to ensure an uneventful entry for her group at midnight. We elected to buy the Saturday Night table at XS since Lil Jon is performing, but right now, I don't know if I will even get that. Isn't this shameful and I already checked MGM's website to switch bookings but they are already full and can't make up two bedrooms connected at this late stage for me. LIVE AND LEARN. Sometimes a newer resort isn't fun if you can't get in to their restaurants and clubs to enjoy their amenities anyway. Skyloft ensures you can, not just at their resort but at many others since they own a large portion of Casinos and Hotels on the Strip.</p><br>Best Of The Best!!!<p>6,000 Square feet, personal butler, concierge, private elevators, arranged transportation & tranquility. Need I say more? No stay in Vegas after staying in the Skylofts will be the same. If you can afford it, stay here. You won't regret it! It was 6 of us in a three bedroom loft for mother's day weekend. My mom, my two aunts, my sister and my grandmother. I couldn't have asked for a better trip. I don't want to leave. If you read my pervious reviews, I have stayed at MGM before which wasn't a good experience so when my aunt booked here I didn't want to go. Little did I know, our mother's day gift from here was the Skyloft! As we rose to the 29th floor (top floor) of MGM with champagne in tow I knew it was going to be a good trip. That it was. I felt like I was in another world during our stay in the Skylofts. I never want to stay anywhere in Vegas again.</p><br>The sky lofts are amazing BUT<p>The MGM hotel itself is a bit of a dump.

The Sky Loft was huge with amazing views of the strip. The room itself was one of the largest and best I've ever stayed in. Likewise the service was exceptional.

The problem is when you step outside the Sky loft. The MGM is shabby. Let's say the Sky lofts are 9/10. The MGM is only 3/10. That goes for the hotel and the clientele.

For that reason I'm glad I've stayed there, but wouldn't go back.</p><br>Skylofts at MGM Grand<p>What to say about the Skyloft , otherwise it's great !
Everything is done to keep a lasting memory !
It stayed 2 days at 4 in a loft with 2 bedrooms for 4 adults and a little girl of 3 years.
Meet at airport limousine , it continues with a visit to the loft with the butler that explains everything!
Light that can be changed ( different environments ) to music in every room , hot pool, sauna, TVs embedded in the mirrors in the bathroom! ...
Designer décor and a beautiful arrangement ...
He has everything, an espresso machine , a pool table, a TV lounge with a list of DVDs available, rooms and lavish bathrooms , space (300 square meters ) ...
There were gifts for our daughter, two gorgeous fabrics ( we offer ) , large cradle decorated especially for her , treats every night , a discreet but efficient service (you " prepare " the bed every night with a poem and a flower ) ...
A cake was prepared by them for the birthday of my husband ( a sublime chocolate cake they offered )
A splendid view either the Strip are the mountains that you can see through the huge windows 4 meters high!
It is very expensive either , but it's terrific ! !</p><br>Just wonderful<p>I took a group of friends to Skylofts and we stayed in five one bedroom lofts. Since I was doing this as a treat for my friends it was important that arrangements be made in advance. The people at Skylofts took care of everything. That's important when you are in charge of a group. The last thing I need are annoyances. But the Skylofts people made it easy for me to pay for the rooms, get welcome gifts in the lofts, get us a cabana, and restaurant reservations. They manage to provide a luxury experience without crossing the line to pretension. They made everyone in my group feel comfortable and relaxed. And that's what I wanted from this trip most of all.
Room Tip: This was the first time I stayed in a one bedroom loft. The two bedroom lofts have more features and...

Thanks to our butlers, Mark, Yumi, and Christine who treated us like the most special guests ever. The concierge service was second to none. Everything was first class. Thanks also goes out to our host Melinda Marshall for helping both me and my wife surprise each other. She's simply the best and she certainly helped make our trip one of the most memorable stays in Vegas....ever. There is only one way to describe the SkyLofts experience--first class. Every member of the staff that we interacted with was super nice and friendly. They go out of their way to make you feel special. No negatives to mention. We stayed at the Bellagio Penthouse suite before and can honestly say SkyLofts won us over. This is a special place run by special people who are dedicated to making you feel special every day.</p><br>Skylofts Are The Best<p>Once again another terrific stay at the Skylofts. You are treated like a VIP from arrival until departure. Lofts are fantastic, beds are awesome. Concierge's go the extra mile to fulfill all requests. Thanks Aldene Espino and Paul Cieslewicz. Breakfast at the Mansion is fantastic, I highly recommend. I will be back.</p><br></body></html>
