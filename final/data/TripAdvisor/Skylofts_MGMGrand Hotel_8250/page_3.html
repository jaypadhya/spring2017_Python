Stayed in a 1 bedroom loft, ask for a strip view its a must.
Bathroom was amazing from steam double showers with views of strip to infinity bath with mood lightening and tv on wall.
everything in loft run by a remote control.
Lovely Presseco and chocolate strawberries as a welcome for our anniversary/hubby birthday.

Room Tip: Ask for loft looking over strip
See more room tips</p><br>Perfect service with an immaculate loft<p>This place is absolutely insane. Stay here and feel like a high roller. They pick you up in a rolls royce ghost from the airport, escort you straight to your loft where your butler and luggage is already waiting for you. Faith, who helped us check in and was there for most of our trip, was the most delightful and helpful. The concierge team as a whole was great. We stayed in the two bedroom loft. There were 4 living areas, a foosball table in one of them, a mini fridge that was constantly stocked, two bedrooms, and crazy big bathrooms with walk in closets. We absolutely felt like VIP's and i cant rave enough about the treatment we received and the amazingness of the loft. One tip: do yourself a favor and go have breakfast at the mansion.
I dont think ill ever be able to stay in a regular room anymore because this places spoils you rotten. Thank you MGM, Skylofts, Faith, and the concierge team. You gave my buddies and i the experience of a lifetime!</p><br>Skyloft revisited<p>We were last here over two years ago in the fall and had a stunning Strip view. This time we requested a North Strip view, but were unable to get it and had a southern exposure facing the airport. With the temperature hovering toward 115 degrees outside, as has been commented in other reviews, the air conditioning in many of these units is simply unable to cope. With the temperature set at 65, the best that we could do was 76 degrees downstairs and a bit warmer up in the loft. They did provide high tech fans that made it relatively comfortable, but I would caution anyone who comes here in the summer to be prepared for the heat, both inside and out. We ended up keeping our shades drawn most of the day which helped to a degree (but not quite enough degrees).

That said, the overall experience of staying in the lofts remains exceptional. The concierge service is outstanding, and there really isn't much they can't or won't do for you. VIP show tickets to see Terry Fator? No problem. Game council for my grandson? Kept him occupied for an entire evening. Need a late night snack from Nathan's brought up to the room? Done.

As we drove to Vegas and were unable to avail ourselves of the free pickup from the airport, we were allowed to use the Rolls to and from one of the other hotels We ordered up dinner from one of the restaurants, ate breakfast in the Mansion, and overall felt totally pampered.

I would definitely come back and stay here, but not in the summer.</p><br>Nothing can ever compare to this!<p>I can honestly say that this place is hands down the best place I have every stayed in the Vegas ever.I have been to so many hotels over the years and this is it! No joke! The room, service...everything. When you are spending that kind of money... you do expect "that kind" of service and you get it!</p><br>PEACE during Boxing Biggest Event ever !<p>I was pleasantly surprised by the elegant accommodations of the Skylofts Suites at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas. Located in a private floor above the multitude of people at this city of entertainment, you can only access them thru a private elevator. The Skylofts are perfect accomodation to take a break from the action and noise downstairs. Both of our room service orders were deliver on time and complete. The room was very clean and well supplied with High thread count towels and ropes. The MGM offers an incredible collection of restaurants in every price and menu category. Strongly recommend the Chinese restaurant located next to the main floor baccarat Pit. Looking forward to a quick return to the MGM.
Room Tip: Pay more.. You get what you pay !
See more room tips</p><br>Skyloft stay<p>Comfortable, B&O sound and telephone systems. Good butler and great furniture. Restaurants are great, good options. Everything from Macdonalds until buffets, Japanese fare and French restuarant experience. There's many magic shows and good casino area, lots of options!</p><br>Amazing!!!<p>I loved, Loved, LOVED the room...although I dislike the MGM, I didnt know this was located inside of MGM. The service was amazing, the staff was outstanding...the car service was on point...I'd can't wait to get back</p><br>Anniversay special<p>One of the most enjoyable places I've ever stayed. We are in fact going there again in October for a significant birthday. The service and attention to detail is second to none and I have never heard them say we "can't do it".
Who doesn't want a bath run for them after a night out!
Room Tip: Any in The Lofts are great
See more room tips</p><br>Another perfect stay<p>The true Vegas experience. Pampered, Spoiled, Perfect, Relaxing, Exciting, ......all describe a SkyLofts experience. If you want to do Vegas like a Champ, do it here. The hardest part is returning back home to reality. skyLofts is truly a five diamond property. I have stayed at a few other five star Vegas resorts, and they should be 4 1/2 at best, compared to SkyLofts. Make sure to utilize Mansion dining privileges. Breakfast "outside" in the glass enclosed Atrium is amazing. Also, utilize your butler/concierge when you first check-in (stocked beverages, pillow choices, dinner reservations, amenities, car service/ Ghost Rolls Royce, etc.). The service is what sets this place apart-take advantage of it.</p><br></body></html>
