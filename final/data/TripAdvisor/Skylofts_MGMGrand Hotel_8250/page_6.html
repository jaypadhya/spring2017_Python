The service is unprecedented. All service staff have been trained at the highest level of professionalism with high society in mind. I've never had this type of service. There is a butler for goodness sake :)</p><br>Great Trip<p>Very Friendly folks great service Sky lofts is the way to go.
Worth the stay. The profesional service you get is unbelievable
The staff really cares. They have staff members right on the sky loft floor. They would wall me down to the car that would take me to a meeting. The car comes with the room and they are waiting fir you at the airport when you arrive.

Room Tip: Sky lofts are fun

We did not ask them to work on it. So maybe it would have been better. Our thermostat was set to 65 but never got below 70 downstairs.</p><br>MGM Sky Lofts are Best in Vegas.<p>MGM Sky Lofts are Best.

Forget the Aria Sky suites

The Head to Head.

Checkin Sky Suite. wait in line like cattle, Sky Loft in room by your personal butler.

Service, Sky Suite a welcome note, Sky Loft, fresh juice and complementary soft drinks, 24 personal butler service.

Room, Both are lovely, Sky Loft has higher ceilings.

Minor problems, Sky Suite. wait, Sky Loft immediate in room service by personal butler.

Prices, both are approximately the same.

Check out, Sky Suites get in line again, Sky Lofts, sit, let them serve you a drink and go through your bill in relaxed fashion.

Bottom-line, for value and service, forget the Aria’s Sky Suites and go straight to the MGM Sky Lofts.</p><br>Perfection at its best<p>This was our first trip to Las Vegas and my girlfriend and I decided to book two days stay at the Skyloft. We took a domestic flight from New York City to Las Vegas and our driver was waiting for us and surprisingly enough with the Rolls Royce, It was my birthday and the pick up made my day even better. Once we arrived to the Hotel we had the best staff ever, the loft was so beautiful and they all made us feel at home. They make you feel like royal! We want to say a special thanks to Justin, Ted and Santiago for the best service we have ever gotten and we have stayed at a lot of hotels but the Skyloft service is out of this world. They were just a call away and were always so helpful with all of our requests! Our two day stay at the Skyloft ended in a 7 day stay because we just had to return to Las Vegas the following week and this is all thanks to Skyloft and their amazing service! The concierges at the front desk at the Skyloft were amazing aswell, and a special thanks to Paul for his kindness! There are so many people we would want to thank but there are just way too many! Thanks to everyone who made us feel at home. This was definitely worth every penny and we would never return to Las Vegas without staying at the Skyloft. We were so sad that we had to leave Skyloft and continue our trip throughout USA but we want to thank our driver, Lena, for lifting our mood with her humor, as we told her we wouldn't have enjoyed Vegas half as much without Skyloft.

Maria & Dario</p><br>Really good..<p>One of my best experience, Our room was clean and Large, Beds are awesome, far exceeded the expectations. Attention to details, Very good customer service. All employees were polite and helpful.

Thanks guys, We will be back</p><br>Wonderful Skylofts<p>We recently stayed at the Skylofts for my friend's 21st birthday and it was one of the best hotel experiences of my life. The service and attention to detail are unparalleled. This is a true five star experience. The staff works very hard to ensure your stay is perfect. Our butler was excellent and the suite was impeccably kept and designed.</p><br>Amazing Suite and Tremendous Service<p>When MGM decided to convert their penthouses that they used for their whales into a separate hotel, Skylofts became one of the best hidden secrets in Las Vegas. The hotel is almost a throwback, as the level of service and attention to detail that is provided is almost unseen in the hospitality business nowadays. The staff is very friendly and attentive and the rooms are spectacular. The two-story living room windows provide a spectacular vista and the bedroom glass wall overlooks the living room. The marble bathroom is spacious and the shower configuration is an almost spa-like experience. Overall this is probably the best suite that you can get in Las Vegas for the dollar.
Room Tip: All of the rooms are the penthouses so it's impossible to get a bad room -it just depends on the...

Everyone we interacted with was polite and courteous. Their willingness to help in any situation or request was exemplary. The Pre-Arrival Coordinator service is always a great sign of a 5-star hotel and the start of an exceptional customer service experience. They took care of all of our needs from specific sodas, teas, snacks and having key lime & chocolate cupcakes with raspberry and topped with ganache for our anniversary upon arrival. I would like to spotlight two employees, Yumi and Eric, who made our stay truly memorable.

Yumi was very personable and friendly. Cognizant of our needs and requests, sometimes before we knew what they were. She took the time to discuss our previous day with us and to offer suggestions of other things we might enjoy. On our next stay, we would definitely request Yumi as our preferred butler and recommend her to all our friends / family.

Eric’s knowledge of restaurants, shows and attractions helped us decided where to go for the best possible experience. He handled all of our requests immediately and professionally going out of his way to make sure we had all the appropriate information.

During our stay, we spoke to quite a few MGM and SkyLofts employees and it was refreshing to hear in every case they all had worked for 8+ years and were very happy with their job and company. It is no wonder that SkyLofts is the best in class in providing an excellent customer experience. Our choice to stay at SkyLofts for our third anniversary was the correct one and all of our future trips to Las Vegas.

Our only hiccup during our stay was when we wanted to order dinner and chocolate soufflé’s from Wolfgang Puck's restaurant which wouldn't allow the desert dishes to leave the restaurant and be served in our loft. That was unacceptable to me and was a surprise to the SkyLofts team as well, which is why we no longer patronize any of his establishments.</p><br>Skylofts baby<p>Amazing. If you have the chance, you should experience the lofts. You will never want to stay anywhere else again. They have 13 different types of pillows, a coffee/expresso machine, water and soda are free in the mini bar, and the orange blankets are the best ever.
Room Tip: The butlers will unpack your luggage, iron your clothes, shine your shoes, and even bring you food f...
