Skylofts win. Hands down actually. Skylofts really is a superior experience, different than other hotels offer. That is my summary.
My long winded version follows:
I booked the trip through American Express Platinum Travel, which I became a member of just to use the travel benefits on this very trip. I highly recommend the Platinum service. With it I had expected to get an upgrade from a 1 BR to 2 BR. Unfortunately even though the website showed availability for two 2 BR lofts and two 3 BR lofts on the day of my arrival I was told that none were available for the 3 days of my stay and that a @ BR loft was only available for the first night. Needless to say a was steaming mad. My wife and I traveled with our friends and really needed a 2 BR room. They were very apologetic but not too helpful in getting the situation resolved. I would have hoped that they would have offered a second room/loft at a deep discount but they had no 1 BR lofts available and didn't offer anything at the MGM. They did offer a room at The Signature, no discount. They were really pleasant, apologetic for the website showing availability they didn't have, but not great at making me happy about the solution. I contacted Platinum Travel and got my final 2 nights in a 2 BR Penthouse Suite, they were great and helpful as always. I will post a review the about the Bellagio as well but do my best to compare the two here.
Other than the major disappointment about only getting one night there, the Skyloft experience was entirely positive. The 2 BR is huge, over the top huge. It would be outstanding to throw a party in. It is very modern and hip, very tasteful. The condition of the space is great, but I suppose you could look at a painted surface here and there and see a small chip. Only the most obsessive people won't be happy with the condition of the space. Layout was great. We had a foosball table we used until late into the morning (drunk foosball has to be better than drunk pool). The master bedroom is fantastic the master bathroom is simply out-of-this-world. The tub is amazing. The steam shower is quite seriously large enough for 10 people. It must be about 12 by 12 feet. Bigger than my college dorm room. The rain head, wall spray and steam combo is uber-relaxing, I found no need for the spa. My wife loved the spa at MGM by the way, smaller than Bellagio by about 50% but very excellent services/staff.
The sound system is awesome as is but is soon to be upgraded to have internet capable multi-function remotes. They give you free movies and internet which is sweet. My buddy played the first 15 seconds of just about every movie including the porn, just to mess with whoever would look at our movie record! It was great listening to my iPhone/iPod throughout the loft. The free non-alcoholic drinks are a huge plus and not to be underappreciated, especially if you are drinking heavily and need to hydrate! Las Vegas tap water stinks BTW, it is undrinkable.
The staff at Skylofts are great, anything to please. They really go the extra mile,
Now to compare, the Bellagio is definitely the best hotel I have ever stayed at. I say that because the Skylofts isn't like any hotel I ever stayed at prior it is like a new experience. The Bellagio room is very traditional, very old-school. 2 bedrooms at either end of a very large space that includes a small bar, living room and dining area. The central space is about 35-40 feet end to end. Big. The bedrooms on wither end are nice and big. There is a master one one end ad the other bedroom is actually an adjoining 1 bedroom hotel room. The adjoining room doesn't have a steam shower, and the bathroom is not quite as deluxe. This is also similar to the Skylofts in that the non-master bathroom had no steam shower and the shower was smaller.
The Bellagio is all marble all the time. Very sweet. Very prim and proper. We had a fountain view and that was essential in my opinion to fully enjoying this room. If you are going to put up this kind of money you deserve to see that awesome fountain show 6-8 times during your stay. We ate at Olives, great meal and wine cellar. The only time I tried the concierge at Bellagio they did drop the ball a bit. I tried to get my complimentary limo back to the airport and the person I talked to didn't seem to think it was included with the suite. They connected me to player services, who weren't all that nice at all. I told them I was looking for my free limo, they said I needed more points ( I had none as we didn;t really gamble there). While waiting on hold with player services, the concierge called back on the other line and said yes we did get a limo to the airport and hooked us up, but the 10--12 minutes with the not-so-nice lady on the other end of the phone was a bit disappointing and unnecessary.

I think the Skylofts really hits the spot for 20-40ish crowds who like their space hip/modern/high tech and fun. Bellagio seems to be going for the more reserved crowd of any age, but seems more pitched at the 40-60 year old base.

The only way the rooms are similarly priced is to get the Skyloft 2 BR as an upgrade (Hooray Platinum travel) but beware the trap I had with internet availability and real world availability being different.

So In my mind Skylofts wins every head to head comparison. Better room, stereo, shower, tub, bar (free stuff always beats expensive minibar), concierge.
Bellagio has a better casino but high minumum bets. The pool is nicer but very reserved/quiet. The MGM pool is much more of a party...we saw guys in costumes, a guy in the Borat suspender/thong bathing suit and lots more 76 ounce beers and frozen drinks 3 feet long. If you want a quiet read by the pool the Bellagio is perfect.
The Bellago fountain is spectacular, wherever you stay in Vegas go watch a show or two, especially at night.
I look forward to another trip to the Skylofts...I may just suck it up and book the 2 BR to make sure I can get it. The upgrade to a 3 BR would be unnecessary but cool.
Hope this makes choosing your hotel easier!</p><br>Luxury with a GREAT staff!<p>Our experience was spot on with all of the other guests who loved their experience.

Being greeted at the airport and driven in a Maybach (my husband loved this) to the friendly and helpful staff, they almost seemed like they were waiting for a challenge or an unusual request!

Our room was lovely and overlooked the strip as per my request..they provided us with an early and late checkout (which we greatly appreciated) everyone on our trip wished my hubby a happy birthday.

I could have stayed in the room the entire trip..the bathroom is the best..from the champagne bubbles in the tub to the enormous shower/sauna.

I was a bit hesitant on what to expect being that it was a hotel within a hotel at the MGM Grand..throw that all out the window because this truly is a spectacular experience!

Was worth every single penny and we cannot wait to go back again!</p><br>Pure Decadence!<p>We flew in from New Orleans, Louisiana. When we arrived at our gate, the MGM driver was waiting for us. He walked us to baggage claim, quickly collected our luggage and escorted us out to the waiting Maybach limo. The Skylofts at MGM Grand was only about a 10-15 minute drive from the airport. We were greeted curbside at the hotel by both the concierge and baggage handler. We were quickly escorted through the lobby and past the VIP check- in area to the private elevators for the Skylofts. We walked down a hallway and noticed a man standing by an open door. This was our room. We were escorted inside the suite, asked to sign papers and given room keys. At this time, we were informed that our AMEX booking agent had arranged for us to be upgraded to a 2 bedroom suite with Butler service. What a wonderful surprise. Our Butler then gave us a full tour of the room and all of its many amenities. The amenities were endless. The huge suite had many flat screen TVs, a few phones, an espresso machine, a game room, a bar, 2 bedrooms, 2 and a half baths, a large dining area, and the list goes on. We needed a tutorial to learn how to use the many remotes that controlled everything from the TVs to the draperies to the air conditioning .

We decided to go to a couple of shows (Ka and O) so, we called the concierge and he arranged tickets for us. Both times we had premium seating (4th row and 6th row) and top-notch treatment at the venue. Both shows were more spectacular than we could have ever imagined. Wow, I guess being Skylofts guests has its advantages. Aside from the shows, we spent a lot of time in our suite. We only left to gamble and shop and to meet friends at a club 2 nights. With all of the amenities and conveniences in the room, we found it ridiculous to leave for little things. Our butler was wonderful and catered to our every need. He even brought us several types of specialty pillows to test and select so that we would be most comfortable while sleeping.

We ordered room service on 3 occasions. Each time, it was delivered at the exact time we had requested and served in our dining area on fine linen and china. The food was hot and delicious every time. Our butler knew from our conversations that I was a coffee and espresso lover. Every morning at 9:00 I would walk downstairs in our suite, and our butler was already busy preparing my morning coffee.

One morning, we had the privilege of dining at the Mansion on the invitation of a friend. You are usually not allowed access to the Mansion unless you are a VIP/Celebrity/High Roller. The food was delicious and reasonably priced.

The Skylofts at MGM Grand provides the most luxurious experience in Las Vegas. When it was time to leave, I actually got teary-eyed. I still miss my butler…lol. No really, I do. We can hardly wait to return to Las Vegas in November for Cigar Afficionado’s Big Smoke at the Venetian. We were originally supposed to stay at the Venetian. Nothing against the Venetian, but we can't keep our minds off Skylofts. I promptly cancelled those reservations and booked our second stay at the Skylofts. The waiting is agony.</p><br>Awesome!<p>From the moment I made the reservation, it was an awesome experience. The staff during our stay really made our trip great - Regina, Sherman and Valerie were fantastic. Soon I will start planning my trip for next year!</p><br>Probably the best place I've ever stayed<p>Just returned from a five night Vegas break where I spent two nights at the Skylofts and three at the Bellagio. I wish I could have spent all five at the Skylofts, it was that good. Although we weren't lucky enough to get a ride in the Maybach, we were whisked to the Skylofts entrance from the airport in a matter of minutes. You check-in in your room, no queues, and all the amenities (& gadgets) are explained to you. The double height windows are fantastic and give the whole loft a feeling of being much bigger than it actually is. Bang & Olufsen audio and visual systems are fitted all over, and you can control your iPod from whereever you are. Soft drinks and water are free (unlike the Bellagio where you daren't breathe on your fridge for fear of being charged) as is the wi-fi (Bellagio - $15 per day!). The butlers are great and will organise anything and take you anywhere. Sure, you have to tip them, but you feel it's worth it, and you really do feel like a high-roller, even if you're just treating yourself. I would go back there in a flash. Final word, it's even (slightly) cheaper than a fountain view suite at the Bellagio, and even if the casino at the MGM grand isn't the best, you'ld be crazy not to visit here.</p><br>Great lofts, pity about the hotel<p>The Skylofts are great - fantastic amount of space, contemporary design, spectacular views, just so Vegas. Perfect for a family or group of friends travelling together. The staff who look after one there are also terrific. The pool table in our lift was a wonderful touch.

While the Skylofts are marketed separately from the MGM Grand, they can't escape being part of the hotel. And the hotel is rather run down and not of the quality of, for example, the Bellagio or Venetian. On arrival, one comes in through a special Skylofts entrance. But that only lasts a few yards. One then has to navigate the the MGM lobby (think Grand Central Station in the rush hour) to reach the lifts. More problematic is the swimming pools - the Skylofts share the MGM pools, which are very crowded and dirty, with some of the most unpleasant staff that I have come across in a hotel in years.</p><br>Still our favorite place to stay in Vegas<p>My wife and I recently returned from a three night stay at the Skylofts. Having stayed once before a couple of years ago, we had some hesitation based on a few reviews mentioning the condition of the rooms. We had no problems with either the cleanliness or condition of the room. As beautiful as before. I noted that the Creston system in the living room had been updated.

We stayed on the Mobil 5 Star package and had an amazing time. We had so much scheduled that we probably saved enough on gambling to pay for the splurge.

The staff treated us very well. There has been mention of stuffiness but we are very casual, not formal people and the staff was friendly and responded in kind. We were provided with a very detailed itinerary prior to our arrival and everything went without a hitch.

We had some concerns about the heat going this time of year but found that between all the extra time spent in the amazing room, all the activities we had planned and all the available restaurants etc. within the MGM, we only went outside once. That trip was to check out the new Encore. We were underwhelmed with it and quickly went back to our retreat at the Skylofts.

As the restaurant included in the package was closed for the month, we were allowed to use the credit at any restaurant in the hotel. This turned out very well. We ate at a different excellent restaurant each night and enjoyed them all.

The Ka backstage experience and their treatment of us was a blast. We have a great picture of us in an action pose with the man characters of the show. Seats were 6th row center. Amazing.

Everyone should take advantage of the chance to visit the Mansion. Such an oasis of calm amidst all the chaos that is Vegas. Food is great as well.

We will definately return when the schedule and budget combine to allow it!</p><br>One Thumb Up...One Thumb Down<p>TRIP: July 19-23

Lucky for us the SkyLOFTS had not been completely booked when we made our reservation 8 months in advance. We were planning a family trip for 10 people and wanted to have accommodations where we had a place to eat, visit and play comfortably. The LOFTS were perfect for our needs. I won't go on and on about the LOFT accommodations because so many other trip reports have done such a good job.

We were greated right at our exit gate by a SkyLOFT employee who walked us down to the baggage claim, collected our baggage and escorted us out to where the Maybach was waiting, along with the gold stretch limo for our overflow of family. The attendants were more than helpful. The Maybach was a special treat. There were lots of gadgets to play with and VOSS water chilled in the refrigerator. It was fun for our children....none of us will ever ride in a car like this again I'm quite sure of that.

TIP: Be sure to plan tipping into your vacation budget. There are lots of service people to take care of if you choose to do that.

Our stay at the LOFTS would have been a lot more pleasant had we not been badgered every single day to see the front desk about the balance of our bill. This was extremely annoying. I was planning to take care of our bill at the end of our stay.

I would imagine the LOFT was pretty special early on. I had read many, many trip reviews and many of the special details that were mentioned in trip reports from years ago simply did not exist anymore. I'm guessing it's the economy. They have to cut back somewhere. I will say that our loft was sadly in need of some repair. The paint was cracked and peeling on the trim in the bathroom and as another person reported, the handles in the shower were broken and fell off onto the floor. They did try to fix this while we were there. I was annoyed...what were we paying $700 a night for? I suppose I just expected more from a place that is considered 5 diamond.

Skylofts boast about their special attention to detail and offer concierge services for whatever your needs may be. Due to the fact that I had planned our trip throughly over the course of about eight months, I felt confident that all of our requests would be taken care of. A quick double check before we arrived eased my mind a little.

Long story short, many of our specific requests had not been taken care of prior to our arrival. A couple of those screw ups were....

Our anniversary cake was not the flavors we had ordered....nonetheless it was spectacular....but disappointing in the same bite. I wonder why they even bother asking when they are going to choose for you?

Our nightclub VIP reservations were nonexistant upon arrival at the Playboy Club...which started our nightclub experience out on a bad note.....only getting worse as the night went on. I was sadly disappointed at the lack of attention to detail by our concierge, Valerie. You can see my trip report about The Playboy Club on TripAdvisor as well. I will never spend another dime there as long as I live thanks to Valerie and Pasquale Romono, the concierge from Playboy.

Just about everything we planned ON OUR OWN outside of the LOFT accommodations, went through without a hitch. All scheduled limos were on time, show tickets were waiting at the box offices, excursions went smoothly. Just about everything we planned throught he LOFT concierge was messed up somehow.

One thing that really irritated my husband was the fact that they kept calling him Mr. Pratt. My name is Mrs. Pratt but when we got married I did not take his name. He has a different last name and I specifically told our concierge this in three different emails. She responded that she was glad to know that detail so they could address my husband properly. Right off the bat everyone called him by my last name. I mentioned this several times to the service people and the concierge but it continued throughout the 5 days we were there. I have often wondered since our trip if we were someone of importance if this would have happened continuously throughout our stay.

ON A MORE POSITIVE NOTE:
We rented a cabana at the MGM pool. If you EVER have a chance to do this I highly recommend it. It was $250 for the day (10-5). We had a phone, TV, stocked refrigerator (colas, water, and snacks) innertubes to use on the lazy river, and comfy couches. We had a range of ages there that day..from 13 to 72. We all enjoyed it. I'm not a sun person so reading a good book in the cabana's shade was fine with me.

My husband thoroughly enjoyed his spa experience. The spa is really beautiful and there are services you can use even if you don't want a massage. We had a $100 gift certificate in our LOFT package - can't get better than that.

Breakfast for 4 was also included in our LOFT package. They called it a continental breakfast but it was hardly that. It was much more!! Fresh croissants and rolls, cereal, fruit, yogurt, juice, hot chocolate.....I was really impressed with this "free" continental breakfast that cost us $20 each day. Seriously, if they offer you a free breakfast, it really should be free. The breakfast was awesome and came to $100 each day - that part was free - what was not free was the 20% handling fee/gratuity. Nonetheless it was very tasty!!

OUR FAVORITE PART: My husband and I chose to have breakfast one morning at The Mansion. I have to say this was the best breakfast I have ever had in my life. The Mansion is located in the MGM and it's hidden. It's the place where the truly elite stay. We're only allowed to eat there..LOL. I had steak and eggs. I've heard people say that their steak melted in their mouth...never believed it....now I do. This was the best steak I've ever had. My juice was freshly squeezed apple juice.....it looked a little gross so I was hesitant....it tasted heavenly. My husband had eggs benedict with caviar. He loved it. The bill, $140 for two....a little high but well worth it.

All in all I will probably never stay at the LOFTS again. I felt as if perhaps we were "somebody" or "a celebrity" we may have been treated differently. I didn't like the stuffy air about the place. And the many screw ups by the concierge has led me to believe you don't always get what you pay for.

What disappointed me most was that since we did have such a large party, the LOFT's attention to detail was important to me. I didn't want to have to double check THEM on doing THEIR job and most certainly didn't want to expect a day to be planned only to find out it's not and then have chaos.

MY personal vacation was ruined by their lack of ability. I chose the LOFTS for that purpose, to help me enjoy myself while I was there and not to have to worry about the details. That didn't happen.</p><br>Amazing price, amazing stay.<p>Every Summer my father (age 44) takes me (age 13) and my sister (age 10) on a 4 day vacation. This year we chose to go to Las Vegas. When we came off our plane, an employe greeted us and took our bags for us, then transporting us to our hotel in a $300,000 Maybok. Beautiful interroir and very luxurious. The Skylofts had their own seprate entrance, apart from the MGM Grand. They offered us free beverages and were very kind. Also apart from the MGM we had our on elevators which were much for nicer than the MGM elevators. When we exited the elevators, at the top floor, there was another lobby, and three hallways leading to diffrent lofts.
Cons: We were expecting a 2 bedroom loft, but instead got a 2 bedroom loft converted to a three bedroom loft. It was very nice but there was no family room with a t.v to watch movies. We ended up getting swtiched the next night to a 2 bedroom loft the same size.
Pros: Every loft has a 24/7 butler who is available at the push of a button. Every morning my family would order breakfast for $25 a person, we enjoyed it in our dining room. Our bar fridge was stocked with free beverages, but the snacks were not free. Also all the movies were free and i enjoyed a few in my infinity bathtub in my ensuite. My family loved the desgin on the lofts, the decor, the staff and our experince in Las Vegas.
I highly recommend the Skylofts at the MGM Grand to anyone.</p><br>Amazing Amazing Amazing Amazing. Did I say amazing?<p>There really are no words to explain how amazing the Skylofts at MGM Grand truly are. I've stayed at the high-end properties in Las Vegas, from the Wynn, to the Bellagio, to the Four Seasons, and would never in my life stay anywhere but the Skylofts if it were up to me. I have now stayed at this property twice, and both stays were amazing. I decided on booking my room through American Express's Platinum Travel service, which partners with the Skylofts as part of their Fine Hotel and Resort program. This entitled me to a 10% discount, room upgrade if available, guaranteed 4PM check-out, complimentary continental breakfast for each day of my staff, and $100 spa credit. The room rate for my booked 1 bedroom loft was under $500 with tax, and I was excited to surprise my partner with our stay at the Skylofts.

We drove from Los Angeles to Las Vegas, and arrived at the MGM Grand without problem. Upon entering the property, I gave the Skylofts a call (per their instructions) to ensure someone would be able to meet me at the entrance. Prior to arriving, I had been contacted by the hotel's pre-arrivial coordinator, who helped me book dinner reservations, show reservations, and spa services. She was very helpful, and was definitely able to pull strings that I know I could not have pulled myself. Upon arriving at the Skylofts entrance (the Skylofts has its own private entrance separate from the main MGM Grand entrance), I was met by two staff members, who offered to helped me with my bags. We were escorted through the private Skylofts entrance, past the MGM Grand lobby, into the Skylofts VIP area, and up the private elevators to the MGM Grand's 29th floor. The Skylofts common area is beautifully decorated, very quiet, and makes you feel as if you truly are a VIP. We were taken to our two-bedroom loft (we were upgraded for free because of the American Express booking), which was the most jaw-dropping room I have ever been in. I counted; there were ten plasma televisions, probably eighteen phones throughout the room, and perhaps a half-dozen remote control units that could control the drapery, climate, television,and music. The room was a two-bedroom, two and a half-bath loft, and must have been, roughly 3,000 square feet. Our concierge did the quick paperwork to check us in, and we were given complimentary juices by our butler. Our butler gave us a tour of the room, spent a good 30 minutes showing us every little detail, and had a great sense of humor about everything.

Everything in the room was perfect. All the electronics worked, the climate control was prompt, and the concierge was only one button away. I was a little concerned that there was only one button on the phone, but soon realized the concierge could handle everything from room service, to show tickets, to having my car ready. We ordered a quick lunch, which was delivered promptly and was both delicious and very reasonably priced. All the movies, adult films, and internet were free, and we had a great time watching different movies in different rooms (we literally had to call each other a few times because the room was so large). Other nice touches were the amazing steam shower, infinity tub, and "dream butler" (along with the room service menu is a menu for different kinds of pillows, which a nice gentleman brought in and let us test for an optimal sleeping experience). I chose a water-filled one, which was incredibly nice.

We decided to ask the concierge to get us show tickets to Cirque Du Soleil's Zumanity for that night's performance, and were amazed to find out we were in the 7th row, and our tickets were heavily discounted. Upon returning to the room, we found a nice dessert left for us, and cute little quotes on our bed to inspire the day. Truly, there is nothing I would change about that room. It was amazing.

The next morning, we opted to eat breakfast at The Mansion. The Mansion is an invite-only portion of the MGM Grand, with a few dozen villas for the richest of the rich. Other than paying $5,000 a night for a villa through a service like American Express or Virtuoso, The Mansion can only be accessed if you are invited (high roller, celebrity), though the Skylofts gives you access to their Estate Dining Room for breakfast. Our butler escorted us to The Mansion, and we were seated on the patio. There was only one other gentleman eating there, and we were waited on very promptly. The food was DELICIOUS and, quite honestly, still reasonably priced (we ordered a mimosa, orange juice, pancakes, and bagels and lox, and with tip, the total was under $50). The restaurant manager offered to let us walk around The Mansion, which was a nice treat as it is somewhere that most people will never get to see. It truly is beautiful, and reminds me more of a high-end apartment complex than hotel.

My friend took advantage of our $100 spa credit, and used it at the MGM Grand Spa. In the meantime, I went back to the room, had a nice chat with my butler, and enjoyed the steam shower. While hanging out in the 29th floor's common area, I saw few other guests come in and out, though I did see a handful of celebrities (the Jonas Brothers, Jennifer Lopez, and a guy I had seen in movies but had no idea who he was). Upon returning to my room, even at this early hour, I found it cleaned and re-stocked with our choice beverages (Voss Water, Dr. Pepper), all of which were free.

I was so sad to leave the Skylofts, especially to go to *gasp* the Wynn. The Skylofts handled every request with a smile and success, whereas the Wynn nickle-and-dimed me for anything and everything. Anyone who has a negative comment about the Skylofts should really have their head checked.</p><br></body></html>
