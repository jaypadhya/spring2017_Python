The freezer door didn't shut which allowed the freezer to fill with ice/frost. This plugged the vents between the freezer and refrigerator so the refrigerator stayed at room temperature. We couldn't chill anything. The kitchen was stocked with 1 plate, 1 glass, 2 cups and 2 saucers. Not really ready for 2 people to make it "like home". There were no paper towels, napkins, tissues, etc. The hotel was sold out so we had not opportunity to request a different room.
Room Tip: Check for functioning appliances before you unpack.

We were very prepared for the short-comings, and overall had a very positive experience, we would definitely stay here again, and recommend it to reasonable people (you are getting more than you pay for with this choice). We came during the week, so were able to have a non-smoking room. There were multiple issues, but all were minor, manageable and resolved to our satisfaction - we were perfectly content with this hotel as a choice, it's location only a few blocks to the strip really was unparalleled, considering we didn't have to pay the $20/$25 per day "resort fee" that the hotels on the strip charge... Having the suite with kitchen saved us on our meals costs, too. We also booked through Priceline. The reservation didn't show up initially, I called ahead twice to confirm the booking, because I didn't want a problem when we arrived in the middle of the night, by the second call, they located our reservation (not sure if it was just a timing issue). PS also, it's hard to see from the photos, but just to let you know there IS a small hot tub as well as a pool - but we didn't have time to use either. Maria that works the night shift was awesome. Thanks Maria!</p><br>Great room<p>I arrived before check in time.. They let me in early. The staff was very friendly and accommodating, I have stayed at this property several times before. This was the best stay yet; Room was in good repair and clean. The TVs (2 of them) worked great, what a great low price for a small apartment. I stayed 15 days with no problems or hassles. Overall a really good experience.</p><br>Very tired hotel<p>The hotel has a good location but the rooms are worst than camping out. Everything old, mismatched, soiled, need of repair...kinda like going to Goodwill for a room. Had to take a smoking room that reeked of smoke, had no choice.
Room Tip: Don't expect anything but a room. Go to the casinos

The hotel is very clean, comfortable, and inviting everyone is very friendly. I guarantee you will like this place.</p><br>Horrible<p>It was the worse experience I have ever had in a room, and customer service.

We ordered our vacation pkg through Priceline, with our flight tickets. I checked online, looked at the pics, and also read reviews, they looked good, but, I didn't realize that there was more then one of these in Las Vegas. So I booked it expecting it to be nice, clean room. When we got to our room, after carry our bags up a flight stairs to the 2nd floor, the room smell was so bad with stale smoke that I could hardly breathe when I walked in. I even started wheezing, and feeling sick to my stomach.

When we called to say this was not what we were exoecting, and it smelled so horrible that we could hardly stand being in the room, they said they were really sorry, but they were full for the weekend. But to check back the next day. (The parking lot was not full, at all.) Reluctantly, we spend the night, the pillows and bedding reeked so bad that it was horrible! My clothes smelled so bad from just being in the room, it smelled like I was a smoker, and my pajama's reeked so bad from being in the bed, that when I smelled them, I almost threw up.

When we went down the next morning to see if another room had become available, they said that they were really sorry again, but, no, there were no none smoking rooms available. And she added that this is the room the Priceline automatically gives you when you book a vacation through them, so they blamed Priceline! Do they have anything to do with this pkg! Were we not in their care? Unbelievable! She said when housekeeping became available, (they were swamped right now), that they would send them to wash walls, and spray something, and to put a ozone thing in to collect all the bad air, and clean it. We had to be gone out of the room for hours for them to do that. They said they did the air, but, when we came back, it still reeked of smoke, and there was no evidence of housekeeping ever coming to our room for the whole weekend. Our bed was never made, we asked for clean bedding, that they never put on the bed. never checked on our towel situation, had one little sample of coffee, never refilled that, so that we could even make coffee in the room. We had to ask for simple things like soap to wash with, and shampoo. It was the worse experience, and customer service that I have ever had in a room, ever. We will never stay there again.
Room Tip: I will never go back! Dirty, reeked of smoke, customer service was lacking in every way. Not even...

I think I saw a better rate for the same brand more centrally located to city enter.</p><br>Decent inexpensive stay<p>If you are looking for a budget friendly motel, you should stay at this motel.
Rooms are large and relatively clean. Each suite includes a living room with a kitchenette and a bedroom.
Laundry is available onsite, the pool is small but clean and inviting. As the name suggests, it is meant for longer stays but they do accept nightly guests.
Location is OK but there are no restaurants close by. Reception is not open 24/7.</p><br>Better than last time.<p>I visited this hotel a few years ago and wrote a review. Last time, the air conditioner sucked. This time, it was powerful and as cold as I wanted. The room was clean and quiet. The hotel manager lady was very professional. There are at least 2 flat screen TV's per suite. The bedroom is separated from the living room. I will definitely stay here again.
Room Tip: As with any hotel, ask for a quiet room. As with any hotel with a door exposed to the outside, ask...
See more room tips</p><br>To be an Extended Stay it is far to costly<p>They should consider that they are a long term hotel/apartment and price it accordingly. While staying there, within a 10 month period the rent was raised twice, the pool was shut down for about three months and they over charge in the laundry room. I started going out to a laundry matt.</p><br></body></html>
