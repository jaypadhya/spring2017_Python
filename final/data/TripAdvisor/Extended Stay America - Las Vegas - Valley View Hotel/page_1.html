<html><head><h3>Extended Stay America - Las Vegas - Valley View Hotel Reviews Page 1</h3></head><body><br>it was perfect for our stay<p>The room is an extended stay. If you are good with limited service and a lot of DIY, this is the place for you. We required towels and an ashtray (brought to us quickly) along with a full kitchen set.

Place is really close to the strip (we had children with us so we did'n't want the typical vegas experience....

Room was very big, full living room, kitchenette (full fridge) decent sized bedroom...bathroom was a bit small...everything worked well...fridge was too cold and froze some stuff...couldn't figure out how to turn it down...

we cooked full meals there, it was quiet, safe and had everything we needed.

no extended stay does housekeeping (without you pay for it) but I find they show up at the worst times anyhow, so we're good with that...was a good place to stay for our family -- if we happen to go to vegas again I'd stay again...and I'd recommend it to others.</p><br>What kitchen in your room?<p>This property is bit old but decent (im comparing with Extended stay, Bellevue, WA) Though its 1+ mile from the strip, its calm surrounding. My wife and i went for 4 days trip to Vegas. She wanted a hotel room along with kitchen, which made our life easy for home made food and without missing fun in the sin city (utensils provided in front desk). The staff were very helpful at all times. I know most of the bus tour doesn't pick up from this hotel, you can go to the closest hotel for pickup (Palms, Gold Coast).
Room Tip: Top floor would be good. Lift is available

I liked the location and that the room has a kitchenette. The room I booked this time was the two bedroom suite. I arrived at around 9pm, checked in, got ready for bed, and went to sleep. During my conference the next day, I discovered that I had about 25 bites on my face, fingers and body that were very itchy. When I returned to the hotel, I let Elix, the manager on duty know. He came to the room & looked at the bed. He peeled back the sheets & didn't see anything. He said that he would get pest control to inspect the bed & that the hotel takes issues like this very seriously. He also said that I could be having an allergic reaction to something. The hotel was fully booked for my second night, so he couldn't move me until my last night. My second night I slept on the uncomfortable pull out sofa in the other room. The next day at my conference the bites were making it hard for me to sit for several hours. I'll just say I was very uncomfortable. Elix called & left me a message during my conference. When I returned his call, I was very upset. I told Elix that I was upset that he said that I may have an allergic reaction, when obviously I had bed bug bites. Elix was apologetic & informed me that pest control came to inspect the bed & did find bed bugs. He also informed me that I would not be charged for my stay & the issue was reported to the insurance company to cover incidentals. Although, I was upset, I felt that Elix handled this issue to the best of his ability & authority. I do feel that great customer service would have been to offer a free 1 or 2 night stay in the future. I would have much rather paid for my stay & not have had to deal with all of the stress of getting bitten by bed bugs & the stress of bringing them into my apartment complex.
I washed all of my clothes in hot water & threw away the suitcases. The only thing I wanted replaced were my suitcases. After a week of not hearing anything from Extended Stay, I called & spoke to Alexandra, the general manager. She assured me that she would call the insurance company & make sure that they called me that week. It has been a month, no has called me. I have called Extended Stay Valley View twice more. Elix did call me back once & told me that if Alexandra said that she would take care of it, she would. But still no word from Alexandra or the insurance company. I do not appreciate being lied to.
When I was checking in, there were 3 young men ahead of me in line. They had a reservation through Booking.com that was not in the Extended Stay computer. The hotel was fully booked. They were out of luck...or were they? Perhaps not staying at Extended Stay Valley View saved them all from getting bed bugs.
I do not think that was the first time that that hotel had bed bugs. The bed was brand new. I think that there was a problem before, they tried to get rid of the problem and through me getting bed bug bites, found out that the problem was not taken care of. I feel that I have been more than fair in this review.</p><br>Alex Nunez is the best!!!<p>As a researcher I have to admit that Exetended stay in valley view boulevard is one of the best hotels ever! The employees are extremely professional and very helpful! I want to thank the Assistant General Manager Alex Nunez for all his help and his excellent attitude and manner! He is the ultimate professional and always goes the extra mile! Terry also at the front desk is very professional and always smiles. The rooms are clean and the breakfast is amazing! I would highly recommend this hotel to any visitor as you will really enjoy your stay and you will feel home!!!!</p><br>ROACH HOTEL<p>These people should be ashamed of themselves for renting rooms out like this. This room had hug roaches crawling around, dirty room, floors, and the sofa sleeper was just nasty. So unsanitary! I had my grandsons with me who are 8 and 4 and my wheelchair bound daughter ( they had zero accessibility) who likes to sit and play on the floor, not in this place! Unless you want them to enjoy the little friends crawling around. When we called and complained all they said was that they could switch our rooms as if the other rooms would not be in the same condition. Needless to say we did not stay nor did they even try to find us another room. Oh but they did say it would take 5 to 10 days to get my money back. Never never never go there you have been warned. Now time to call the department health and the American disability foundation.</p><br>EMPLOYEES ROB YOUR ROOM! DONT STAY HERE!!!<p>Our room was robbed while we were at a wedding, they stole a laptop, camera, wifi hotspot, tablet, ipod, rummaged threw all of our suitcases and took my wallet with $500 cash,cigars, a drivers license, and then took a shower using our stuff. the manager read the door key but wouldnt tell us anything, 3 days later after having to harass them , they told us that it was an employee key used to get into our room. we were robbed by one their employees. we are still in the process of getting our stuff back. but save yourself the hassle, and don't stay there!
Room Tip: Don't choose this place
See more room tips</p><br>Cheap but not worth the savings<p>We actually choose this property only because the "big fight" was in Vegas this weekend. We found this hotel extremly dismal, the bed was clean, the room wreaked of stale smoke (we bought air freshener). The pool was pleasant and the staff was friendly (except the manager who was extremely unprofessional to the staff). The sidewalks were stained from spills that hadn't been washed away and one area was puddled and left to form a slippery slimmy something....I wouldn't consider any Extended Stay because of this experience. There were no dishes, pans or utensils of any kind which was different than any other extended stay chain that we've stayed in.
Room Tip: If you decide to stay here ask for an interior room closer to the pool (it would be a little quieter...

Room Tip: Try rooms at ground level.
See more room tips</p><br>Excellent Value<p>Friendly, helpful desk staff. 4-dot rating I've given it is based on the caliber of this motel and the low price we paid...it ain't the Hilton but it served us well for two nights. Was here for the NAB convention and just needed a decent place. It's close to, but west of the Strip.

It's truly a suite with a large, separate bedroom and a second large room with a convertible, pullout sofa-bed. Has a large fridge and microwave. This room would be great for a family. Bathroom acceptable. Lighting good. I'm guessing this room was remodeled because everything was in good shape.

The strangest thing is that when you first enter the room, the only thing there for you are a couple towels--not even any soap, washcloths, or drinking cups. Nor was any of this stuff offered upon check-in. So be sure to ask for what you think you'll need when you check in.

The free breakfast is pathetic, and there's not even a place to sit down; it's grab-and-go for the few items they have. Tip: walk (under a mile) or drive across the street to the Gold Coast for the excellent breakfast buffet (only meal I tried there) for $8 ($7 if you get their free gambler's club card). Have wonderful cooked to order omelets, plus a huge variety of everything else.

When I could get it to work, internet worked well. Mostly used my cellular service. The swimming pool looked nice.

I do recommend this place if you're seeking a good, roomy, economy place. There was free parking and no stupid resort fee.
Room Tip: Ask for a remodeled room.
See more room tips</p><br>Not Pleased<p>We have stayed in Extended Stays before & was surprised at the poor condition of this place. Paid for king suite & got 2 double beds. We had only 2 towels, then we had no cooking utensils, had to call front desk 2 times. Parking is terribly tight due to many oversized trucks. Its in a business/commercial district. Did not feel real safe to walk around. Finally used the pool with caution, it was OK. The front desk did try to be helpful.</p><br></body></html>
