<html><head><h3>Extended Stay America - Las Vegas - Valley View Hotel Reviews Page 6</h3></head><body><br>My stay was comfortable and relaxing.<p>my room was meticulously clean, and when my shower had issues, tony was friendly and fast in his repairs, overall a recommended lodging in all regards, the staff was friendly and helpful, they had valuable insight into the local attractions, and the nightlife, and always had a kind word for the customers</p><br>Great Service for the Money<p>This is an extended stay hotel, a lot of construction workers, etc. It was clean, all two-room suites and quiet. The best part is the staff. They are fun and very helpful. My daughter fell in love with the desk clerk Roger and his million dollar smile. They are located right by the Palms and the Rio and you can walk 5 minutes to Caeser';s Palace and the strip. This is not a hotel with room service, etc. but each suite has a full kitchen and a separate bedroom. Almost a miniature apartment and well worth the value. We'll stay again.</p><br>Great for families!!! Great service!<p>If you are traveling with a family this is the hotel for you. The rates were great and very affordable especially for a family of 4 on a budget. The rooms were super clean and well stocked. The staff was super friendly and knowledgeable. My youngest doesn't due well in car rides and when I walked in to the hotel he would not stop crying, but the gentlemen at the front deak named Roger not only helped us quickly but the screaming kid on my hip didnt even bother him. And not only that he went out of his way and made my son a paper airplane to cheer him up. He immediately stopped crying, I was so impressed by this gentlemen's customer service. I know I wouldn't have received this level of personal care and attention at one of the over priced hotels on the strip. I couldnt be happier with my trip and the service I received. Thank you to all the staff at extended stay for making my vacation that much better.</p><br>Home away from home<p>If you are visiting Las Vegas and looking for a great clean hotel with excellent customer service. It is a must you book your long or short term stay at Extended Stay America - Valley View.

It is the best home away from home experience. Through out the years when my family and I are in Vegas, we have peace of mind to stay at Extended Stays - Valley View. It is complete with high speed wireless access to conduct your business and also has a gym, pool and laundry facility if needed. The staff are very helpful and pro active. Along with the manager and the rest of the team, Roger has always been very helpful with everything. What more could you ask for? I highly recommend this hotel for your personal, business or even family 2nd home in the Vegas area.

Colleen Sevilla</p><br>Best Hotel to stay at off of the strip hands down!<p>I live in Cali and came down to Vegas to celebrate my bday. I had a budget to work with and found that Extended Stay had a great rate to stay per night so i decided to give this hotel a chance. Im so glad i chose this hotel. First off the front staff, especially an employee by the name of Roger, were just simply so amazing, efficient, and extremely friendly. They made me feel right at home! Roger even recommend me to see their top shows they have in Vegas which i went to go see the Blue Man Group and man was that show so awesome! Also anytime i needed anything they were quick to get it done. Second, the cleaniness of the rooms were really good. When i got to my room everthing was in order and clean. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone coming down to Vegas!</p><br>Amazing home away from home<p>I am a traveling nurse from Indiana and Vegas was my first travel assignment. Although it was so hard to be away from my family during the holidays (november 10th through Jan 7th) I felt like I had a family here. Roger, Mike, Teri and Elix were the most amazing staff. I'm going to miss them. They were always there for me when I needed a cab, or limo, or change for the laundry and even every time I needed something printed off or faxed. At times when I was lonely I would just go down and chat for a few minutes.
The housekeepers were amazing as well. (I don't know them by name but they were always very efficient and friendly)
Your warm pool and the hot tub were my best friend.
Thank you so much for the hospitality during my visit to Las Vegas. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting this city.
Blessings,

Room Tip: The room with the view to the Palms and the pool was the best view room 3203

Everything about this extended stay is awesome from the staff to the ammenities. One reason for choosing this location was because it is pet friendly. On a couple occasions our dog Connor escaped from the room and was roaming lost, thanks to all the amazing people who work here, our dog was able to hang out at the front desk until we got home from work! The rooms are very clean and spacious which is a huge plus when you are traveling and staying for long periods of time. Free wifi, pool/spa, onsite laundry, and gym! Did I mention is close to the strip. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone comming to las vegas whether its for business or pleasure, long or short term.
Room Tip: Rooms facing the pool are the best.

Roger was a big help at the front desk, taking care of all our needs. Plenty of clean towels and lots of hot water. Would stay again at this Extended Stay.
Room Tip: Hotel is very quiet. My room faced the pool with lots of palm trees; very nice view.
