<html><head><h3>Extended Stay America - Las Vegas - Valley View Hotel Reviews Page 3</h3></head><body><br>Gone downhill in the past year<p>My previous review was 4 stars but I stayed here for a second time for 10 days in April 2014 on another hiking trip and feel like the place has gone downhill. To start with I specifically requested a room NOT facing the Palms on my reservation and never got one. I tried multiple days to switch rooms and every time I checked the person working in the morning would tell me a room was available and would be held for me to come back for the key at 3 PM once it was clean. When I checked back at 3 PM I was told each time that there were no rooms and they had no idea what the morning person was talking about to check again in the morning. The night staff I found to be pretty useless while daytime staff is excellent and very helpful especially Roger (think that was his name had a handlebar mustache). My room smelled horribly like cigarettes and every night I would wake up and smell cigarette smoke coming in through both the bathroom fan and plumbing from other rooms. I've had to wash everything I brought with me multiple times now to alleviate the cigarette smell now that I'm back home.

In the area of my room there were several people living here that seem to do nothing but smoke and drink on the stairs all day long. Whenever I went downstairs to leave or up to my room they would complain for me to use the elevator because they had to pick up their drinks and cigarettes to let me by and one even mumbled "are you kidding me" under her breathe because she had to stand up. On April 4, 2014 night there was a group of people sitting on a couch with a fire burning in the parking lot until well after midnight having a loud, extremely vulgar, drunken party which security apparently did not mind.

I went to Death Valley for half of my trip or else I would have checked out of this place after the second night and will avoid it in the future. If you do not smoke and drink constantly this is not the place for you. The location is perfect and price is good but I would rather drive another mile or two and pay more than stay here again.</p><br>decided to stay indefinitely<p>I have read many of the reviews here and frankly I have not had these issues. I decided awhile back that instead of going all out and renting an apt or home that I would stay at the extended stay indefinitely because frankly it is monetarily right now for me that best way to save some cash while I get back on my feet again. I have a dog and once a few things were worked out I have the same housekeeper every Saturday and so far have had no issues because she and my dog get along. I have also discovered because I have been here almost a year that I like the place and if I have any issues at all I go to the manager and Elix takes care of it. If I see safety issues or anything like that I let them know. I even get boxes sent here periodically and sometimes have issues but always get it worked out. Stopped up sink or anything usually gets done in 24 hours. Sure there is NO PLACE PERFECT but all in all I am okay with it so far.</p><br>Disappointed<p>There was only one staff member who was kind, Terry. There was dried vomit near the bedside. The toaster did not work. And the door-lock was loose.

The arrival staff members not very friendly...and when I asked for them to clean the vomit...they were a no show...ewwww!</p><br>ALL IT NEEDED WAS CLEANING<p>The room we had was nice and comfortable. What made the room good was the kitchen facility, it has stove! and some pans and plates!
There were two things, MAJOR thing they need to do: CLEAN THE SOFA BED. CHANGE THE MATTRESS! Please to the people at ESH: Pls take heed of this comment: clean your facilities.
The reception person was nice and helpful and friendly. ALL THEY NEED TO DO IS CLEAN AND CHANGE OLD,WORN OUT THINGS IN THE ROOM.
Room Tip: Bring extra blankets.

We liked that hotel very close to the orleans arena, we were there for our daughters JAMZ Nationals. Breakfast not kid friendly they need milk n oj maybe cereal.</p><br>Much better than On The Strip!!<p>I chose to stay at this Extended Stay in a 2 BR suite with a full kitchen for less money than a room at the Rio Suites where the convention I was attending was being held. The room was just average--not plush like a 4 star hotel, but the beds were good, the space was comfortable for 4 or 5, and it was wonderful parking right next to our room rather than walking a mile through a smokey casino. The breakfast provided by the hotel was instant oatmeal, granola bars, packaged muffins and apples and oranges--great to grab and go. We utilized the stove and the full size refrigerator. No dishwasher or disposal, and our sink drained slow, but the hotel staff was very quick to respond to every request. Flat screen TV's in all 3 rooms. Internet wasn't real fast but it worked and was FREE. LARGE closets in the bedrooms and hallway.</p><br>Stayed here over New Years<p>First, I didn't book or pay for this room, so I can't speak to the actual value - but I gather it was quite good. Me, wife and daughter stayed here for about a week. Overall the place suited us nicely - but you have to know what you get and don't get here. First, there is no maid service unless you pay for it separately (I think $10/service but we never did) so keep that in mind when you stay there. You need to keep your own place clean, but that's not really a problem.

Next, as to location, it's just a bit south of the Rio and not far off the Strip at Flamingo. Actually, we didn't spend any time on the Strip anyway. I went to the Rio a couple nights just for a little bit. Mostly the trip was a family get-together as my bro-in-law lives there.

The room itself was great for our needs - 2 queen beds in a separate room from the front room, which has a couch (probably a fold-out but our daughter preferred to sleep in it as a couch anyway). Bathroom was standard - maybe a little substandard but adequate and not dirty. Had a full size fridge and stove in the outer room too - didn't use it much but we stored Milk, water and soda in there which was convenient. Expect to make a trip to the grocery store, though they have basic kitchenware (we opted to buy disposable cups/bowls - and also bought toilet paper and paper towels for our stay. TP runs out quick so good to have some on hand).

The area is a bit deserted but didn't seem dangerous or anything like that. The room upstairs must have had a kid because during the day we could hear him romping about annoyingly, but it stopped at night time so it didn't really disturb us. We had no interaction with the staff at all, so I can't say good or bad about them.

All in all, a good choice if this sort of room is your style. It's no Hilton, but you won't feel cheated either. Need to have a rental car though to get around - I wouldn't stay here without one.
Room Tip: No real tips for good rooms - choose one without kids above you maybe? Noise wasn't an issue th...

The last straw was to find how slow the advertised free wifi was only to be presented with an upgrade speed at considerable cost. Decent location.</p><br>Next week will be 13 weeks here!<p>I leave next week.
As you all know I do travel nursing night shift in ICU. I want to tell you all this is a perfect location right on Flamingo. The 202East bus will take you to the Strip in 5 min.
Stay here. It is clean, it is close to good Hotels and you don't need a car. The bus takes you everywhere. I have to say I have walked, ate right and was down 14 lbs before arriving here in Vegas and dropped another 25. I have a Players card from The Palms and The Rio Hotel. With the cards which are free I eat for far less and the food is great and healthy!
I sleep well in this Ext Stay. The front desk is wonderful! It is well manned, if there is anything needed in the room it is done immediately. They have a nice assortment of light foods for Breakfast and hot tea and coffee. The price for the room is unbeatable and the beds are more comfortable than on the Strip. If it wasn't a great deal with comfort I wouldn't have stayed the whole 13 week contract.
I rate this 10/10 so get a good deal for your flight, stay here and meet the nicest and most helpful staff in Vegas. They made my stay so nice and I really value how easy it was to get around. The best thing was I bought a cart at Food4less down the street and could bring my food right inside and you have a full size fridge, 4 burner stove top and microwave. They have cookware, all the things you need to function. I just bought a pan I preferred but that was my thing lol!
This place will make it possible for you to go to Vegas more than once a year. The Strip's prices are ridiculous!</p><br>Good trip<p>Staff is very helpful, rooms are clean and well stocked, location is convenient to strip without having to get into heavy traffic. It would also be convenient to the university. We had a very nice kitchen area that we did use. We stayed in the queen suite because we were in LV for nearly six weeks and really, really liked the setup. We will choose this facility again.</p><br></body></html>
