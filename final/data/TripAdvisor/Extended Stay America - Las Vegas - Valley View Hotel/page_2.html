<html><head><h3>Extended Stay America - Las Vegas - Valley View Hotel Reviews Page 2</h3></head><body><br>Short stay in Las Vegas<p>We booked this hotel through Hotwire and were pleasantly surprised with the price and value of the Hotel. Our room as clean and quiet. Used the pool/ spa. The breakfast was basic continental but was enough to get the day started. Convenient location to the strip and shopping if you have a car.</p><br>This one goes in the book.....<p>My family stayed here 2/13-2/17 for a volleyball tournament. Booked through booking.com. Don't be fooled by the pictures! The rooms don't look like that. When we checked in our room was missing a microwave & the sleeper soda. When we went back to the office to tell them we were told that they did us a courtesy of checking us in early. We insisted that we needed the sleeper sofa and the microwave so they said they'd move us into the next available room. The room we got moved to was missing the bathroom door!!! When we told them about it they looked surprised.....like they didn't know the friggin door was missing. I was shocked. We were ready to check out but management discounted our rate. So we decided to stay....albeit without a bathroom door. LOL. So this one goes in the book as the first place we've ever stayed that didn't have a bathroom door. Not in a good part of town either. Some of the screens on the windows are bent & looks like someone has broken into the rooms before. If you still want to book here you should also buy disinfectant wipes to wipe down the surfaces. Our bedroom door had a dirty sticky film on it.
Don't choose this for the free breakfast either because it's not worth it.
Room Tip: Don't stay here.

I own a programmable slow cooker and with a nice full sized refrigerator had nice meals in the room and where I could cook, pack and bring to work.
I really loved the location. On a day off I was very close to the Strip to go anytime and also I enjoyed movies at the Palms. The Rio was awesome to go to which is across the street.</p><br>Terrible house keeping.<p>If you just want to change clothes and not sleep or bathe this is the place to be. There is no housekeeping service during your stay or garbage cans in the rooms, so you can use your imagination to build a picture. There were no face towels our entire stay and when we asked management they said they just didn't have any. Those white face towels are a $1.00 from the dollar store. The room smelled so bad and when we complained they informed us it was nothing to do but spray air freshener. The room phone was so nasty like it never was cleaned before when we tried calling my sisters room. The price was different from their website which was disturbing. Overall bad hotel and the extended stay I have ever stayed in.</p><br>Dirty, old, bad area, no real breakfast.....<p>This hotel was pretty filthy - there was hair all over the bathroom floor, sink, and shower. Gross. Then there were hairs all in the bed as well, and some stains on the sheets. I am very happy we were only there for 1 night. The "free breakfast" advertised on Hotwire was an absolute joke, and very disappointing, since that was one of the main reasons that we booked this hotel. It literally consisted of coffee, granola bars and 2 bruised apples. The neighborhood was sketchy; a few blocks back from the strip in an alley like atmosphere. The check-in guy was very polite. I know we could have stayed at better hotels for the $50 per night (on a Thursday, not weekend), at much better quality, and actual amenities listed. I would not recommend this place or ever stay there again.
Room Tip: Just don't do it!
See more room tips</p><br>dirty, hot, old<p>don't waste your time or money ... hot dirty and old ... dirty towels left in bathroom from last guest , dirty showers , filthy floors ,.. super uncomfortable bed and the Ac didn't work ... it was 100 degrees outside and no air at night is unbearable !</p><br>Once inside, you wouldn't know you were getting the cheapest rates in vegas.<p>The location was out of the way (you get what you pay for) but we still were able to walk to all our destinations. I had no idea it was going to have a kitchen and a separate living room, so they kinda undersell themselves. Super comfy bed, quiet spot. I'd stay again.</p><br>Maybe my room was an exception<p>This hotel has received TripAdvisor awards, which is why I chose it. Because I gave the hotel a poor rating you're obviously going to read an unflattering review, so first some disclaimers on what I like and don't like, which might give some context/perspective to my opinions that follow. I don't mind "old" at all; peeling paint/wallpaper does not bother me. Cracked concrete walkways (so long as they're not unsafe) do not bother me. What I do mind is the feeling that the proprietors have given up and just don't care anymore. It's the latter that I feel applies to this place.

Some specifics: no shampoo in the room or otherwise available, no clothes hangers in the room or otherwise available, towels had holes and were grungy, the housekeeping carts looked like they'd been vomited on, only a thin sheet over the mattress (no mattress pad --ewww!), my feet got dirty from walking on the bathroom floor so I cleaned the floor myself, the toilet was a shorty (bowl diameter) but had an elongated toilet seat, crumbs on the counter, frost in freezer and refrigerator, springy mattress, black moldy-looking grout in the shower, water puddling in refrigerator, and lots of burns and gouges in the counters.

As my title says, maybe I got the worst room in the place and picked the only day of the year where they ran out of everything I needed.

It's not the worst hotel I've ever stayed at, but compared to the Best Westerns, Hampton Inns, and La Quintas that I've stayed at, it's sure near the bottom of my list. It's worth noting they did give me a 1-night-stay comp coupon in an attempt to make me happy.</p><br>Good stay !<p>I thought it was rather nice stay at this hotel, I started my trip(I'm a poker player) at Bally's hotel where I thought it was quite overpriced for the same or less service(You have to pay 15$/day to access internet at Bally's + they charge you amenity fees on the bill just to have the access to internet, kind of a scam if you think about it), never found the fitness room there(at Bally's) and you had to cross the all casino to have access to the pool...

At extended stay not only you are off the strip(means less noise and more quiet nights) but the room was quite nice with kitchen facilities, free(basic) breakfast to go, and the pool right next to the fitness room, easy to access. Internet is free which is nice ! My room didn't get serviced the first 3 nights which was not a bother for me as I dont spend a lot of time in my room and don't need my sheets change or towels replaced that often.

Overall a great stay, the staff was quite accomodating and smiling, they extended my stay upon request without fuss, you're a 5 min walk form the Rio(which is essential when you play at the WSOP) and 20 min walk from the strip if you don't mind walking through traffic and stuff... I recommend if for anyone who is sick of the crowdy strip and the overpriced rooms. I will definetely stay again there maybe for longer and skip the strip madness.</p><br>Acceptable for long-term stay<p>It's my first time in an Extended Stay America hotel, and I like the idea of having a kitchen inside the room especially for long trips. The room was clean and cozy, and the full-sized refrigerator alone made the price worth it for me.

The location of this particular hotel is kind of in the middle of nowhere, although within a short driving distance to the strip. So you could view this as both a pro and a con. It was convenient for me though since it was just a 5-minute drive to my place of work since I was traveling on business.

Overall, very good experience and great value. My room was upgraded for free when I requested for one near the parking since I had a lot of luggage. The Grab and Go breakfast was a nice touch too, although they did run out of coffee one day and took some time to refill.
Room Tip: If you have a car and have luggage, best to get a ground floor room right in front of parking.
