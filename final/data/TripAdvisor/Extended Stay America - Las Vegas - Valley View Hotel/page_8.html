<html><head><h3>Extended Stay America - Las Vegas - Valley View Hotel Reviews Page 8</h3></head><body><br>Staff Great needs furniture and Bedding upgrade<p>I would like to say all of the staff are GREAT and helpful its just to bad the property isn't better maintained.They have put down new floors and painted however the house keeping staff needs to do a deep cleaning there is grime on the outside of the tubs hair in the tubs the faucets in the shower are tarnished and hard watered stain good old vinegar and a Mr clean earaser would work wonders.The furniture needs to be upgraded bad... the beds are old and hard the pillows are awful I opened up my pillow case and they were stained. Grime on the front of the tv stands/dressers and I went and bought my own dish soap to re wash dishes just because I wasn't sure.. Didn't see any cleaning supplies on maids cart.It also needs new drapes and bedding and light fixtures it would brighten the place up 100%.I think all this place needs is a lot of TLC.Used the laundry room it to needs to be cleaned.Unless they do major cleaning and upgrading I will never stay here again.</p><br>Awesome Staff!!!!!!<p>I pulled into this property tired and hurting all over,My husband Has cancer and we are here house hunting.
Linda (manager) and her front desk staff where so helpful...I can't rave about them enough.
They quickly saw how wiped out I was unloaded my car for me and brought everything to my room.
Tears were in my eyes....they really cared about what I am going thru,to top it all off the wouldn't take a tip!!!
From the front desk to the Handy man they are all Fantastic!!!
Key one of the housekeeper's on her day off came and took care of my husband while i went to look at house's She is way beyond AWESOME!!!!!
Roger and Elex (sorry E not sure of spelling)are such gentlemen.
If I owned this property I would give Linda the funding to upgrade everything in the hotel itself ...you have the most wonderful staff but the place really needs an upgrade badly.
Staff here can only do so much... there not miracle workers ...but I have to say the come really close.
Thank you for making my stay here as pleasant as possible under the circumstances.
Adrienne</p><br>Staying at Extended Stay Hotel<p>I am a resident of four months, the staff from the General Manager to the desk clerks and housekeeping are courtious and very helpfull. I became sick and had to be taken to the hospitol with very serious problems, since i have been back they check on me and if i need anything at all they are always there to help. What more could you say!!! Rooms are clean and there property imaculate, there are clean laundry facilities, a heated pool and jacuzzi, fresh towels whenever needed at front desk. I have never seen or heard of any problems with any riff-raff. So for one night or six months you couldn't ask for a better place to stay. Thanks everyone, Jeff K.</p><br>great service<p>Nice place to stay with excellent value for what you pay. You are right by the strip and literally across the street from the Palms and Rio. What stands out though is the staff, they actually go the extra mile. One example, the GM - Linda - was able to accommodate me last minute when I need to extend my stay. I expected push back but instead I received great service. I highly recommend this hotel.</p><br>Perfect home away from home<p>Some things I really like were things such as Linda and her great staff. They are the most helpful and considerate that I have experienced in years. Every single one of them have a great smile and great attitude to go with that smile, even when dealing with unpleasant customers who think they are staying at the Hilton. Next is the room size. All of these are two-room suites! That means they are virtually a mini-apartment with a small, but full, bathroom and they same with n they kitchen.If you need a reasonably priced extended stay facility for business or whatever, this is the best deal in town. If you or your company plan on needing housing for at least three months be sure to ask about the LTL (Long-term lease) plan, it will save you a fortune.</p><br>Great!<p>The staff here was great! They were very helpful and accommodating. Roger checked me in and made everything easy with his great attitude. Thanks!</p><br>home away from home<p>ive been a guest at extended stay for over 3 years and i must say that the staff here has been very helpful to me. im an elderly man whos needed a little bit of help from time to time and i couldnt be more grateful to be surrounded by such a helpful staff.</p><br>I'll Be Back !<p>Very pleasant staff..... Linda made sure I was comfortable and Roger has the most amazing smile this side of the Mississippi. They both made sure my check in was swift but rendered the care and courtesy expected drinks the hospitality industry. This was my first stay in one of your facilities but you can be sure it won't be my last...... Thanks to the amazing care of Roger & Linda</p><br>Great time in Vegas.<p>We came to Vegas for the NCAA basketball tournament and had a great time. The beds were nice and comfortable and the location was great.</p><br>Friendly service convenient location<p>Manager Linda and rest of the staff, from receptionists to maintenace, are amazingly friendly and helpful..Being staying here for last 10 years off and on...Few minutes from las vegas strip...I highly recommend it...</p><br></body></html>
