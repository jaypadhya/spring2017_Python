<html><head><h3>Comfort Inn & Suites Las Vegas Hotel Reviews Page 1</h3></head><body><br>Good For a Night's Stay<p>This hotel was great for the night as we were passing through. Would probably not choose to stay for an extended amount of time. Not much around the hotel. The rooms were average, and the wifi worked just fine.</p><br>dont believe the no pets policy<p>Very disappointed that the front desk allowed a women with a small dog to rent a room after listening to her whine fir 5 minutes. We picked this hotel because they said NO PETS. Room itself was clean and staff was courteous. Breakfast was below average for comfort inns. Only apples left for fruit at 830.</p><br>Perfect for Fort Nellis <p>If you're going to Ft. Nellis, this is the perfect place to stay. You will arrive at the front gate in less than a couple of minutes. I did have a few issues with some of the face towels looking a little dingy! I asked that they be replaced, but nobody came to replace them. Otherwise, this is more than...
More </p><br>Business Trip Stopover<p>Very clean and well maintained hotel. Bed was comfortable, allowing for a good night's rest. Breakfast was hot and staff was excellent at keeping up with the demand. Coffee urns were quickly replaced as they emptied. For a passing one night stay, this was a pleasant experience.</p><br>Stayed here for EDC June 19-22<p>We rented a king suite so we could get the shuttle to EDC... The room was adequate and suited our needs. The price was very high at $229 but the whole point was the shuttle and man did that pay off. They have THEEE BEST shuttle driver in all of Las Vegas! She kept driving onto the shoulder even though...
More </p><br>How do you spell "dive"<p>Wow...can't believe this is a Comfort Inn nor the rate I paid to stay here. The hotel is very very old and worn out. The room smells of dirty feet and tthe phone doesn't work. Taking off your shoes feels like a risk. I stopped by the pool but not sure if the pump is working as I saw hair...
More </p><br>Helpful staff, reasonably priced stay away from the The Strip<p>Stopped by this hotel as a last-minute - rang the front desk at 10pm to advise we'd probably arrive closer to 1am. Person taking the booking was patient and helpful enough, it was a reasonably priced room away from The Strip. Ample parking. We needed to use the laundry facilities so that was convenient. The complimentary breakfast in the morning...
More </p><br>Short stay<p>Nice room. Only a short drive from the strip. An excellent place to stay if you want to visit Vegas but not stay on the strip. Breakfast was hot and fresh and staff was friendly. Would recommend to anyone wanting to visit Vegas on a budget. Five stars!!!!</p><br>Comfortable hotel off the strip<p>Stopped at this hotel on our way back from Zion Nat'l Park. The room rate at this hotel in North Las Vegas was lower than the Strip for a Friday, so it was an incentive to stay. When we checked in during the afternoon, the hotel was empty and quiet, a contrast from the casino hotels. Hotel appears to be...
More </p><br>The most comfortable bed I've slept in on the road in quite awhile<p>I stayed at this hotel twice in April: once on the way to Joshua Tree National Park and once returning. Both times, the service at the front desk was friendly and quite efficient; and the breakfast room staff were friendly and helpful. The rooms were spotless and, as I said above, the beds (and pillows) were incredibly comfortable. In addition,...
