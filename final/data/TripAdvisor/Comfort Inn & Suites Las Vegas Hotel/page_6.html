Getting off the freeway to get here at night was a bit tricky but definitely will stay here again.</p><br>Quality and professional service<p>This was our second stay with this group of hotels. We found the first stay to be so pleasant we made a decision to book in Las Vegas area. It was a clean quiet hotel. We found the staff to be very professional helpful and friendly, thanks Yared.They made our visit a pleasent experience. We have now made a decision to switch to this group for all our hotel needs.</p><br>real value for money<p>this place is a little dated and could use a face lift, but its quiet and clean, has everything you need for a value for money stay. decent sized room, kitchenette, bath/shower, tv. the free breakfast buffet is really good, fresh and has all the choices you need for a great start to the day. the location is not central and a few blocks off the strip but you can get where you need to go by bus which is pretty frequent. i would stay here again on another value for money trip.</p><br>Stayed three days, very enjoyable, superb staff<p>I had a business/pleasure trip for the Nellis AFB area, so I booked all three nights here. It was a very good stay. Room was immaculate, bed was super comfortable, staff was very friendly (I had two separate rooms as a King wasn't available for the third night, but on check-in, they saw that one was and switched my last night's reservation to the same king room, which I appreciated). Enjoyed the breakfasts, and fitness center especially. Location is very convenient to both I-15 and Las Vegas Blvd. The only negatives were a little light shower pressure on the third floor and the pillow softness could have been a little better. Convenient to food, fuel, shopping, etc. Walmart being just a few hundred feet away was good, as I got a flat tire on LV Blvd and took it to Walmart for repair as per rental car company request.</p><br>Clean, Good Breakfast!<p>Very happy to say this was a good stay! The property looks fairly new, but the staff was very courteous, even remembered I had requested a bed and sent it with me! The Lobby was very nice and open and the breakfast was pretty good! I thought the rooms were very clean and well stocked with toiletries and towels. We got two rooms, adjoining for me, my husband, 3 kids, grandma and grandpa, for an overnight stay. I would stay here again! Our room included a microwave and fridge! Perfect for a stay with kiddos!</p><br>Nice stay<p>Nice stay away from all the hustle and bustle of the strip. Hotel is very clean and has a very friendly staff. Has some good restaurants nearby. It's located near an industrial park so there's not much to look at, but we had nice quiet stay.</p><br>Near industrial park<p>My family and I stayed there on July 3, and found the place very quiet, mostly I think because there were no business people around for the holiday. Having driven there from the Grand Canyon, it was nice to have a good place outside of the Las Vegas hustle and bustle. After a good night's sleep there, we were ready to drive to the strip for a fun-filled day. So glad after several of hours of driving that I wasn't trying to find my way to a hotel on the strip that night. The staff was very hospitable.</p><br>Extremely helpful and kind service<p>We really loved the friendliness of the staff. The room was clean and comfortable with a refrigerator. The breakfast was very satisfactory. They even gave us a ticket for a free car wash next door. You must visit Valley of Fire State Park northeast of the city.
Room Tip: Get a room on the first floor

I would stay here again.</p><br>Clean, quiet off strip hotel<p>I had to be in Las Vegas on business in April 2012. I chose this hotel based on the reviews here on Trip Advisor. I was not disappointed in any way, shape or form. I arrived early just to see if I could find the hotel as I was between meetings and asked what time check in was. To my surprise, the front desk clerk said I could check in on the spot. I was given a room on the 3rd floor and I'm not sure there was anyone else on the floor. Rooms were great, the beds comfortable and the internet worked great. I will now be staying at this hotel every time I'm in Las Vegas for work.
Room Tip: The hotel is 10-15 minutes from the strip depending on traffic and where you are going.
