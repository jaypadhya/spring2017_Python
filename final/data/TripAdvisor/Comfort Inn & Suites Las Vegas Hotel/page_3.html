<html><head><h3>Comfort Inn & Suites Las Vegas Hotel Reviews Page 3</h3></head><body><br>One of the worst nights in a hotel ever.<p>We were getting an early start on our trip to Canada by traveling in the evening from San Diego. We missed the LA and Las Vegas traffic and checked in late (1 am). We get to our room and it has NO air conditioning (it is Las Vegas!) We called the front desk - they said put your card in the slot on the wall and turn the thermostat. We tried numerous times and being after 1 with our 2 daughters we did not call the front desk back. We were so exhausted - we thought we would tough it out - IT WAS AWFUL! There was also a connecting door to the next room - we had to stuff a towel underneath because you could see shoes in the next room! There was no vent or fan in the bathroom! The room was already soooo hot. The next morning we stepped out into the hall and "cool Air". We were also on the 3rd floor and in the morning we realized you could open the window - NO SCREEN! How dangerous is that. The breakfast was the only positive thing we ran into at this hotel - it was nice. We talked to the front desk upon checking out and their response was "we have people to call 24 hours a day". We replied, the room should have been checked out before we checked in. Never again!
Room Tip: Make sure the air conditioning works - it is LAS VEGAS!

Had a few problems when checking in. First when the desk clerk assigned us our room, we went up to it, opened the door only to find a room in complete chaos. The beds weren't made up, in fact the bedding looked new and still in wrappers laying on the beds and tables. We went down and told her and she reassigned us another room. I had noticed the sign at the front desk about their energy efficient key system where you have to have your room key to turn on the lights and air conditioning. So while my husband was getting our luggage, i went up to the room and put the key in the slot. The lights came on but not the ac. I tried everything the note said to do~ it would not work! Went back down and told her~ she was a little rude telling me about the energy option, finally said ok I will go show you how to do it. When she came up, she was surprised to find that I was right, and after a little investigation, discovered that someone had turned a hidden switch off on the wall next to the unit. The ac worked fine after it was turned on. She was also not helpful when we asked how to get to the airport from the hotel, just told us it was about 30 minutes away, not how to get there.
Overall, the hotel and the other staff were good. Our second room was very nice, clean and comfortable. Large bathroom. The breakfast was good also. We just had problems with
this one desk clerk. We stayed in this same hotel on our way back home from California and no problems what so ever. Thankfully we had a different clerk!</p><br>Good choice on North side<p>Modern well run hotel. Up to date furnishings in good repair, great breakfast, washing machines, good service staff. Fairly good price for Las Vegas. Fairly close to Nevins Air Force base and Speedway.</p><br>Close to Motor Speedway<p>After a 13 hour drive from Grants pass, this hotel was exactly what we needed for a good nights sleep. We also choose this hotel because of how close it was to the Las Vegas Motor Speedway, as we attended the Ford Mustang 50 Years of Celebrations. The front desk lady was very nice and sign in was quick, our room was on the frist floor which was nice. Room itself was great, standard hotel room, clean and comfy beds. The continetal breakfast looked good, I didnt eat anything as I wanted to finish up my yogurt/nuts, but my husband enjoyed the range of goodies. Wish we had more time to enjoy the sites of Vegas/maybe next time. I would recommend this hotel for sure.</p><br>Great rooms!<p>My family and I stayed here due to how close it was to the Las Vegas Motor Speedway. The rate was reasonable. Our rooms were wonderful, clean, very comfortable beds. Also there was a refrigerator, microwave, coffee in the room as well. They also have a great continental breakfast with many hot and cold options. Service however was a little poor and they had messed up our original reservation. They however were able to resolve this during our stay. We would definitely stay again and recommend others. Great rooms!</p><br>totally fine!<p>This place is totally fine! NOT fancy and NOT on the strip (at LEAST 15 minutes, if not 20, by car) but clean, staff is nice, it is mellow and the beds and showers are good. The breakfast is JUST ok. For someone like me that doesn't like bready sweet fatty stuff in the morning I wish there were more healthy options like fruit, but the eggs and sausage were good and I think it is a pretty traditional hotel breakfast.
Room Tip: they are all about the same
See more room tips</p><br>nice staff, ok room<p>Great location off the strip , great, friendly, and helpfull staff..the room was average and some stained towels but i got a good deal and didnt complain. good access to the hwy.. the breakfast was alright...Id go again but probably not going to be my first option.</p><br>Excellent trip<p>Very friendly and helpful staff, food was excellent, rooms cleans, great location - had a wonderful stay!! Easy access to the speedway, safe area, easy to find, great to be able to use the computer to print out boarding passes - Thanks</p><br>Nice Hotel<p>We where looking for a good value in Las Vegas for one night over New Years as we were just passing through on a quick trip. This property was just what we needed. It was away from the lights and noise of the strip and also the high prices that goes along with a holiday. The desk clerk at check in was awesome! She was very efficient and friendly. The room was as expected and the parking was excellent as we were pulling a trailer. It was exactly as advertised with no unpleasant surprises. We would stay here again in the future.</p><br>Good valve, off strip location<p>We wanted a hotel off the strip and this was a good choice for this. Convenient location to highway, gas, party store etc. The room was larger than expected and was clean and comfortable with a king sized bed, chair, desk and closet. The breakfast was good and the staff was very friendly and helpful. The only complaints about this hotel are that there is this weird heating/cooling system that you have to have a room key inserted by the door to operate. Hopefully the unit is turned on in your room because if it's not, the digital wall panel will not work; which is what we found out when we asked about it the next morning. If traveling with children, I would be cautious of the 2nd floor windows, which do fully open and do not have screens in them to prevent falls. Other then that this hotel is a good valve for the money and is very clean and comfortable.</p><br></body></html>
