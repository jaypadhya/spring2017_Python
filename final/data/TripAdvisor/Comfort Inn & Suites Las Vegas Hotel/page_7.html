<html><head><h3>Comfort Inn & Suites Las Vegas Hotel Reviews Page 7</h3></head><body><br>Nice - Off Strip<p>We were headed out of town to the Grand Canyon and didn't want to deal with the chaos of the Strip. The hotel itself was nice; a good breakfast and clean rooms. The neighborhood wasn't the best in that there really wasn't anything to walk to. Also, we didn't swim, but looking at the pool, it seemed that maybe the drain needed some work. Overall, I would have no problems staying here again.</p><br>A Great Place to Stay<p>We were very please with the quality of the room and the friendly staff. They offered free bottles of water to all guest, the conntential breakfast was better than most, the rooms were clean, quiet and very comfortable. We were riding a motorcyle and they asked us to park it in the entrance way so the staff and camera would watch it all night and keep it secure. The price was very reasonable. There are no nearby resturants other than a Subway down the street and an Italian Pizza place across the street that makes the best pizza.</p><br>Nice place to stay off the Strip<p>We stayed here one night on our way from Utah to California. Young lady who checked us in was pleasant enough. Our room was on the ground floor and was spacious, clean and quiet other than the AC ran constantly. We were able to regulate the temperature to make it comfortable and the AC wasn't overly loud. We had a microwave and refrigerator. The bed was comfortable enough. TV was modern and had decent channel selection. The morning breakfast was adequate. The staff were attentive and kept the breakfast items stocked and the area clean. The hotel is located fairly conveniently off I-70 and not far from the raceway and AFB. Noticed some fastfood places and a Walmart near by. Seems to be in somewhat of an industrial area. Will consider staying again when next in the area.</p><br>AC problem<p>Very noisy AC located right by bed seemed to have only one setting, too cold.
Room Tip: If I were to stay here again I'd be sure to ask for a room with a better ac setup. I was here o...

He gave us milk and yogurt for my 2 year old so she would be comfortable and happy before going to sleep. He was very nice and friendly but I don't remember his name. The room was good size and very clean. The TV was older but everything was clean. I didn't hear a lot of noise from other rooms and we got a good night sleep. They offer a free buffet breakfast in the morning and I thought it was very good. Eggs were great and sausage was good. they had many fresh pastries and cereal and fresh juice. The staff was helpful in finding what we needed and answering any questions. I would definitely stay here again on a quick overnight stay.</p><br>Perfectly adequate<p>This is a big hotel with lots of rooms and quite spread out. We were on a second floor and there was no help with the luggage and no elevator. Room was fine. Price was great considering how close it is to the Strip. Thankfully much quieter. Places to eat within walking distance, breakfast buffet provided. Typical motel breakfast. Perfectly adequate all around.</p><br>Nice place to stay, If you don’t want the Vegas Casinos Near by<p>My family and I stayed at this hotel in late March 2012. I have stayed at a few other Comfort Inn & Suites in the past. This trip did not disappoint. The room we stayed in had 2 very comfortable beds. A flat screen TV with Cable. The kids were able to find something to watch why the wife and I relaxed after a long drive. The property has a nice small pool (heated) and a hot tub that is nice for soaking in and relaxing. When we arrived we were greeted by the counter staff, and check in was a breeze. The neighborhood the Hotel is located in is a bit industrial / commercial. This makes it nice because there are a few C stores around and a few places to grab a bit to eat. I wouldn’t recommend walking around this area after dark, but I didn’t feel like my car was going to get vandalized either. Keep in mind that this hotel is a good 20 to 30 min away from any of the Major Vegas Attractions. So if you are planning on spending time on the strip, and don’t mind the drive take a look at this place. Otherwise look for something closer to downtown. What I did not like about this stay was the Breakfast in the morning. The selection of food was average, Eggs, Sausage, Cereal, and the standard waffle maker that seems to be in most of the hotels now days. The problem was the staff was not able to keep the items stocked. They would bring out 10 of an item (for a crowd of maybe 20 guests) then take a 10 min break before the next item was brought out. This ensured that everything was out and you were waiting up to 20 min for a replacement food item to be brought out. We played this game for about 30 min before we settled on a bowl of cereal and made plans to eat a better breakfast elsewhere. To sum it up. Great place to stay as long as you’re not planning on using the breakfast in the morning.
Room Tip: The breakfast is nice, but they have trouble keeping it stocked. Plan on eating else where.
See more room tips</p><br>Great Stay<p>Very clean, big room and comfortable bed/pillows--great room. Microwave and refrigerate in our business suite. The lobby is well appointed. The motel is very much away from the strip so much more quiet. We asked for a top floor room away from the street so slept like babies. It has a convenience store next to it and a few restaurants close too. (I think there is a Wal-Mart down the street.) There is a guest laundry with soap & softner you can buy (I brought my own Purex 3-in-1) We will be staying here 2 nights and so far I have no negatives.

All the staff have been wonderful but a special thank you to Rea for being so friendly to tired customers! Free bottled water at the front desk. Very much worth the $88 (w/ tax) that we paid. I understand they won a "Gold Award" and I see why.

(AND thank you to all the Trip Advisors who write reviews on motels as this is always the FIRST place I check before I book a motel.)
Room Tip: You might be able to get a free upgrade if they aren't busy and you just ask.

Not because of the hotel itself, but because we're so cheap. This room cost a bit more than we wanted to pay, but it was certainly worth it. It was neat, clean, and spacious. Perfect to relax in. I'd definitely recommend it (if you can spare the money).</p><br>nice hotel, away from the hustle but busy area still<p>Hotel was very nice, clean and very friendly & helpful staff. Would stay here again if wanting to just pass thru Vegas, but would ask for room away from the busy front street (Craig).</p><br></body></html>
