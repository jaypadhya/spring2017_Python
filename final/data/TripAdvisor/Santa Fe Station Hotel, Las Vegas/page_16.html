<html><head><h3>Santa Fe Station Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 16</h3></head><body><br>Beware Non-Smokers !!--Good casino and dining choices though<p>The Santa Fe Station is an older hotel which is part of the "Station Casinos", a brand frequented by the local Las Vegas market. I booked a non-smoking room and was put in a room on the 2nd floor, which smelled like fresh cigarette smoke. After several hours of not being able to sleep, I asked the front desk to move rooms at 7:30 a.m. The front desk, told me that the 2nd floor is a mixed smoking and non-smoking! I was moved to the 3rd floor towards the rear of the hotel and didn't have smoke issues in this room. The hotel resort fee is outrageous and ended up being a 50% tax on the PL room rate. The wireless internet didn't work in either room, and I paid for it as part of the resort fee.

Now for some positives. I have gambled and eaten at Santa Fe Station over the years (just not stayed there). For the gambler looking for low table limits and looser slots this is the place to be. They also have a large selection of low denomination video poker machines. For dining the "Feast Buffet" cannot be beat and the price is a bargain compared to the Strip Buffets (even dinner is usually below $12 a person, but make sure you sign up for the "Boarding Pass" slot club to get a discount on your buffet. I believe the cafe is now back to being run by the hotel, so from past experience you will be get good value for your money. Also the fast food court will give the person looking for a fast meal many choices.

I have stayed at numerous Station Casinos,but this was my first time at Santa Fe Station Hotel . The Aliante Station and Texas Station hotels, both in North Las Vegas are much better choices for hotels. Unfortunately as a long time Station Casino patron, the Santa Fe Station hotel was a major disappointment and left a sour taste in my mouth. Try to avoid this hotel.</p><br>A pleasant alternative to the Strip<p>The room was clean and quiet. There were lots of video poker machines in the casino. The food choices were good and we couldn't believe the level of service we found.</p><br>No hassle comfort<p>Santa Fe may seem off the beaten path for most. but I play the local casinos... this puts Santa Fe in a great location. Once you check in there's lots to do though I enjoy the wide selection of Video Poker and slots. The food selections vary and all have been enjoyable and affordable. The room is clean and comfortable. Staying alone was never a concern. I always felt safe. There is one drawback...the bathroom is small, even tiny...but it lends itself with the possibility of many funny stories and encounters to share with family and friend upon your return.

We always stay at least one night at a Hotel/Casino and this year we picked the Santa Fe Station Casino. It was by far the best experience we've had in all the years we've done this together. I would genuinely recommend The Station Casinos as the way to go if you just need some of that "kickin' back time" like we do each year:)
Room Tip: We were not picky about the room location.

We would certainly stay there again and recommend to all.</p><br>Excellent hotel for families<p>Hotel is great for families; bowling, movies, game room and food court on site in addition to many restaurants and buffet.

Although hotel is off the strip, you are not stuck in "tourist traffic". But the hotel is just minutes off the freeway to get to the strip or downtown. I have been coming to Vegas for 30 years so I know the city streets as well as my own home town.

I would rather they allowed kids in fitness room if accompanied by their parent rather than not at all.</p><br>The friendliest, cleanest, best value hotel off the strip.<p>The people who work at the Santa Fe Station are some of the friendliest in Las Vegas. For a hotel with good prices, you would not expect the excellent service and clean rooms that you will find here. At the Santa Fe, you are not running into other people all the time. You can enjoy the Vegas vibe without the crowds. I know many people like to stay on the strip, but not me. I prefer this location better, but you can still get to the strip easily (it's right off the freeway) , if you need to. And you have a variety of great eating places to choose from right here.</p><br>Mrs.<p>All of the staff we came in contact with was very, very friendly and helpful. Many of them called us by our names. i had some special needs and they were ever so helpful in making sure we had everything to make our stay most pleasant and comfortable.

I love this hotel and casino. They have a huge variety of machines to play and the buffet always shines. There again, fabulous staff. They all go out of their way to be friendly and to ask if there might be something they could assist us with.

There are a few things that I especially enjoy like the newspaper everyday morning, tfree WiFihe and a free Starbuck's coffee.. What a nice touch. This hotel has it all and it's very, very comfortable.

It's so nice to be able to get something to eat if you're hungry late at night. They have a very nice food court where there are a number of nice offerings, One thing that really stood out for us was a NO SMOKING area. That's was just great.

I just can't think of enough good things to say about this hotel and casino. The slot hostess tends to every detail and is beyond helpful. She is just fabulous and makes you feel like you're her best friend.

We have been staying at the Santa Fe every time we come to LV for the past 3 or 4 years and we stay 7-8 days each time. It's so nice to be away from the Strip and all heavy crowds and porno material that's handed out as you walk down the strip. This is very conveniently right off the expressway, scads of free, very well lit parking or if you wish they also have Valets. They offer everything a Strip hotel would offer except the crowds.and the high prices.

Give it a try.The Santa Fe is IT!!!</p><br>Nice place to stay<p>Clean, good service, friendly employees nice place to stay if your not inyo all the goopla of the strip.</p><br>Great Experience!<p>I would recommend this hotel when your in Vegas. While it is not close to the Strip, it was in a convienient location, with excellent access to the freeway. I knew about all the "hidden charges/resort fees UP FRONT when I booked my stay. The room was clean and the employees professional. I would stay there on my next trip to Vegas.</p><br></body></html>
