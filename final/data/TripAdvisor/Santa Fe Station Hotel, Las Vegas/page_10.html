<html><head><h3>Santa Fe Station Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 10</h3></head><body><br>Breathless in Las Vegas<p>Allow me to preface this review my stating that I reside in a smoke-free city. The casino decor is a cross between rustic casita and art deco. Only the lobby areas and area outside cafe and buffet restaurants were vaulted, the remainder of the hotel is treyed ceilings which allows for the collection of smike pockets throughout. The conference space is quite grand and not to be missed. The conference space was also reasonably smoke free, mostly likely due to the vaulted ceilings. Check-in was quick and effortless. The room was reasonably equipped, but poorly lit. Contrastly, the bathroom vanity was well lit. The room is a little smoky with the air conditioner running. Turning the air conditioner off lessens the smoke. I agree that there are stains on bedskirts but cannot speak to the cleanliness of the sheets as I slept on top of the covers.The hotel charges a daily resort fee for the newspaper and internet access as do a majority of hotels in Las Vegas. The hotel offers a bowling alley and movie theatre but I did not visit theses areas. A small coupon book is issued upon check-in which is quite valuable.
Room Tip: Avoid the second floor because it over looks the roof which has bright lights that shine upward towa...

The pool was smaller than most places we've been...but the kids didn't complain. Loved using the little coupons/discounts they give you when they hand you your room key. You get a discount of course if you eat at any of there restaurants. And this is actually one casino where the waitress actually came around often enough that you didn't have to wait an hour in between one drink. I would stay here again.</p><br>nice stay<p>I wasn't sure what to expect after reading reviews before we went. this was part of a block of rooms for a wedding. I read people who complained about having to haul your luggage across the casino to get to the elevator to get to rooms. that is so untrue. you go through a small section of the casino. so it was no big deal. yes you could smell the smoke. but what do you expect it's a casino........ very quite hotel. parking garage and valet. the only complaint I have is you have to go outside onto the street to get to the pool. and part of the casino. unless there was another way in and we couldn't find it. good stay anyway</p><br>You Get What You Pay For<p>We have been to Vegas countless times but rarely stay off the strip unless the resort is high-end. Our child had an event on this end of town and the price @ $39/night was too good to pass up.

The positives: It's really not a bad place. The rooms are reasonably comfortable. The buffet is a bargain! $5 for breakfast and $10 for dinner, and every bit as good as most buffets on the strip. They have a movie theatre and bowling alley that the kids loved.

The negatives: the air quality is so poor that one of our party suffered an asthma attack just walking through the casino. The maintenance is lacking. Our toilet leaked but, never fear, I fixed it myself. The ice machine was broken. The walls must be paper thin because you can hear everything.

Bottom line... I would not stay here again, though I might come back for the buffet!</p><br>Not bad for the price but not close to the strip<p>My husband and son stayed here for the National Trap shooting championships. It was a basic hotel; far from strip but the rooms were clean and the price was right. There were restaurants, bowling alley and of course, a casino. It served its purpose.</p><br>Alternative Stay<p>Stayed here due to the fact it was near where my grandchildren were staying. Overall was a good choice. Buffet and caf√© was good. It has a theater, a bowling alley and best of all a Starbucks. Could use some updating and the carpet really needed cleaning in the room. The staff everywhere was fantastic and very helpful. I gamble so was in casino every night. Dealers and Pit basses very friendly and professional. Drink service at tables was very slow, heard that from others and saw it each night.</p><br>I only came here because a conference paid<p>Barely tolerable. Half hour out of the city. Found a roach when dining in the buffet...which was edible. The servers in the Diner were really nice.

Twice while we stayed here the fire alarm went off. Once at 4am and the other at 11pm. Both times we were told it was a "malfunction".


Rooms were clean but no cups in the room at all. was told I'd have wifi, but the could never worked.</p><br>Enjoyed it but Barely Rating Average<p>We were in the area and stayed for only one night. The room was a pretty good size and mostly clean. However, there were a few maintainence issues that were obvious and apparent that should have been fixed or repaired long ago.

Immediately upon entering we noticed red stains on the carpet between the two beds. Looks like beverage spills from previous guests. The bed skirt on one of the beds was ripped and looked damaged for awhile. The wall paper on the window sill was peeling. The corners where the carpet meets the wall had dust built up so thick you can see the change in colors. "VIP" was scratched on the bathroom door and needs be repainted. Grout near the shower needs to be fixed. Although the room was larger, the bathroom was very small. You'll have to close the door before sitting down on the toilet. The room is probably about $30 if that.

Other than the mentioned issues, we did enjoy our stay. The bedding, linens and towels looked and felt clean. There was plenty to do on property. There's a movie threatre, bowling alley, plenty of slots and table games, bars and various restaurants, fitness center, food court and a swimming pool. It was a strange walk from the room to the pool. The pool was small but clean. The pool furniture looked weathered and needs to be replaced, they were browned by the extreme heat. Before our stay we were not able to find any pool photos so we included some.

BE CAREFUL near the edge of the pool as the design is smooth and very slippery. I actually slipped in trying to enter the pool, luckily was not hurt but could have been bad. The hotel will charge you an additional $14.55 for amenities per stay as previous posters had mentioned.

One more thing, expect to be doing some second hand smoking until the property designates a smoking section in the casino. Our room was not as bad but you can smell the smoke in some parts of the hallways especially near the elevators.</p><br>very average<p>I stayed in this hotel 3 days because it was close to the home of my friends I was visiting. It is not a bad place to stay, I just did not find anything that would convince me to come back. Couple small issues that to some people may not matter. As a non-smoker I had to walk through areas filled with cigarette smoke. Lack of any mini-bar to keep drinks cold, probably by design. On Saturday night, some laud music around 3 in the morning (back of the hotel), maybe it is just my luck or local custom, I have no idea. I also did not like blocked sliding windows that allow you to open just couple inches but may be that is lesser evil of some sork. Cannot say much about gambling facilities because I do not gamble. I used normal parking (not a valet service), a lot of walking if you do that, plus also substantial walk inside to reach room (the place is big), very helpful room service and reception staff. I will pick a small motel in the area next time, may be this is just a mismatch between what that place is and what I needed.
Room Tip: nothing comes to mind
See more room tips</p><br>Not bad, not great<p>I stayed at the Santa Fe station for 2 nights for a work related event. Overall, the property has enough amenities to keep you entertained. I found the food to be very good, especially at the Mexican restaurant and prices were average for a bar/casino. This place is far from down town so expect a $50 cab ride to the strip. The hotel caters to locals so this is not a good choice for the touristy type. The room was clean, no problems. My only complaint and it is a big one, is that the entire hotel is a tremendous ashtray. I do not mind cigarette smoke but in this quantity it is impossible to breathe. My eyes were red and tearing and staying in a non-smoking room does not help at all. I chose to sit outside one night for a few hours just to get out there. Perhaps it is the ventilation system that is sub-par but I do not recommend anyone stay here that has allergies or any problems with cigarette smoke.</p><br></body></html>
