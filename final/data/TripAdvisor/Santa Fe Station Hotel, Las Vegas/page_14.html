<html><head><h3>Santa Fe Station Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 14</h3></head><body><br>Nice "locals" hotel in northern Las Vegas<p>Santa Fe Station is a nice, mid-priced hotel/casino located just off the US 95 freeway in the north-central area of Las Vegas. The rooms are the equivalent of a Holiday Inn or Marriott Courtyard. The service of the Station employees was outstanding - very friendly.

Major complaint: like many resorts in Vegas, this one charges a "hidden" mandatory $15 "resort fee" that supposedly gives the guest access to the fitness center and wireless internet service, both provided at hotels elsewhere for the quoted room rate. If the charge is mandatory, the "fee" should should be included in the room rate. This is one of the reasons Vegas is considered to be a rip-off by many guests.

Minor complaints: no coffee maker in the room, but note that the "resort fee" comes with two coupons for a small coffee at the Starbucks in the lobby.

Second: no towels are provided in the Fitness Center. The Fitness Center's equipment was clean and of recent vintage but the lack of towels seems like an odd way to cut costs.
Room Tip: Rooms facing west have a great view of the Spring Mountains but mind the heat in the summer.

First off, the place is a $45 cab ride (each way) off the strip. So if you're looking for the Vegas experience with bright lights, shows and all that Vegas is known for, this is probably not the place to go. In fact, I met an old friend who lives in the area and he stated its where the locals go to avoid the tourists.
Ok, the room. Well it was rather spartan with two queen beds that were not terribly comfortable. These were not covered in 500 count Egyptian cotton sheets. But I was staying free and won't complain. The table and chairs were rather small and the television was your standard ion bombardment tube, not a flat screen hi-def wonder. The bathroom was small, but who goes to Vegas to hang out in the bathroom. Really? The room was done up in earthy tones and was overall pretty simple (and did I mention it was free?). It WAS clean and I asked for the ironing board cover to be replaced because it had body glitter on it. They did it quickly. I didn't want to go home to explain to my wife how I got body glitter all over my clothes so I ironed them with a towel on the desk that day. I suppose body glitter is the new lipsick on the collar these days. Overall, it seemed the room was bearably comfortable. That is by design, I'm sure, so you'll go downstairs to the casino.
The casino was typical; row upon row of slots, blackjack and poker tables and lotsa cigarette smoke. If you play, they will feed you drinks for free. Just keep playing. There is a movie theater there too showing first run shows and there were a number of restaurants that satisfied every price point. The pool typically was small as was the workout room.
I found the staff to be attentive, efficient and friendly enough. No issues there. There just wasn't much to do in the area since it was quite far off the strip. Although we walked to Big Dogs Brew House which had some great beer. Food and libations were not free there. But it was worth the money.
If you are looking for the Vegas toursit experience don't stay here. If you want something perhaps with less hustle and bustle then this is the place. Hope this helps.
Travel On!</p><br>Mrs.<p>I just can't say enough about the wonderful staff at the Santa Fe. Our slot hostess, Renita Willis, is just out of sight! She doesn't let any detail slip past her. Not only is she so sweet, she makes sure she looks us up often and makes sure we're well taken care of.

This last trip we stayed for eight days and had a blast. We think the machines pay better at
Santa Fe and they have a great selection.

Everyone affiliated with this hotel/casino is a cut above. The desk people, the valets, the housekeeping department and even security are all very friendly and welcoming.

My husband also likes the workout room so he can keep his usual exercise routine up while I catch some extra sleep.

I wish I could remember the names of the desk people, the housekeeper, and the valets because they all go out of their way and they deserve to be specifically mentioned.

The only thing I could say against the SF would be that it seems to be time to freshen up the rooms and change the soap and shampoo. It's orange scented and I don't care to smell like an orange.

The Santa Fe ROCKS!!! Their staff is AWESOME!

Just my two cents worth.

SpenderTerry</p><br>Not a lot of good to say<p>Needed reservations fast or we were going to have to stay in a tent in 75 mph winds. We called and got recreations quickly. Room was okay standard level of clean, but it was missing all the normal stuff such as a hotel phone list and amenities guide and it was even sans paper and pen!

Went and ate at the food court, with all th smoke from the casino!

Slept great except for kids running up and down the hall and security pounding on one of their doors at 3 am.

Rooms are not technology friendly. Weak wifi and no easy accessible plugs if you several devices that need to be plugged in.

Now for the really bad part. Went to have breakfast at the Grand Cafe. Over 15 minutes to get coffee for us and two other tables. Management noticed the problem and sent in a tiger team of waiters and waitresses. We got coffee and our orders taken in just a minute. Food was served by the bus boy and we never any service again ie. "is everything okay, can I get you anything elese?" I wrote this all down and gave it to the cashier. We'll see if it gets any where. The food was so so.</p><br>Very nice hotel/casino off the strip.<p>We flew to Las Vegas on Allegiant Air for discounts, this hotel was recommended. We really liked it here. It was about 10 miles from the stip of Las Vegas, so we could go to shows and shop at our leisure as we rented a car. We booked a trip to Grand Canyon and also drove to Santa Barbara CA. This hotel had a lot to offer: quite heated pool and hot tub. A varitety of resturants, bowling alley, Starbucks, a mega plex movie theatre,,,,and of course a Casino.
We would definetely go back again =)
Room Tip: A great place to bring kids to if you are coming as a family.
See more room tips</p><br>the only place left-<p>this hotel is terrible-the service sucks. we reserved our rooms months in advance with not benefits at all. the hotel was sold out for the weekend we came. there was 1 lady at the registration desk at all times. Carla. The only nice employee I encountered in my 3 day stay. she answers all the telephones and does the check ins at the same time-VERY SLOW and UNDERSTAFFED. Of course they did not get me the adjoining room as I requested. OF course they overcharged my credit card and now trying to clear that up goes straight to voicemail. there is only one person in the hotel to help me with that I suppose. they over priced all their rooms for our group of 40 ish rooms- I would NEVER stay there again. BTW the placed reeked of smoke and our soccer daughters were scared of the creepers lurking....
Room Tip: don't bring your swimming suit. the pool is the size of a postage stamp and its located by the...
See more room tips</p><br>What is that smell?<p>Just spent last weekend at Santa Fe Station while in town for a soccer tournament. Not by choice, it was one of the required tournament contracted hotels. This is a tired, old hotel with really poor ventilation, in need of complete remodel. Besides the heavy smoke there was another underlying smell, a combination of mildew and outhouse, that lingered throughout the hotel. Sad, scary patons in the casino. You could easily spot who else was in town for the soccer tournament, they stood out like flowers in a bed of weeds. Rooms are drab, tiny bathrooms, dirty carpets, beds concerning. On a positive note, the staff was friendly and helpful, from the valet, to the front desk, to the restaurants and casino. Kudos to them for keeping a positive attitude in such a dreary place.</p><br>Decent, friendly place to stay in Vegas<p>We stayed at the Santa Fe Station in March for our granddaughter's softball tournament. It was nothing fancy but it met our needs, was affordable, close to the ball fields and family friendly. My favorite thing about this hotel/casino was the friendliness of all the employees. Our first night there the team wanted to eat dinner together at Cabo, the Mexican restaurant. There were about 30 of us in the party and even though they didn't take reservations, they were able to seat us in a seperate room very quickly. We asked for separate checks for each family and though they didn't normally do that, they agreed because they saw that it was very important to us. The employees at the gaming tables were some of the friendliest people we've ever played with at any casino, especially the group at the craps table! They welcomed every player that walked up to the table and called them by name if they had their player card with them. It made everyone feel very at home. They really made it a fun time. Having the food court, bowling alley, kid zone and movie theaters right there in the building was GREAT for the kids and it allowed the parents to have fun too! Unfortunately it was too cold to swim in the pool. A group of us also ate at the Grand Cafe and the food there was very affordable and very good with a wide variety on the menu. The only negative was the smokey air which is hard to get away from unless it's a newer hotel with better ventalation. Even though the hotel itself was a no-frills place, I rated it a 4 out of 5 because of the friendly employees and good customer service at all levels.</p><br>worst hotel ever!!<p>Truly the worst dump ever! I left there with a whole lot of bug bites all over my back and back of my legs. Can't say for certain it was bed bugs, but everything points in that direction. Upon arrival home, everything went directly from the garage into the washer and all luggage was sprayed with bug spray inside and out! Dirty carpets, tiny bathroom. No matter what "bargain" rate you get, it's just not worth it. Never again.</p><br>Good price--tired hotel--tough beds<p>My wife and I stayed at the Santa Fe Station even after reading the negative reviews. Our opinion--room price was good, check-in easy and pleasant staff, valet staff very helpful, food at the cafe--very good, fair price. BUT--the room had no phone?? I went down to the front desk, now with only one person on it at 7PM on a Friday night--she said she'd take care of it. Still no phone the next morning. The room, old and outdated but the bed was so bad my wife had me check us out the following morning--she couldn't do a second night on that bed! So, not a choice we would ever make again--regardless of the price--we are trying to cancel a up coming reservation, awaiting response.</p><br></body></html>
