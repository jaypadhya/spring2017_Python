<html><head><h3>Santa Fe Station Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 11</h3></head><body><br>Not the best by far<p>The bathrooms are tiny, the tub is nothing to write home about. My TV didnt work, and maintenance had to come up twice to get it to work. Somebody didnt tell them it was fixed, and i got woke up at 1 am by them coming to work on the room again. The folks at the check in desk were very nice, and kept appoligizing about the mishaps, but it still was an inconvience. Buffet was spot on, and may have been the best part of the experience.
Room Tip: check and make sure everything works early in the day so they can fix it.

Thanks to Selena at reception who checked me out in a flash, just the way I like it, since I'm on the run 99% of the time!</p><br>Comfy bed and good buffet.<p>The beds at this hotel are so soft that I had no problem getting some sweet rest. However, for a hotel/casino the pool was subpar. Expect to get charged a $14/day hotel amenity fee :(. I enjoyed the breakfast buffet which was good food at a good price with excellent service. They also give you a free drink at Starbucks, but no free coffee in the rooms.</p><br>Great stay at the Santa Fe<p>I stayed in this hotel in 2 different rooms at two different times during the week (Sunday-Tuesday, and Thursday night). Check in was very easy with the front desk staff being very nice. The room was a typical room with 2 queen beds. The bathroom was a little small comparatively to some other hotels but it was clean and worked well. The casino was pretty big and it did take me awhile to learn my way around the place. There were plenty of options for food. A starbucks, fatburger, johnny rockets, a wings place, sub shop, a cafe, buffet, and a Mexican restaurant. There were also some restaurants near the hotel as well. It is a little far from the strip, but if you want to take a bus to the strip the stop is right outside the hotel. I was suprised that it didn't smell as smokey as I would have thought it to have smelled. Very pleased with my stay.
Room Tip: The casino is on the first floor so if you want to be farther from the smoke stay in a higher floor.

Air vent rattled very loud. Bathroom was horrible design. Toilet very awkward position. Delivery trucks (beep, beep, beep) woke me up as they backed up next to the hotel for early morning deliveries. Maintaince has portable buildings next to hotel that are a huge eyesore and they make noise all day long. Not even worth staying for free. By the way food prices are very high and casino is very tight, after all its a station casino property.</p><br>Pleasant Place<p>I was out driving on highway 95 retuning from a trip up to Mt. Charleston and came across this casino. I was pleasantly surprised to see how large this place is. It was spotless and there were many slot machines of all denominations. What was very nice is they have a movie theater and a bowling alley inside with many places to eat. I decided to see a movie, as it was Tuesday which is senior day and movies are $4.00 from 11:00 to 4:00....not bad, for seniors anyway.

I would certainly come back and explore this place more. Have no clue how the rooms are, but based on the cleanliness of the casino I can only assume they are nice and prices are probably fair.</p><br>Nice Business Stay<p>First visit to Sante Fe Station and enjoyed our business stay very much. Check in was a bit delayed as only one front desk person was working but he was very efficient, accurate, and professional. Our room was a non-smoking King and was comfortable, clean and large enough. Bathroom was small and outdated but very clean and workable. The room location was very quiet throughout the day and evening and was easy to get to. After our business meetings we enjoyed the Casino which is much larger than it appears from the outside view. Every employee we interacted with during our 3 day stay were very pleasant,helpful, and seemed to really enjoy being at work. Everyone from the front desk, housekeeping, food services, and security were outstanding. We visited the larger hotels near and on the strip and were happy to make the 10 minute drive back to Sante Fe Station where we were treated much better. The morning buffet was outstanding as was the service and we especially enjoyed our dinner experience at the Charcoal Steakhouse, the entire party enjoyed their meals with the salmon and prime rib 3 course meals gaining the highest marks. For sure we will return to the Sante Fe Station when visiting Las Vegas again.
Room Tip: Early week very good rates
See more room tips</p><br>You get what you pay for....<p>Had lunch with my girlfriend and daughter about a month ago before going bowling.... Best part about the lunch was the "Grilled Cheese" my little girl had, and enjoy listening to a few "older folks from Summerlin", complain until the manager gave them something for free?! The server was good, and was pretty much on time, but the food was definently mediocre at best. Be sure to ask for very lite dressing when it comes to ordering the cesaer salad, because it's so thick that its almost pasty. As for the bowling alley.... We had a good time, but it was understaffed, and the wait time was approximately 45 minutes while 1 guy scrambled to answer the phone, listen too complaints, and keep taking next in line reservations. (Deep fried Oreo Sundae at the Cafe was pretty good, so that was the high light of the trip!)</p><br>Sad $15 per day for a Newspaper called an Aminity Fee???<p>Rented 2 rooms to be close to family over the holodays fo the kids..
Rooms maybe a one or 2 star at best, Lamp chain missing (Flashlight.....) out of coffee makers..... shower did work Would not have complained or felt so used had it not been for the $14.99 added per day per room as an amenity fee.. what do you get? since this is deffinately not a resort... Why, you get a free newspaper AND 10% off in the gift shop!! WOW!!!</p><br>Grand Cafe Sante Fe Station Las Vegas<p>Went for breakfast at the Grand Cafe in Sante Fe Station
Waiter was friendly and menu looked good, But it ended there when my Bloody Mary came 5 minutes after other drinks were served. Huevos Ranchero had a serrano pepper on top that was barely roasted unpeeled and cold as well as the tortillas burned. The corned beef and scrambled eggs were unedible as the eggs were loose and watered down as well as the Corned Beef Hash burnt and black and they served it. Chef should not send this out and waiter should not have served it.
Sent my food back and left.</p><br></body></html>
