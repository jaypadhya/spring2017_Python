<html><head><h3>Santa Fe Station Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 13</h3></head><body><br>Clean rooms,friendly staff<p>I am a local so I normally stay on the strip. However, had to go to wedding in northwest vegas. Santa Fe was clean, accomodating, staff was always more than willing to help and the price was right. We had free vouchers to bowling and some free slot play. Nice for a little get away and very close to hwy 95.
Room Tip: No Room Service. But, 24 cafe was great food and great price. No inconveniance at all! ! !
See more room tips</p><br>If you're going to Vegas with the kids, two thumbs up!<p>Went to vegas for a wedding anniversary/family reunion so of course we had to bring the kids and it was in N. Vegas, Santa Fe Station was recommended so we took a look. Price was right, hotel is extremely clean, as most Station casinos are but we were surprised at the size of the casino and amenities for the kids. Kids Quest was a great safe place to drop the kids off for a little adult fun time, tons of stuff for them to do. They've also got a bowling alley, arcade and movie theater. 15 mins from SFS to the south strip and very close to the freeway. If you're looking to stay off the strip and take the kids, SFS is highly recommended.</p><br>Buffet<p>As a local, I'm disappointed how the buffet is being managed. There are two sides for cashiers. One for the regular people and handicaps and one for the "high rollers"! Usually nobody in line at the high roller side but the rest of us must wait. All the time watching the other cashier do absolutely nothing. It's simple, put the handicap along with the high roller side, and call over the regulars when they can, to help out. Also, why do they have a bright hot light on the salad plates or very hot when they bring out more? Very bad. The food quality is also going down hill. The salad bar is not as good as it used to be. Who wants oranges that are cut? How about some fresh fruit? No soup spoons most of the time. The food in general is WAY to salty. The sign says pork, it should say "fat". This buffet needs a manager who can get it together. After all, they say they "love locals". Do they really?</p><br>Very disappointed,...again<p>This is the second time that I’m staying in this Hotel. The only reason,…it’s close to my work while I’m in Las Vegas. At first everything looks nice until you get off the elevator and start heading down the hall to your room. The carpet is really dirty, with big stains and a grey something all around the edges.
The room carpet doesn’t look anything different. Huge stains! All the carpeting looks like it hasn’t been cleaned in years. The bed was actually very comfortable and clean. No complaints there at all!
The bathroom is very tiny and has poor or no ventilation. It takes forever for the mirror to clear up. The shower walls, which are natural tile, must be on the same cleaning schedule as the rugs in the hotel. The stuff what’s on the tiles is not hard water stains but soap scum and shampoo stains and who knows what, in the grout. The bath floor isn’t any better. I wonder what the original grout color was? Right now it goes from a scum grey to brown to black. There were several black mold areas where the tub meets the shower walls. You might want to use a robber glove to move the shower head. Sticky stuff up on top and the nozzles haven’t been cleaned out since they cleaned the rugs and shower walls. YUK!
I will never stay here again!</p><br>Away from EVERYTHING!<p>This hotel was bad, really bad. This hotel was occupied by mainly locals and the cigarette smoke; worse than any casino in Vegas! Definitely not family orientated, there is nothing to do outside of the hotel. About a $40-50 cab ride to Fremont Street (Old Vegas). If you plan on staying here, don’t expect to go anywhere outside the hotel unless you have a vehicle or don’t mind paying a lot for a cab ride. Will not stay here again!</p><br>You get what you pay for<p>This hotel was cheap, l give them that but the rooms were unclean. Even the non smoking floor smelled smokey. The carpet in our room was disgusting, my two year old sons socks were black after walking around for a short amount of time. The casino was even worse smoke wise. I may have some kind of cancer now from the filth in the air. The walls are paper thin, I can tell you about each of my room neighbors and when they entered or left their rooms. On the more positive side the breakfast buffet was excellent. Definitely worth getting a boarding pass card for the discount. Down side, even if they gave me a comp on another stay I would not take it. Aliante station looked far better and I'll pay thirty extra a night for cleaner accommodations. So if you're a fire breather this is the place for you. If your homeless then this is your kinda gig. If you have kids and care about your health go elsewhere.</p><br>NIGHTMARE ON RANCHO DRIVE!!!<p>I'm sorry, but I can't see how anyone could possibly say that their stay here was pleasant or even that they got what they paid for here!

We stayed here June 15th and 16th (2012) as it was listed in our State Trap Shoot information as the place that gave the best group rates, plus it was close to the shooting range.

My total for two nights stay at this 'wonderful' Hotel/Casino (myself and 17 year old grandson) was $199.34!!! They tacked on all kinds of additional fees...amenity fees...service fees!!! A motel 6 would have had better accommodations! The LONG, smelly hallways and elevators weren't air-conditioned! It's 106 degrees outside and for this price I think it would have been only fair to have the whole dump air-conditioned! Let me begin at the start...

We arrived and parked in a lot outside because we couldn't find a place to park and enter the hotel to register. A long , hot walk in itself! We got to the front desk and the ONE employee had our room ready. We registered and she gave us two card keys. We asked her where we could park. She told us that our room was on the 3rd floor, so we could park on the 3rd level of the garage. Okay then, sounds like we can enter the 3rd floor to our hotel from the parking garage...NO SUCH LUCK! The garage elevators have one setting....LOBBY! We had to go back to the lobby...walk through all the smoking gamblers to the room elevators. We finally made it to the room and slid our key into the slot...nothing. Again...nothing...again and again and again! Really? Grandson tried his a couple of times and it finally allowed us to enter. We cranked up the air-conditioning and I went down the hot hallway to get ice at the ice station only to be met with a sign taped to it that said that the ice machine was broken and I would have to use the machine on the 2nd floor. When I got back, my key still wouldn't work! Thank the Lord my grandson was in the room to let me in.

It should be mentioned at this point that several people stopped after seeing I was having trouble with my key and said that they were having trouble with their keys also. Okay, we finally got everything from the car to the room and the grandson left with friends to 'explore' and I went down stairs and told the desk clerk that I needed a new key because mine wouldn't work. She gave me a new key and I headed back to my room. Guess what? Yep! It didn't work either! I tried and tried and was frazzled! There was an emergency phone in the hall way and I called the number. I told the man who answered my problem and told him that I was tired of going up and down the elevator and would he mind helping me open my door? He said he was on his way. He arrived, asked for my ID and checked his roster. then used a magic key to let me in! My key didn't work the whole time we were there. I made sure my grandson was with me when I needed to re-enter the room!

Friday night we went to the Cafe for dinner and it was a lovely experience...really! The first time I was truly happy since we arrived! The food was great and the service was excellent!

Saturday evening, my grandson went to the theater with friends. I made sure he had his key because I am taking pain pills for an injured knee and I always sleep with ear plugs. I went to bed and woke up at 1:00 a.m. and he wasn't in the room. I knew the movie was a long one and he was with friends so I didn't worry. Woke again at 3:00 and still no grandson. I called him on his cell and he was walking the casino because his key wouldn't work in the door!!! He couldn't wake me and didn't think about calling the room or asking for any help. He said he tried about 15 different times to use his key but to no avail! I let him in and we both finally got some sleep.

Breakfast at the Cafe Sunday morning. We packed most of our things and then went to the Cafe at 10:30. Check out time wasn't until noon so we thought we had plenty of time. The Cafe told us we had about a 20 minute wait and gave us a little page device. The grandson decided to use that time to load the car while I waited at the Cafe. I had only been seated for a few minutes when he returned. The maid had to let him in the room each time he returned from the car to the room! His key still wasn't working!!!

We ordered breakfast and WAITED!!!!!! Tables that were seated AFTER us were getting their food while we WAITED!!! The waitress apologized and said that there was a long wait due to such a large crowd. Guess what people...it's Father's Day...wouldn't you have extra help on a day like this??? DUH!!! Time was getting away from us and so I went to the front desk and checked out then went back to the Cafe. Finally, the breakfast arrived and it wasn't worth the wait or the price! Ummmmm...$2.99 for an English muffin? No butter no jam no cream cheese...just a dry old toasted English muffin! Please note that we didn't order anything special, just plain old French toast and bacon and I ordered an English muffin and bacon. We walked out of the Cafe at 12:30...2 hours from start to finish!

This place isn't worth the stay! Do yourself a favor and book at a Motel 6... at least you'll get what you pay for.

Last thought...the waitresses and workers were ALL very nice and always smiling...too bad they don't have their own hotel/casino...I might consider staying there if they were running the place!
Room Tip: Don't stay here!
See more room tips</p><br>Zombies do exist.<p>The hotel room itself was nice. The front desk staff were pleasant and efficient. Also, the rate was low (36.00). But watch out for the zombies. As soon as you enter the building, I swear you will be overwhelmed by the sheer volume of zombie activity. And they are all playing the slots, with at least one cigarette dangling out of the side of each of their rotting mouths. As you pass by them, they occasionally look up and briefly glance at you with cold, unfeeling eyes, but don't worry--they then go back to spending their social security checks and liquidated 401k if left undisturbed.</p><br>Off the beaten path<p>This place is really a locals place, but it was a really nice place. The casino floor was pretty big, I would say bigger than NYNY for sure. It seemed to be recently updated as well. The hotel rooms are pretty bland, but it's fairly cheap so don't expect too much there. They have a number of places to eat at the hotel and the staff is very friendly. I wouldn't suggest this place to a Vegas first timer because you don't get the real Vegas experience because it is a ways off of the strip, I mean a $60-80 cab ride from the airport.</p><br>Read all the reviews prior to booking.....<p>(Date April 18-21)
I was travelling with my husband, 6 year old and 6 month old. My parents were set on staying at this casino, I did not want to. My husband formally lived in Vegas for many years and we both knew that this wasn't a great place to stay.
Check In: We were able to check in right away, but they didn't sign us up for the boarding pass (they signed up both my parents) so we had to make seperate trips to the rewards desk. I was aware of the 12.99 amenity fee but not that the fee itself was taxed result in a higher charge of $14.18. We were told that valet would help us with our bags, but when we went back to our car was told there was no one able to assist and offered us a luggage cart. I was totally fine with this. I only received 1 starbucks coupon, but I think that we were supposed to get one for every day we said.


Hotel Room: I booked thru a 3rd party but called the week prior to arrival to request a 2 queen non smoking room and a fridge. They advised me that the rooms were assigned at check in and they would try to accommodate. The room smelled a bit like smoke but was on a non smoking floor. I found the room to be a good size, and had a view of the teeny tiny pool. The beds no longer have the comforter shown in the pics, but sheets wrapped around a blanket (for cleanliness). The fridge was brought up within an hour of checking in, which is a bummer cause it took quite a few hours to chill.

I saw that there was laundry listed on the website, which I thought meant laundry facilities and I was incorrect and did not pack enough clothes for everyone. They did offer a send out fluff and fold but was afraid to ask how much money. My room was clean but found a few stray hairs on the bathroom that didn't belong to any of us. My parents also booked 2 rooms (3rd floor) which we found some weird, and large items that weren't vacuumed up. There are also no plugs near the table in the room, the tv had very limited channels and the menu button was broken on our remote. I also noticed that our clock was set about 12 minutes fast in the room, as well as my parents room. Which is irritating as I kept arriving to meet everyone in the casino locations super early.

While walking the halls, I could hear conversations from inside the room and some spanish music from the same room, day after day. The halls are very long and I ended up using the stairs frequently to get from the 4th to the 3rd floor, as it was less mileage than using the elevator at the end. The housekeepers were all nice and social. I had to call or ask several times for fresh towels and wash clothes (we had 2 towels/washcloths for 4 people?). I am sure that this is the hotels policy not the housekeepers fault.

The website said pillow top mattresses, this seemed true in my parents room but not mine. There was only 2 small pillows on each bed.

There was a bit of graffiti ("sex" written in black ink or crayon) next to the elevator on the 4th floor which stayed there the entire time. I am kicking myself now cause I meant to take a picture of it to post with the review.


Pool: The pool is a very long walk pass the employee break area outside, which most everyone was smoking while we walked. My husband found a "short cut" by exiting through the fire staircase but you could not get back in that way. The pool is tiny with a cute water fall. The chairs are pretty filthy but the changing area/restroom was nice.


Cabo Mexican Restaurant: Was seated quickly at 7pm-ish. Our server was very slow, when we finally received our food, we could tell the plates had been waiting a while. The rice and the enchilada sauce were both dried out. The server took forever for anything, and I noticed a lady waiting so long for a refill that she got up and got the water pitcher herself. We asked if they had Splenda before ordering tea, and found later it was a generic splenda made for stations casino that was inferior. The whole ordeal took and 1.5 hrs to dine which was torture.


Grand Cafe: My first experience was good with the cafe, we had a large group and ate fairly quickly. My 2.99 Caesar wrap was fine, they didn't ask me what size Perrier I wanted and I received a gigantic 1.5 liter bottle which I took back to my room. My 2nd experience the next day was sub par. We waited over 5 minutes to be seated at 2pm, with the emergency system blaring on the PA. There was only 5 in our group and it took over 1.5 hrs from start to finish. My mom and I both ordered the 2.99 specials, but she was told she could not order only water with the meal. Which is strange because both my sisters ordered drinks (soda and a expensive virgin drink)which would have sufficed for the promo. Our waitress was very slow and not competent. I ordered the children's BURGER for my daughter add cheese. It arrived as 2 sliders, no cheese and later my daughter told me the burger meat was very tough. She was starving and hardly touched it. My mom's and my burger top bun was stale. It was hard on the outside but not on the interior. My sister ordered some type of club sandwich that had UNCOOKED bacon on it, which being a teen she went on a hunger strike. We waited a long time for the bill and eventually my mom sent us upstairs to get ready for the party while she waited. The club sandwich ended up getting removed from the bill.


Buffet: The buffet wait was about 10-15 minutes for a Thursday night. The food was terrible and not worth whatever price my dad paid. I noticed one the employees in the dessert area was getting mad when the customers were propping the spatulas up on the dessert trays and she kept slamming them down on the glass after the diner walked away. The only redeeming thing was that the drink server was very prompt and she also found our baby's toy we left behind on accident.


Bowling: The service was great, the guy was attentive. He did not offer bumpers to my small child so we called after the game started to get them. We also asked for a ramp which he brought to us.


Rewards Desk: My husband signed up for a boarding pass and was given an information card as well at $3 free play. When I went to get a boarding pass, all I was handed was a card. No information or $3 free play was given.


Check Out: I sent my husband to get the cart so that we could take everything to the car. He was told that they were not to be lent out and that they would send someone when we were ready. When I was done sorting and packing everything, we called and were told to wait 20 minutes. My awesome husband used our stroller to help get everything downstairs instead.


Overall, was not impressed and would not stay there again.</p><br></body></html>
