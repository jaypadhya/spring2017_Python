<html><head><h3>Santa Fe Station Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 18</h3></head><body><br>Better than these reviews say<p>I was aprehensive about staying here after reading the negative reviews, but I actually thought it was a good place, especially for the price!
First thing is that it is off the strip (20 min drive), so if you're planning on spending alot of time on the strip this is not the place to stay.
The room was large and spacious, the bathroom on the otherhand was tidy (but clean and adequate).
There is the $14.95 daily resort fee, but this is common across Vegas properties and if you have a look at Vegas.com, the fee here actually probably gives you better value.
There is no bar fridge which was disappointing, but I understand once again that this is common for Vegas.
There are plenty of food options available in the Casino, but if you have a car it is a 5 min drive to Centennial center which has many options, fast food, chain and other resturants.
For the price you pay, I think the Santa Fe Station is good value for money.</p><br>Resort Fees? Breakfast Rip Off... Never again.<p>This hotel charges a $15 a day "Resort Fee". My room - a Bed and Breakfast deal - was $39 a day PLUS this exorbitant extortion fee. When I checked in, I was told what that "fee" covered and I asked to opt out of all that because I didn't need any of what they offered. Uncaring, not listening, they just said "No". Now, you would think that when you signed up for the Bed and Breakfast deal, and you stayed there for four nights that you would get breakfast every morning... you would be WRONG! On our second day it was explained to us that the breakfast deal was for the "first day only". What kind of BS is that? The rooms are old and run down, the bathrooms are very small and I had to call the maids back to my room once to vacuum. For $39 a night, the rooms are worth it. But add the $15 and tax and you are at $60 a night and you can do much better someplace else.</p><br>Sant Fe Station<p>The Santa Fe Station is a smaller community casino. It is clean and well kept. It is not crowded. It is easy to drive to and is out of the crowd of traffic that is seen on the strip. The food courts and restaurants are attractive and serve good food. The movie theater adds to the convenience of the stay. There is also a bowling alley. There is a place for children to play. The hotel staff are unobtrusive but are always there and willing to take care of any need. The security staff were available if a need arose.</p><br>We had a great stay!<p>We were in the area for a National girls fastpitch tournament. The hotel was close to the fields and the price was right! There are movie theaters, a bowling alley and a food court located at the hotel. The pool isn't very big.</p><br>Boy....What can I say that was good....<p>I guess it would be that the security people were so nice. We checked into the hotel early in the morning and used the valet parking. We unloaded our own luggage which is fine but when we got inside to check in we had 6 adults and three sleeping babies with no offer at all for help. We was tired and signed our papers and was asked for our credit card even though our rooms were prepaid. When i asked why I was told in case there was any more charges like long distance or other things. When we arrived in our rooms they was very clean and neat but very warm. The next night we arrived back to the hotel and it was still very warm also in the other rooms we booked. It was about 11:30 and we called the front desk to ask where we could get a tooth brush and was told one would be sent up and we also told them our AC was not working , 15 minutes later we received a call to tell us no one could deliver the tooth brush but we could go to the front desk and get it. We waited an hour and called the front desk again about the AC and was told they would send someone up. About 1 o'clock two guys finally arrived and said that they have to manually turn the heat off and the AC on in the rooms. When we checked out we was then charged an extra $14.17 a day to use the internet or any of the other hotel services. So we ended up paying an extra $57 on top of the $286. we already paid. They said when we signed in we agreed to the extra charge but was never informed at 1 in the morning that we would be charged extra. Being on a tight budget that was my gas money to go home on. The hotel management was uncaring about the extra charges and the AC and wait time on getting it fixed. Then they charged my card $100. per room, ($200 for both my rooms) and said they would put back on the card what I don't use. What the heck....</p><br>Not as bad as all that!<p>We have stayed at Santa Fe Station a number of times. The rooms are basic but they are big enough, the bathrooms are small as reported however, with little counter space. Beds are comfortable. I never noticed a smoky smell in the rooms or anything less than cleanliness. The elevators are a bit slow, but since the hotel is not overly crowded this isn't really a problem. The buffet is very good. Have never had a problem getting free drinks while I was playing in the casino. All staff is friendly, never had a problem with that either. We don't feel the casino is "tight" -- it's still a better shake than some place on the Strip. You get a free paper every morning on your door and there is a small but new fitness room available for your use. It's very easy to get from parking garage to your room and to the casino. No bells & whistles here, but it's comfortable, with a convenient location near the freeway.</p><br>Beware!!! Flight Cancelled? Family Emergency? This Property Will Still Charge You A One Night Late Change/Cancelation Fee!<p>When I found out my flight was cancelled due to a mechanical malfunction, I immediately called Santa Fe Station. I wasn't even going to cancel my reservation, just push my arrival date for the next day. After being put on hold for over 10 minutes, I hung up, went to their website, and e-mailed reservations about my situation, and left it at that.

The next afternoon, I arrived at the property and was told by Selena, the Front Desk Agent, that Santa Fe Station has a 48 hour cancellation policy and since I didn't change my reservation within that period prior to my arrival, I was charged for the night before. Selena, obviously aware of my immediate dismay, showed not one ounce of sympathy or understanding of my position. Just kept repeating the 'policy' while cutting me off mid-sentence as I'm trying to explain to her what happened with my flight. When it was clear that she was in control and there was nothing I could do at that moment, I let her check me in. While she was on the computer, and not lecturing me, I shot off a question "So, if your flight is cancelled, or there's a family emergency and you check-out a day early, everyone is charged for late changes or cancellation?" Her answer was simply, and with more vigor than before, "Yes. Like I keep telling you, we have a 48 hour cancellation policy..."

Looks like I picked the one hotel in America that charges a one night late change/cancellation fee regardless if a situation arrises that's within your control or not. And, if you don't get why they're policy is the way it is, then they've got Selena over there to make sure that you understand it.</p><br>Did not stay here, but good conference facilities<p>While I did not stay at this hotel (it was a long distance from the strip), I was at this hotel/casino for a training. The conference rooms are upstairs and very nice. Our event was catered by the hotel, and the food was very good. The negative is walking through the smoke filled casino to get to the conference rooms upstairs- which thank goodness do not have the smoke feel. As you leave the second floor from the conference rooms you can tell halfway down the escaltor the 'smoke layer' begins.
If you want to enjoy the Vegas attractions, this might be a bit far out for you (with good traffic it's a 15 min drive by freeway). If you are looking for a nice place to have a conference/meeting away from the strip with good food, this is the place!!</p><br>Fair for what it is<p>My wife and I stayed here while we were intown visitng family. There are two parking garages . Valet park and park at the one next to the lobby check in. The other one is way on the other side from where you check in, if you park there you will have a looong walk with your luggage. I think it would be shorter to walk to the strip then the check in area (being sarcastic here).

The room- The room was average, bathroom small and very little counter space. To me it smelled like smoke, my wife said she didnt really notice it. The towels provided were small. No fridge in the rooom but a lot of hotels dont include those anymore. The one thing about the room that drove me crazy was that in december it is cold in vegas which means you have to turn on the heater. It seemed like it would never shut off! so we had to turn it off when we went to sleep and turn it on in the middle of the night when the room became Ice cold. Which meant we were getting in and out of bed to turn on and off the thermostat.

Food- We only ate at the grand cafe once. service was horrible, and the food mediocure. It took over an hour to get our order and there were not many people in the resturaunt. We ate most of our meals somewhere else. In the past we have eaten at the Charcol room and that was very good but also very pricey. Would never eat at the cafe again!

Ammenities- It was nice that they had a movie theater attached so we were able to see a couple of movies after spending time with family. We didnt use the bowling alley and it was too cold for the pool. This is a locals hotel so dont compare it to the ones on the strip. Its not glamourous.They do have penny slots-havent seen those in a while.. They also have a starbucks in the casino which was very nice for my morning coffee!

Overall- this hotel was fair, not the worst I have stayed in but not the best either. They have room for improvement. They should move the parking garage back to the other side so you dont have the long treck to the room. I might stay here again because it is close to family I was visiting. If your visiting vegas for the action on the strip this hotel is a long way away and I cannot recomend it for that. Overall its not a bad hotel.</p><br>Try to avoid this hotel!<p>This is the kind of hotel that would be good to stay at if you just want to eat and gamble. the rooms are not nice - the bathroom is so small and even the non-smoking rooms smell like smoke - all the linens, towels, etc. smell like smoke. They do have some nice places to eat - the food court is great for a quick bite. The smoke everywhere is typical Vegas, but this is really much worse than other hotels I have stayed at. Also, if you are planning on going to the Strip, do not stay here. It is a $55 - $60 cab ride to the airport, and about the same to the strip. You will want to rent a car if you will be going back and fourth to the strip. I would just spend the extra $20 or so a night and stay on the strip. No room service - although they advertise they do have room service - they do not. This was just a bad stay all around - bad neighborhood, too. The pool is so small and hard to get to it's not even worth using. Ugh. I will not stay here again and will not recommend this place to anyone.</p><br></body></html>
