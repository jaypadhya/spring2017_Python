<html><head><h3>Santa Fe Station Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 9</h3></head><body><br>ok not great<p>This place has a nice Casino, but the rooms sure could use some updating!! The Dining options were great, the staff was nice, all Rooms smell of smoke, old and dated. We stayed in March and the place was close to golf and that is way we stayed there.</p><br>Bad Air Quality<p>What hit me first was the strong smell of smoke as you approach the doors of the Hotel/Casino. It's "old school" HVAC systems here. I was surprised that it was so strong. I stayed on the 5th floor "non smoking" floor but the bad air extended to this floor (to a much lesser degree) as well. The receptionist was very nice and check in fast. When exiting the elevator and walking the hall to our room, it was very noticeable that the hall had not been vacuumed that day. It wasn't something we looked for, it was just that noticeable. The room itself was ok and not too dated. The bathroom was extremely small with little countertop space. What we did notice was the stain on the white sheets that although cleaned, was still apparent. There was lots of dust on the carpets around the edges of the carpet where the vacuum doesn't reach without an attachment. I was a little disappointed in that I had stayed at another Station Hotel that was much nicer. Again, my number one issue is the poor air quality followed by the cleanliness / maintenance of the rooms. Although I paid a fairly high price when I stayed, If the rooms were $29 to $49 per night, I might feel I got what I could expect in that price range. Also, I would have felt much more comfortable with a room safe. I want to add that casino and theaters, bowling, and food options were good, but I really had trouble with the air quality.
Room Tip: Elevators are not central to the rooms. Some rooms are far from the elevators. Noisy HVAC units in r...

It's a nice, quieter place away from the Strip. The room was comfortable and the bed was decent. The bathroom was a little too small and hard to get in and out of with the door. The casino was nice though. We don't normally gamble, but my friend got us to play $1 Keno and we had a blast. There's also plenty of attached restaurants and a food court along with a night club if you're into that sort of thing. If you're looking for a place away from the craziness of the Strip, this is a good place to go.</p><br>Great value and quality<p>I stayed at Santa Fe for a week with my wife and infant daughter. We had read a lot of negative reviews about this hotel and were concerned about the room and casino being smoky and the room being unclean and in poor repair. Our experience was completely different. We travel to LV regularly and have stayed in many hotels and this was one of the nicest ones within this price range. Our room was clean, comfortable, and spacious. We had plenty of room to navigate with the stroller. All of our requests were met within a timely manner (refrigerator, extra towels, assistance with the closed captioning on the TV, extended checkout). The staff were professional and pleasant. We had low expectations for the buffet, but it worked very well for us. We ate there daily and were impressed with the options to eat healthful food while on vacation. My wife, who is vegetarian, had no problem finding plenty of food and praised the availability of fresh fruit, steamed vegetables, and vegetarian protein sources. The casino did not seem smokier than any other LV casino. We appreciated that there were two family restrooms in the casino, one near the buffet and one near the registration, which made it easy to change the baby when we were on the main floor. We had a mountain view from our room. The hotel is located within a 5 minute drive from groceries, TJ Maxx, Dollar Tree, and Lowe's, so really just about everything you need. We did not have a chance to see the movies or use the bowling alley at the hotel, but it was nice to know they were there. All in all, a good family hotel.
Room Tip: We liked being near the elevators. Request a room with a mountain view, but be prepared that you may...
See more room tips</p><br>amenity tax<p>My wife and I stayed in room 317 last night. I called and asked at the Hotel if there would be a charge for internet service. The person who at the Hotel assured me, who spoke very poor English, there would be no charge. At check in time the clerk said every room is charged a $14.55 with tax amenity tax, no exceptions. When I got to the room not one of our four electronic devices would connect to the Hotels server. I spent 30 minutes on the phone with the Hotel IT person but I finally gave up and did without internet service. No coffee in the room. Avoid this Hotel.
Santa Fe Station and all of there properties should just add the fee to the room rate not add it on later and make it a surprise. My wife and I will never stay at any of these properties again. It is also 12 miles from the LV strip. I am sure there at cheaper alternatives closer to the strip.</p><br>Former Local stays off the Strip; good stay<p>Santa Fe Station was the closest casino to my home when I lived in Las Vegas. We often went to the movies, buffet, and sports book here. At first I didn't want to stay here because of that - It's my old neighborhood. But overall, I was very pleased with my stay. The coupon book is excellent, my room was nice and quiet and clean, and we actually had a distant view of the Strip :) I forgot how smoky the casino floor is. I felt, and know, that I smelled like a casino. But, that's the case at all of them. We enjoyed the convenience this hotel offers regarding access to the freeway. It will take you about 20 minutes to get to the Strip when there is no traffic. It's also super easy to get downtown, which was a major highlight of my trip. Also close by is Retro Bakery, so if you like cupcakes and you are staying here, you MUST GO. It is worth the effort. And, consider driving up to Mt. Charleston to hike. You are halfway there and it's so beautiful up there. Loved BINGO. We went to the 9:00 am session, and it was pretty amusing.
Hospitality was wonderful. I, as other reviewers have noted, was confused by the wifi thing. They say it's complimentary but when you try to retrieve it, it says there is a charge. Pretty sneaky. I just gave up. As a guest, you shouldn't have to ask for refund on something.
Great stay. I love Las Vegas. It has half of my heart.</p><br>dont be fooled<p>...by the low rate offered online. it really doesn't include the taxes and resort fees. so that cheap room I booked for $21 really was more like $40. and the wifi that was 'included in the resort fee' was 5.99. when I inquired about this the next morning, I was told it would have been reversed. I could have worked that night... it was centrally located in the northwest community, food nearby. the hotel was smoky and the rooms a little smelly. it was quiet on the Tuesday night I was there. would I stay again, probably, going in knowing what i'm getting is best.</p><br>Unhappy Camper<p>I'm giving it 1 star for this reason only. Booked an ADA room in September for 3 days over Christmas. After inspection of my room, found out ADA rooms were not available for 2 nights or so. I was told by front desk that they can not make people leave that are already in those type of rooms, even if they extend their stay and knowing that they have rooms reserved. I suggested another room at a sister property, seemed like a hassle. I also asked if the hotel has extra bath/shower chairs so I can attempt to use. I was offered one, but was small due the chair back and myself being a larger person. I was also offered $75 food credit at hotel restaurants only, being over Christmas period, all restaurants had special over priced dinners, including the buffet. Needless to say, I was not a happy camper. The hotel was nice as well as the property. This casino is more for the locals as it is way out in North LV. Taxi ride is about $35 plus tip and fee if you use a credit card. There is a city bus that stops in front of the hotel and takes you to Fremont Street. Overall, nice hotel, not a great location. To this day, no response from Hotel Management.
Room Tip: Tip 1 Not all staff members are friendly. Explore Hotel/Casino on you own. I asked a Rewards Host on...
See more room tips</p><br>Great emergency stay when the air went out<p>The value of this hotel is excelent. We had to stay because the air in the house went out. They were very welcoming to us. The rooms were very nice and spacious. It's a bit of a hassle to get to the pool, but it was very nice on an extremely hot day. If we have another type of emergency with our house this is where we will defiantly go.</p><br>Nice - clean - functional<p>At the recommendation of family members who have lived in Las Vegas I stayed at the hotel with family. It is about 30 minutes north of the strip and seems to be focuses on those who want to come in from the north to gamble without the hassle and extra cost of being in the heart of the city. Nothing for shows at the hotel so keep that in mind. A few restuarant options including a popular buffet that was for only about $5 with their plan. We got down there midmorning on a Saturday so did not want to wait in their line. Place also has a typical Starbucks and a gift shop that is nothing special. Looks like there is more than adequate parking.

Always tough for me to get use to all of the smoke of casinos in Vegas and this place is no exception even though they have a couple small sections for no smoking out on the casino floor.

The room cleaning crew were among the most friendly I have enountered.
Room Tip: They have no smoking floors - example we stayed on the 4th floor which is a no smoking floor and our...
