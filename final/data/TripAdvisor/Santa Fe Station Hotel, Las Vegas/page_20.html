<html><head><h3>Santa Fe Station Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 20</h3></head><body><br>IStupidity<p>I made a reservation at 5:00 PM. when I arrived at the hotel trailing a boat, I was told there was no oversized parking and that I would have to park my $200,000 boat on the street. so I called to cancel my reservation. I was told I still had to pay for the room even though I could not park there. Finally, someone cleared up the problem but i will never stay at a Statiion Hotel again.</p><br>Comfortable and a good value<p>We stayed at the Santa Fe Station because it was located near someone we were visiting. It was our first time off of the Strip and we weren't sure what to expect.

The people at the front desk were friendly and helpful. The room was large and clean. Our particular room didn't have a view, but we didn't plan on spending that much time in the room, so we didn't ask for another (save it for the people who cared). Service in the Grand Cafe (their 24-hour restaurant) was friendly and efficient. The prices were quite reasonable for generous portions of very good food.

Maid service was fast and efficient. We made sure to leave the "Please make up this room" sign when leaving so that they would know we were out. Even when we came back after a fairly short time, the room was already finished.

There is no buffet at Santa Fe, but since we rented a car, we were able to go a short distance down the road to the Texas Station (a sister property) for a fantastic buffet at an excellent price (I believe it was 5.99 for lunch and 8.99 for dinner) -- lots of selections of food from around the world, BBQ, salads, etc. But I digress...

Our first night there, we played some fun slot machines and between my husband and myself, we won about $500. That NEVER happened to us when we stayed at various places on The Strip (e.g., Caesars, Luxor, Monte Carlo). Not to say that we never won in those places, but never so much.

All in all, we didn't miss the big hotel/casinos on The Strip (we did take a ride over to see the new Wynn Las Vegas -- it's beautiful, but I know it's out of my price range). If there had been a storm that prevented us from leaving the Santa Fe, we would not have minded. It was, for us, a great place to stay.</p><br>Better Than Expected<p>My husband spent 3 weeks in Las Vegas on a business trip and was put up at the Santa Fe Station. I spent 3 days with him in a one-king bed room on the 5th floor. I saw nothing wrong with the room. I'd rank it better than a Days Inn room but not as nice as The Orleans. The quilt and other parts of the room seemed new or almost new. Housekeeping fixed the room up well each day. The pool was small and only goes 5 feet deep, but it was fine for me for hanging out in or lounging by. There was also a separate whirlpool. I ate at the coffee shop twice and Cabo's Mexican once -- both were good. The on-site Starbucks gives you a discount if you tell them your room number. The casino has many machines -- a lot of Video Poker. They almost always had a $3 Craps table with 10 times odds running, which my hubby played a lot and he did well. I didn't have as much luck on the machines. I played Keno for the first time and lost. The cocktail waitresses wore skimpy outfits that looked like a one-piece swimsuit -- like the Orleans' cocktail waitresses but with more coverage on the rear. Most of the employees were nice, minus one Bingo employee. I played two sessions in their Bingo parlor; you get 2 free drinks per person per hour-long session, and 2 free donuts per person at the 9 am session. We had a great time at Cosmic Bowling at their bowling alley. Their movie theater is still under construction, supposedly to open sometime summer 2005. That is the only thing that was under contruction while I was there -- everything else was open and running regularly. We rented an in-room movie one night; they've got "still in theaters" mainstream movies and also X-ratred stuff. The biggest problem with SFS would be its location. It is far removed from the Strip/other casinos. Also, at 28, I'm a little young for SFS. Its crowd was mostly of the grey-haired variety. It isn't a high-energy place; very laid back, which can be a plus or minus depending on what you are looking for. Since my husband was working while I was there, I spent a lot of time on my own, and at some other casinos in the past, I've felt uncomfortable, but at SFS I always felt safe. Note: A bunch of people seemed to be looking for the SFS ice skating rink. SFS no longer has ice skating; the rink has moved to Fiesta Rancho. I would give SFS 3.5 stars out of 5.</p><br>Think twice about staying here<p>This hotel is remodeling but doesn't tell you about it. There was no restaurant serving breakfast except a Starbuck's for coffee. The pool area was closed. In addition, the pool is dinky & a long walk around the entire hotel to reach it; a long walk for anyone who may be handicapped or doesn't walk well. Check-in desk in out of the way corner & a long walk from the elevators, which are quite slow. Would not willingly return.</p><br>Caution - Before you stay take out life insurance!<p>The hotel caught on fire! There was an electrical fire (third in one week) at 4:45am in the morning. What amazed me is that before the fire department could inspect the building the hotel staff told us it was safe to re-enter, and they allowed people to use the elevators! Then when the alarm would not reset - they decided to look more carefully and found the fire. They then evacuated only the second floor! They used chairs to keep fire doors open. After over an hour of standing outside they finally brought people coffee and then we begged for water for the kids - no blankets or chairs or anything else.The food court is nice, but stay out of the restaurants or you will get sick - uncooked chicken and dried out old steaks.Mostly poker machines and a terrible smoke problem. Was never really busy, even with locals.Room rate quoted was $55 but then when you arrive they add $4.50 for air conditioning and $1. for phones (even if you have them turned off).This place is horrible - there is much better elsewhere in Vegas.</p><br>Sans autre intérêt !<p>Nous y sommes arrêtés pour y passer une nuit seulement (un samedi soir), car l’hôtel était sur notre chemin…. Une seule chambre dispo, et fumeur en plus à 190$. Accompagnés de notre fille, détestant l’odeur de la cigarette, et d’autant plus que nous savions les prix pratiqué par l’hôtel hors week-end (env. 80$), nous nous attendions un petit geste de la part du réceptionniste, qui a refusé sèchement ! Bref, La chambre était correcte, propre, bien insonorisé, et la literie plutôt agréable mais sentait très fort. A l’arrivé dans la chambre, il y avait des linges de bain que pour une seule personne. Nous avons dû appeler la réception pour qu’ils fassent le nécessaire. La salle de bain était petite et pas rénové du tout ! L’hôtel qui a une taille relativement importante, possède une petite piscine, et notre chambre donnait directement sur la piscine. Bref, au prix que nous avons payé… c’est un peu l’arnaque.
Room Tip: la chambre 249 donne sur la piscine, et est au bout du couloir... donc plutôt calme.

Pour 56 dollars la nuit le casino est immense et propose pleins de services donc rapport qualité prix très très bien !! Certes le casino est fumeur ! Comme tous maintenant a vegas ,je recommande !!!</p><br>no vale la pena<p>realmente no lo recomiendo, en las vegas hay mucho mejores hoteles x el mismo valor o aun menos, ademas apesar de ser un hotel alejado del strip (si o si se debe contar con auto) cobran resort fee de U$S 15.</p><br>Cobra un costo adicional por servicio de cuarto<p>Estuve alojado 7 dias en este hotel, que cumple ampliamente con un servicio 3 estrellas.
La atención fue muy buena.
El único tema a criticar que al finalizar mi estadía me cobraron u$s14,55 por noche en concepto de "Service room fee", lo cual me resultó poco serio teniendo en cuenta que ese ítem tiene que estar incluido en la tarifa de alojamiento. No debería ser un ítem adicional y no lo informan al momento de contratar la estadía ni al momento del check in.
Es como tomar un avion y que al finalizar el viaje cobren un servicio de azafata. Totalmente ridículo.</p><br>Première étape de notre us trip<p>Début en beauté. Un hôtel dans un casino avec toutes les commodités à disposition. Une chambre très confortable, juste dommage Que soit a l'opposé de l'ascenseur donc faut traverser tout le couloir. Le wifi est payant !!!! (5 $ env. Par jour).
Au petit matin vous trouverez le journal accroché à la porte et vous aurez droit à un petit déjeuner buffet gargantuesque digne des breakfast ricains ! Œuf, omelettes fraîche, tex mex, pattes, toutes sortes de céréales, salades, bacon, gâteaux, yaourt, fromage, et bien sur pain beurre et confiture... Boissons chaudes et froides... Et le tout a volonté... Et tout ça pour 5,99$ !!!!
Donc pour bien commencer la journée et passer une journée de folie à Vegas je vous conseille de faire le plein en énergie et même de charger votre sac a dos... Vraiment nous avons été ravis de notre séjour au santa fe et on y retournera c'est sur !</p><br></body></html>
