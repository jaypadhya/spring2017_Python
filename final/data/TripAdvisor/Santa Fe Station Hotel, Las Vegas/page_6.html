<html><head><h3>Santa Fe Station Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 6</h3></head><body><br>Not bad for the price<p>Ok so the reason location got high markings is due to it being right off th e freeway and convenient for visiting family if you are local. The hotel itself the rooms ore nice sized. The hallway to the room was filthy food all over looked like no one had vacuumed or cleaned in sometime. I stayed 3 days and housekeeping never came to my room not once. I had to call for towels. The casino is not bad there are a good amount of food choices. Buffet is not good but the steak house is amazing however alacart and pricy.</p><br>A little smelly, a little cramped, a little worn – but not awful<p>There is nothing significantly wrong with the casino at Santa Fe Station. While it is decidedly geared toward locals, that in no way interferes with anyone else's enjoyment. The casino is clean and has a secure feel. The casino's main drawback is that someone plays tape loops about the casino's promotions both too loudly and too frequently, which borders on infuriating.
The hotel, on the other hand, boasts tired rooms and noticeably smelly hallways (I was never on a smoking floor – I don't want to know what those are like). Of particular note are the laughably (unless you must actually use them – then, it's not so funny) small, cramped bathrooms. They're embarrassingly small and tight. I actually took a picture of the ridiculous lumpiness of my bed because it was too funny not to!
I've read that some of the rooms have been remodeled, but I've yet to be assigned one in several stays at Santa Fe. No bugs. Reasonable room cleanliness. No grossness issues.
Bottom line: Fancy it ain't. Glamorous, it ain't.
But you could do worse, and the hotel did not seem to present any overt health hazard. I suspect that most bacteria succumb to death from old age on the interminably slow elevators (count 'em! 2!).
Room Tip: If there are any exceptional views from the rooms, I've not encountered them. The pool is truly...

In my case, they don't really love me and I don't help them make a lot of money since I had the privilege of staying here.
If you have asthma, stay away. The minute you enter the casino, smoke is everywhere. Even your "no smoking" room smells like smoke. The bathroom has mold and the air conditioning filters are filthy. I couldn't understand why I had such bad allergies until I looked up and saw that the filters haven't been replaced in a long time.

The carpet outside and in the rooms look like they were recycled from another hotel. The food selection including the feast buffet is mediocre. The convenience of Starbucks is great. The gift shop isn't worth a visit. But all of the staff members I have met are terrific. Even though this place looks like it's been here for decades, the staff members are really friendly. My biggest gripe besides the dirty filters and the mold in the bathrooms is the operator. I have to call a central call center in order to reach the front desk.
If you're looking for a cheap Vegas experience, this is it. Just remember it's far away from the strip and the airport. What you save on staying here will cost you in the end.</p><br>Perfect for me<p>I wanted a clean room, away from the LV craziness. The room was nice, big, and clean.

The casino was a perfect size and felt relaxed.

Dinner was great. Ate at the bar of their steakhouse, Charcoal Room. Bartender, Ruth, was friendly and attentive.

The Revolver bar was a blast. It's a country bar and it was FULL of line dancers. A lot of people seemed to know each other (locals) and were friendly and welcoming to an outsider.

The staff kept mentioning the Station property at Red Rocks as being very nice, so I'm guessing that's their flagship location.</p><br>A solid two, but I'll give it three<p>This is not The Palazzo, Caesars Palace, The Bellagio, or The Venetian. So get those wild vegas suite dreams out of your head.

I had the unfortunate experience of staying at the Sante Fe Station over the past week. And it was not because the rooms or facilities.

If you're coming in from out of state to see Las Vegas and the Strip, and happen to be enticed by the cheap price, think again. This hotel is right on the highway, but approximately 15minutes, by driving yourself, to downtown. There is no adequate public transport to the strip, a rental car is absolutely necessary. You can take a bus, for a trip of over an hour one way. Or a taxi, for $60-$70 one way. This is not a hotel to stay at if you want the true vegas experience. There are many cheap hotels on the strip, more so north strip.

The facilities at the hotel are more than sufficient if you're in the mood to gamble. Plenty of tables, and thousands of slots. Clientele seems to be of the early bird special variety. Ventilation seems poor, the hotel does smell like smoke everywhere(but not too overwhelming). There is also a movie theatre and bowling alley, neither of which I patronized.

The pool is pathetic. You have to walk around two buildings and through a parking lot to find it. It's literally an afterthought built onto the back of a building!

There are plenty if food options to cover most appetites. I would strongly advise to stay clear of the "feast buffet". It's around $12, but the quality is atrocious. I found my self, when stuck on site, eating at the restaurants that are set up like a mall food court. Wingstop is great(ask for crispy fries if you don't like them soggy). There is also a Starbucks, pizza place, and a couple others. The casino also included a couple sitdown inside style restaurants, the cafe and the Mexican place. I did enjoy the breakfast at the cafe(not sure what it's called, next to the buffet).

The rooms that a stayed in, both a king room and a double queen, were adequate for the price. There are the errant carpet stains(in both the hallways and rooms), but for a room that can be had for $17 a night, can you really expect more? I've stayed in worse hotels for $120/night. This place is a bargain(if you know what you're in for!). The beds are decent, and serve their purpose. The pillows are cheap and unrelenting. I could probably do better by stuffing my dirty laundry into a trash bag. All the sheets were clean and pressed. The rooms were cleanly overall, but seem a little stressed. Furniture is updated and in good condition.

The random charges of $15 people are getting hit with is most likely the package that is offered at check in. It includes internet, a paper everyday, and maybe something else. I believe you can refuse this option up front. Read the fine print on the papers you are signing!

The free internet is 1mbs.

Rooms on the third floor may give you a nice view of the opposing three story parking garage. The fourth is ok, and the fifth provides great views of the surround mountains and the vegas strip skyline(granted pretty far away).

It's not as bad as some of these reviews make it out to be. Don't expect a 5 star resort(or a 3-4 for that matter), and you might come out pleasantly surprised.</p><br>Inconsistent as Usual<p>The Fertitta Brothers (owners) strike again!. I have their Casino Card so I stay at one or more of their 11 locations for Station Casinos in the Las Vegas area several times a year. This "chain" is so inconsistent. The last time I stayed at Santa Fe Station the room 14 months ago was awful; something that had not been remodeled since the Hotel was built; and it literally stank. This time the room was excellent, nothing was wrong at all and the room was modern and complete in all aspects. So why did I rate them average? I don't trust them to be consistent in the type of rooms or cleanliness or service or fees. So two beds were $45 with tax and resort fee which isn't bad. This is NOT a resort hotel. There is a small pool out by the back service entrance with views of four stucco walls. The staff of very helpful. The buffett was pretty good, in fact I liked everything I picked. Big down side for me: There wasn't anywhere I went for food or in the hotel (not the room) or the casino that did not smell like cigarette smoke. I had to take an asthma pill to have dinner. In could have been the strong winds from a thunderstorm that was occuring (blowing the exhaust air backwards in the ducts), or just that their HVAC system does not work correctly ever. They need to clean the carpets in the hotel hallways.
Room Tip: I don't know if they have remodeled all their rooms or not, so you might get a bad room or good...
See more room tips</p><br>Nice hotel<p>This hotel has big rooms, but very small bathrooms. You have a hard time even reaching the toilet paper--it is behind your arm. You need to be a contortionist for this. I would think they could take just one foot from the bedroom to enlarge the bathroom. There is a lot of empty space in the bedroom. In the king size room you could probably fit about 4-5 people on the floor in sleeping bags, if needed. Other than a large room, there is nothing special about this hotel. It is very noisy, people walking down the halls talking can be heard inside the rooms.</p><br>Dirty Room<p>The room was very dirty, stained carpet and bed shirting. There was mold in the bathroom. Reported this to housekeeping and she took report and stated it would be reported to front desk. There was no adjustment made to our bill for this state of unclean room. I would recommend never to stay at this facility.
Room Tip: Pick a different hotel.
See more room tips</p><br>Stay-cation at Santa Fe Station<p>Summer is a great time for locals to check out the attractions. Rates (for everyone) are very low and there are lots of specials (for locals especially). With a few exceptions (Red Rock, Green Valley), the Station casino chain makes little pretense of being a class act.
The room was large and clean, though shopworn. The hallway carpet desperately needs cleaning. Bathroom=tiny but lots of towels and sufficient amenities, with a good shower. A/C=very good, easy to adjust, and quickly responsive. Check-in and out: quite amazingly, once one found the Registration Desk, there was no line. Staff were friendly and helpful.

There's a Cineplex, a bowling alley, pool, a kid center (with kid sitting provided, not that it applied to us), food court, various restaurants and nightclubs. Good place for a stay-cation. Cost for the hotel was just about $50 (not including meals and movie, of course).
We'd been sent lots of meal incentives so we went for lunch, took in a movie, skipped the free bowling, booked a nice dinner (separately reviewed), and had a very enjoyable stay.
Room Tip: The higher numbers are at the end of a loooooong corridor. Ask for a lower numbered room.
See more room tips</p><br>Had a nice stay considering...<p>Stayed at this hotel while in LV for a funeral. It was priced right and away from all the craziness of "The Strip." The room was fine, but the bathroom was very small. Has a movie theater, bowling alley, and arcade which is nice if you are traveling with kids. They seem to cater more to locals, but we enjoyed our stay as much as possible considering what we were in town for. Staff was very friendly and accommodating. Perfect if you're traveling with kids.</p><br></body></html>
