<html><head><h3>Santa Fe Station Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 3</h3></head><body><br>Far from the Strip<p>If you want to stay out of the strip, this hotel is the best choice. It has quite a number of restaurants, has movie theater, bowling lanes, lots of lots of slot machines and a big space for table games. We rented 1Queen bed, Non-smoking. The room is just plain. We stayed there last April and in the middle of the night the emergency alarm went off and everyone panicked. I called the front desk to inquire what happened while the alarm was still on but they did not answer the call. The guard showed up and told everyone to go back to our respective rooms, did not even bother to apologize. I thought it was rude.</p><br>Bring your earplugs!<p>This is far from the strip. The good things about this hotel: decent food and airy casino for those that don't smoke! Suggest that you bring earplugs though - we could hear the whole conversation of the people next door - and they weren't yelling. Rest of the room was decent. Mostly firm beds. Lots of places to choose to eat. We were given lots of coupons upon check-in - from a free game of bowling (yes, there is a working bowling alley) to free upgraded bingo games, a free drink, etc. So, I rated very good for the money.</p><br>Here for training class<p>Decent hotel , slow elevators. Wouldn't be my first choice and its a good distant from the strip. Decent choice of places to eat. Most employees were nice. Rooms need updating and refreshing but I guess it is what it is</p><br>Great hotel but food not impressive<p>We read many good reviews and found a great price for Memorial Day weekend. The hotel is miles from the strip but all self contained. The casino was the type where you feel like you have a chance to win which is rare in Vegas. My uncle went with me and won a few hundred within a short time. I only lost a little.
Use valet parking or you'll be walking a lot. The room was nice with a good tv and nice shower/tub combo. Furniture was up to date and little to complain about--except for our view of the parking garage.
We ate dinner at the buffet that's a mistake. Mediocrity and a step below your local Golden Corral. Only good things were the house made ice cream and the roast beef. Salad selection was okay
We saw and heard about midnight special at the cafe. We tried and were not happy. Gravy with the small biscuit (1) was watery. The eggs were great but bacon horribly limp and greasy. Hash browns that I asked for crisp were hash whites. Even the toast was cold with just a smidgen of butter.
So stay there but try somewhere else to eat.</p><br>Coffee Shop still lackadaisical!<p>Every time I visit the Grand Caf√© the story is the same. Food takes FOREVER to come out! Servers don't care or are overwhelmed! They can't even poach eggs the right way(too soft or overcooked). If you order a steak, be prepared for an hour wait. Breakfast dishes include very GREASY hash browns. This place has never had a good manager. Even Nick, the waiter has become complacent. Do yourself a favor.........go to Mimis' down the road!
Room Tip: Get a mountain view room
See more room tips</p><br>An ok place to lay your head at night<p>Just a basic hotel room with a crappy view of the roof of the casino....it was clean, bed was hard and your everyday basic casino for locals. Tried the buffet, was ok. Took for ever to get a drink while playing $1 slot machines</p><br>Past Favorite - Now May Have to Reconsider My Hotel Choice<p>My husband and I have been staying at this hotel 2 or 3 times a year for the past several years. We just got home from a 3-day trip and this time we were a little disappointed. The hotel is remodeling the rooms on the 2nd floor (which is good) so we were placed in a room on the 4th floor. King rooms are located quite a distance from the elevator and ice machine so make sure you wear comfortable shoes since it is quite a walk. For the first time ever, we found cockroaches in the bathroom. We notified the front desk, however, the staff member appeared to not be concerned and did not offer to discount the room. We normally have a great time here, this did not ruin the trip but it was a little alarming and based on the staff member's lack of concern, we will probably reconsider our hotel choice during our future trips to Las Vegas. With the exception of the one unconcerned staff member at the front desk, Casino staff are very pleasant.
Room Tip: Get a room facing the parking garage if you are staying on weeknights. The noise from delivery truc...
See more room tips</p><br>Great Room Great Price<p>Our room was right off the elevator. My first impulse was to demand a room change. However, being one who will always give a chance, we checked into the room. The room was clean and quiet. We never heard a thing all night. Nice view too. The gaming rooms were a little smoky but there is a non smoking area.</p><br>A Step Back in Time<p>My wife and I stayed at a La Quinta near the Strip for 3 nights for a family function/visit. Very nice. We stayed here 2 nights because it was close to my brother's whom we were also visiting. This was the Vegas I remember when my parents would bring me as a kid and when I was older. I agree it's dated like the other reviews state. Our room had few amenities. We stayed in an ADA room and there was no place to put soap and shampoo or hang a wash cloth in the shower or to hang a robe or whatever on the door. The room was huge, but no fridge or microwave. Just a TV in an otherwise empty armoire. The room was clean which matters to us the most. But we're not to fussy and for the off week price (Mon & Tue) we paid it was a bargain compared to the Strip/near Strip prices. I would have been upset if we'd paid the weekend rates tho'. We didn't care for all the people, traffic, noise and high prices for food etc. around the Strip. That's where this hotel/casino shines! It has some chain fast food places that were reasonable along with nice restaurants. The Cafe had a great breakfast for $3.99. Dinner's were OK there also. Didn't check the buffet. $.99 Margaritas which were pretty tasty, but I doubt you could get much of a buzz off of 3 of them.... It was relatively quiet and laid back. We don't gamble but there's all the stuff the Strip casino's have. If you're on a budget and just want a decent place to play/eat without all the glitz... this is for you.</p><br>Government WMD Class<p>Here for a Government paid class WMD Nuc/Rad. Not a hotel I would have chosen. Dated rooms with a broken armoire. Found finger nail clippings behind bedside table when I went to plug in my phone to charge. 5 Watt LED bulbs x3 in a hanging lamp! No refrigerator or microwave in room. Lots of locals in the casino. Far from the downtown and strip area.
Room Tip: Choose a different hotel!
