<html><head><h3>Santa Fe Station Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 7</h3></head><body><br>Definitely changed from two years ago<p>We stayed here two nights recently and the rates were very reasonable. But we also stayed here about two years ago and it seemed much nicer then and the people seemed nicer. One thing to note is they charge you a resort fee for services on top of room rate and taxes. I asked what this was for and they said pool and Internet. Well our internet and TV didn't work the two days we were there, they said it was being upgraded. They didn't even offer a partial refund because they said I was getting "so much more". I didn't want more, I wanted Internet. I had to upgrade my phone data plan to cover my time. Recommend asking if is repaired if it is important to you.

The rooms were good sized and we had a nice view of the mountains, which almost anywhere in Las Vegas does. The location is not for people wanting the strip action, this is far removed. We stayed here to be close to friends.

One other crazy thing I noticed. If someone stays in a room with a family of 4 and two queen beds, how many towels would you need? 4 right? We had only two and asked for more. They did bring them but the next day the cleaned and only left two again. I don't like calling for towels every day.

Overall a very average hotel and if it had been any more expensive I probably would have went elsewhere.</p><br>Be careful!<p>They said the rooms were renovated, I could see none. When asking at the front desk they said there were flat screen TV's and "he thought" carpeting. They must have missed our room for the carpeting. There were big black blotches on the carpet all over our room - and sticky spots right by the bed. When we checked in there was a long black hair hanging off the hairdryer in the room. Black hair in the sink. Black mascara on the mirror in the bedroom section. Heavy layer of dust on hairdryer cord. Dirt all over the wall paper in bath. Our phone in the room wasn't working, we couldn't turn the light out over the table to go to bed. Engineering came up and fixed phone - it was plugged in the wrong place. ( We didn't do it) The light over the table was a pull cord, they fiddled around and fixed it temporarily and said they would come back the next day to replace it. They never did. So the following nights we simply unscrewed the light bulbs to turn off the lights. The only redeeming factor was that this hotel was close to family that we had in the area. It was a nightmare</p><br>Far from Strip<p>Stayed here for 3 nights. Big hotel with bowling alley, movie theatre and restaurants. "Station" theme. Rooms were ok. Bed very comfortable; pillows awful and bathroom super small. Ok for 2 people but no more than that. We were on a "smoke free" floor but the smell of smoke was in everything...carpet, walls, curtains, etc...I bought Febreze and sprayed the entire room down. It's a good 20 minutes from the strip too, which wasn't a big problem for us. Reasonably priced though, around $80.00 per night. Ate at one of the restaurants (mexican) and it was good. Lots of casino atmosphere.</p><br>Mystery Shopper<p>It all depends on your pace. If your in your 20's to early 30s, downtown offers loud music, pool parties but everything is overpriced and crowded. Middle aged with wife and kids, then a balance of bolwing, movies, pool is fun for the kids, everything is half priced Sunday night to Thursday night to include rooms and buffet. Lets the kids have fun while you keep an eye on them during the day, if the kids are too young to stay alone, check them in into the casino day care for about $7.00 per hour (weekends is about $9 per hour). Like anything else, pace yourself with your budget (on a 3 day visit, spend 33% per day). Don't blow your entire budget in one day and make the kids suffers. Be realistic, whatever your game is, if you can double your 20, it's a good day. Bottom line, HAVE FUN with the family and PACE yourself and that includes drinking, hyrdrate with water during the day and reward yourslef with some drinks in the evening. Belive me, I have learned the hard way and have blown the vacation. Take care and HAVE FUN.</p><br>They only like locals<p>Me and my buddies played craps the dealers were very apathetic towards us. One of the dealers had his buddy playing and kept giving us a hard time for not tipping and we only had been playing for ten minutes and were not winning. I would have chalked this up to the guy being unfriendly buy the dealer and this guy were whispering to each other and smirking. So I came to the conclusion that were out of towners and they were going to continue giving us a hard time. Before all this happened I signed up for there player card and the table boss said I could use the coupon for craps so I played it and the dealers gave me a hard time about using saying it could only be used for blackjack. Had one dealer throwing it across the table and told the one to read it for him self. They embarrassed me and my buddies. So I gave up on craps since they were being jerks. I went to use my coupon on blackjack and the dealer said that it was for roulette so threw it down and walked away because no one there had a clue and they were all jerks. Nothing about this casino is good. It is days away from anything important in Las Vegas. Do not waste your time if you have an out of state ID they will treat you like a second class citizen. There motto is we love locals, that is all they love they could care less about tourists.</p><br>Don't stay here<p>Based on location I made a reservation over 60 days in advance asking or a King bed non smoking. I called to confirm the request 24 hours before arrival. Once we got there it was either a room with two smaller beds or smoking. I know requests are not guaranteed but it was clear that they make no attempt whatsoever to accommodate requests. Had we arrived at 9 or 10 pm it would have been different but at 4 pm I am convinced that they just stick people here they want and don't even look at requests . Save yourself the aggravation and stay elsewhere
Room Tip: Not sure there are any good rooms
See more room tips</p><br>Stay-cation in Las Vegas<p>We decided we needed a couple of nights away from the house to rest and sit by a pool. Santa Fe offered us two free nights and we took them up on the offer. The room was big, clean and dark and quiet. We got two great nights sleep. The pool was cold but the weather was hot so we had a great day sitting by the pool and jumping in and out of the water once in a while to cool off. The buffet was clean and plentiful with a wide selection of food. we managed to double our gambling allotment so that was an added benefit. If you are visiting Las Vegas and want an inexpensive place to stay away from the "Strip" The Santa Fe Station is the place to stay.
Room Tip: Don't pay extra for the "pool view". You can see the mountains from all the rooms.

The buffet - service and food was the worst I have ever seen and very overpriced for the poor quality food and service. No standardized procedures for how things are done - different rules regarding bell cart usage each day we were there. Guest service is not an important option as the front desk clerk who checked us out didn't even ask how our stay was. The only really bright spot was our server in the Caf√© our last night - he was friendly and helpful and kept our glasses filled. This was supposed to be a three star establishment but we found it very lacking.</p><br>Stay Away From Coffee Shop<p>The Grand Cafe is poorly managed. I've spoken to the manager several times but she doesn't seem to get it. Servers are cranky. Charles looks like he wants to punch somebody! Cooks appear to have zero training. It is virtually IMPOSSIBLE to have a meal without some sort of screw-up. Employees feel a sense of entitlement. If you go here, tip big and don't complain about anything or they will run you out of town!</p><br>God Experience I can back again<p>This Hotel is located in Summerlin about 25 min from the strip, the casino is big have cinema and bowling, is a local casino and you can find a lot of local vegas people, the price is average and you can use this only for sleep, however we made the reservation thru Expedia and I found an excellent deal for just 20 dlls per night, the check in was quick the lady in the front desk was not very friendly but wasn't rude so I think is ok.
The rooms are clean and the beds very comfortable, not a lot of noise so the sleep quality is great, they give us a coupon for a free Starbucks down stairs.
We try the buffet and was very good, and cheap please do not go to the Grand Cafe located near to the buffet because the service is to slow and the food not very well.

No complains at all so I thing I might come back again.
Room Tip: Made a reservation by expendia they have great deals sometimes
