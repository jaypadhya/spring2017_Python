<html><head><h3>Santa Fe Station Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 15</h3></head><body><br>Not much of a room<p>First stay at Sante Fe. Room was pretty bland, sort of like a Day's Inn. Got a great last minute deal. Hotel was pretty worn, and lobby is tucked away in a wing of the casino, not very attractive. Desk clerk was very helpful in correcting a botched reservation, and saved us night's room cost.

Santa Fe is far off the strip, we stayed because we were visiting relatives nearby. I would not stay there again unless it was unavoidable. Too many better choices in Vegas.
Room Tip: Try a different casino, like M Resort, or Red Rock or Aliante, if you want to be off the strip.

I should have bought a blanket and slept in my rental car, it was truly that bad. What's tough is that there was no one thing that was outright awful but all the little things added up to a bad experience.

1) The sheets on the bed were about as soft as a burlap sack
2) No humidification system in the hotel and incredibly dry air made for static everywhere. We moved down to the strip the last night and there was none of that at the Monte Carlo (which was not much more than SFS by the way!)
3) Old school 27" non HD TV. I get it, they want you out of the room. Even Hampton Inns have HDTVs in the room and for NFL playoff weekend I was disappointed.
4) Terrible smoke ventilation. You can walk through Caesar's and barely detect the smoke. This was stick-to-your-clothes-the-minute-you-walk-in bad.
5) Impolite staff. Upon checking in there was a problem with our reservation and the front desk person said, "Well SOMEONE is going to pay for this!" It turned out it was their error.
6) Terrible operational efficiency. One check in person for the entire hotel? Two elevators for an entire tower? (Oh, and the elevators were not in great shape, were slow, and worn down.) Even the food court places opened late, didn't have all the ingredients for basic items, and weren't polite about things.

I know this isn't the Bellagio, but if you have staff hired and trained, why not train them right? The fact that they misfired on every single detail made it such that I will not stay at a station hotel (excluding Red Rock, which was very nice) again.</p><br>Get what you pay for<p>I read the reviews for this hotel was was dreading my visit....I was pleasantly surprised! Check in was a snap and the lobby/casino were attractive. Our room was dark but clean with a comfortable bed. The view of the mountains was a treat too. Honestly, I've paid a lot more to stay in much worse places right off the PA Turnpike.</p><br>Convenient, clean, comfortable<p>The room was $35 plus $15 resort fee, so for $50 this was way better than any motel 6. Located right off the highway at the very north end of Vegas, it was the perfect stop for a drive from Arizona to Oregon. Didn't know what to expect for the price, but was very surprised. Bed was extra comfortable, room was clean and property overall was nice. Would definitely stay here over a Holiday Inn Express or other chain next time through.</p><br>Would not return!<p>When we arrived at our hotel at 11:00 p.m., front staff could not find our reservation! After showing them our confirmation, the unfriendly staff still didn't know what to do. 20 minutes later, we finally got a room. Tiny bathrooms with toilets that don't flush. Very smoky, very unimpressed! Would not return!</p><br>YUCK!<p>I cannot believe their are reviews on here that say their room was clean! The carpet in our room was absolutely disgusting! There were nasty stains everywhere! After one night we checked out, but the front desk insisted on charging us for the entire stay. We spoke with a manager and explained that we did not want to stay because the room was dirty and below our expectation. The manager said he would see what he could do and he would get back to us, but he never did. DO NOT RECOMMEND!</p><br>A Fairly Nice Surprise<p>I checked in here while moving some items out of a house to rent it. After two 10-hour days of moving furniture, I went to the Santa Fe to attempt to locate a room. There were some rooms, but being Labor Day Weekend, they wanted a premium price. Carla at the front desk work with us to get the Military Discount and one other to get our 2 nights down to an average of $90. In the area for that weekend, it was a good price.

The rooms here are still fairly new, so the furniture is nice and beds are comfortable. Views are ok, especially if you are facing the strip. The back has some pretty good views of the air conditioning units... Property has a bowling alley, theater, showroom, nightclub, and bar. It also has the typical casino restaurants to include the buffet and signature steak house.

We had to ask for some extra towels, because there were only two bath towels. No problem getting them put in the room when the maid made up our beds. Overall, it was a pretty good stay. The walls are typical, and the noise is rediculous. The kids down the hall were noisy until 3 a.m. I am still wondering who brings young kids to Vegas for vacation...</p><br>Comfortable Hotel--Way Off The Strip<p>Okay, here's the scoop: We're Vegas "locals"...and we frequent this place--for occasional gaming & a quick bite to eat...since it's in the neighborhood.

Well, the husband won a "free night" during some kiosk spin promotion the hotel was having a while back, so we booked a room.

Ten years ago, we stayed here for a week (during our first week living in Vegas--since the nuts we were buying our house from refused to get out until we were officially in town).

Ten years later--the Santa Fe seems fine. They put us in a nice room that was quite spacious. No real WOW! factor (like the Palazzo or Venetian suites), but still above average on all accounts--considering it was a freebee.

The Good: Roomy, comfy king bed, spotlessly clean room, good toiletries (splendid orange scented soap), free WI-FI, nice view of the pool (we didn't use it, but people looked like they were having fun in the pool & hot tub), wide variety of restaurants & other stuff to do (bowling/movies), pleasant staff at the desk & phone.

The Not So Good: Although they waived the "resort fee"--since we had a comped room--I still think the whole resort fee scheme sucks! $15 bucks for a cup of coffee, faxing, the small gym...In my opinion, these amenities should be part of the package.

So, although the Santa Fe doesn't have the Wow! factor that can be fun treat on The Strip, it's still a good value & an above average experience.</p><br>Santa Fe Station provides great customer service<p>The room was clean, room looked exactly like the picture on the website, and there was a pool, hot tub, iron, hair dryer, movie theater, and bowling alley. My brother-in-law was meeting us in Vegas and arrived one day early and didn’t have a hotel reservation, but the staff let us have a rollaway bed at no additional charge (they also laughed with me about his stupidity..well that was my comment not theirs). The buffet was inexpensive and good food selections, and there is a discount for using the players cards. I woke early the next morning so had coffee in the café which was a pleasant experience since it is lonely sometimes sitting by myself in a restaurant. The staff was attentive and pleasant to chat with and kept my coffee cup filled. I asked for directions to Aliante Station knowing it was also way north of the strip, and one of the employees who lives in that area gave me exact and precise directions! Of course, the only negative is that the property is quite far from the strip. We had a rental car and knew ahead of time it was a drive, but it was reasonable and served our purpose since it was a Saturday night stay and much less expensive than a strip location hotel.</p><br>THE WORST VEGAS CASINO I HAVE EVER STAYED AT<p>Let me start with the good part...it was cheap. Now for the bad. First, the rooms all smell like smoke, even the non smoking rooms. The staff is either rude or doesn't care (I'll get to that in a minute). Every night there seemed to be loud, rowdy, men who were dressed like they just came out of a gangster rap video, all over the casino property. We complained to the hotel security about this and were given the brush off. One night there was a bar fight at "4949", the casino bar, in which glasses and bottles were used as weapons and I found myself caught in the middle of it. Once again, hotel security was totally worthless. Security, which this time was led by an obese Hispanic man, told us that there was nothing they could do and we should go back to our rooms. Well, we did and we won't ever be going back. My advice is to spend a couple more dollars and stay closer to the strip and get real customer service!</p><br></body></html>
