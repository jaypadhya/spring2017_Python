<html><head><h3>Santa Fe Station Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 5</h3></head><body><br>Not As Bad As I Expected<p>Stayed here for 3 nights with my 15 year old daughter. The hotel is quite far out of Vegas - about $40 in a cab to the strip and $50 to the airport.
Our room was basic but clean. Maybes a bit dated but not as bad as some reviews have said. You can smell smoke even in the no smoking rooms and although this wasn't a problem for us I can understand how it would be for some people, Food is readily available and even through the night in the cafe. I think most of the casino customers are locals but as we didn't use the casino this wasn't a problem.
The reception staff were helpful as in ringing cabs for us but one bit of advice to them - SMILE!!
If you are elderly and struggle with your luggage you don't get any help.
So it wasn't a bad experience but only for a short stay.</p><br>Worst stay in awhile<p>I would only suggest staying here if you dont mind emphazema or black lung. My "non smoking" room was so smoke filled, I slept the "elf approved - full 20 minutes"! I've stayed in nicer Motel 6. The closet is a rod with 4 non removable hangars. The bathroom is the smallest I've ever seen. I did have the priviledge of paying $12.99 for the "resort fee", for the bowling alley, fitness closet and a cup of Starbucks, none of which I used. Probably the biggest disappointment, and totally within staff control, was how rudely I was treated at check in. I waited a few minutes at an empty desk before saying "hello ?". A girl came out, took my ccard and ID, gave me my room keys, and NEVER SPOKE. I thought I was on some hidden camera. I've never seen anything like it. It's a lot funnier this morning that it was last night. She did speak to the guest who was standing behind me. He made the mistake of asking if there were any rooms. She responded, "No. Sold Out." So, she could actually speak. I checked out after one night, and found another hotel. Wow. The so-called "local's favorite" is not anywhere on my top 10,000 list of favorite hotels. I'll never be back.</p><br>Never again!<p>Was booked at this hotel as part of a government class. It was so bad, I checked out of my free room and paid to stay elsewhere the last night. The hallways are disgustingly dirty with smells of every bodily fluid available as you walk down the halls. They have miniature toilets in the bathrooms and the sink countertop in a perfect location for you to hit your elbow on if you sit down on the toilet.

The clientele in the casino is sketchy at best, I watched a man in the middle of the casino work up a mouthful of spit and let it fly right on the casino floor.

Despite coming with a shuttle bus full of patrons there was only one person checking people in.

Wireless was at a snails speed.

Go elsewhere!
Room Tip: Try a different hotel.

First off, front desk was RUDE. There was no consistency between what was handed to you when you checked in. Some got coupons, others didn't. They enrolled me in the players club without asking me.

Even the two people at the desk were annoyed with eachother.

My group was large. 90+ people. My personal group checked in and reserved as a group of four. They put each one of us on a different floor.

The ONE elevator location has 2 elevators. You need your room key to access them. They are SLOW.

The decor is disgusting. The carpet is outdated and stained. The rooms and hallways are poorly lit.

In the room, dust on everything. The furniture was used and abused. The carpet was nasty.

The bathrooms are tiny. The shower head pulled out of the wall when I tried to adjust it.

The electrical box pulled out of the wall when I tried unplugging my phone cord.

The alarm clock was unplugged when I arrived. I set it up. The alarm never went off. Neither did some else's in my group.

Tv channels suck. Phone hand held unplugged from base in arrival.

Just an all around crappy hotel.

Oh. And it's $62.50 for a cab to the strip. Plus tip. And don't ask. There is no other way there and the front desk doesn't care about helping you get there.</p><br>Beware of the Bathroom Sink and its proximity to the Toliet<p>I stayed for 4 nights, at this hotel. The carpet is the first thing I noticed. It is dirty, stained and needs to be cleaned. The bathroom is extremely small, Beware of the corner of the sink, it is so close you can hurt yourself. The door is too close for comfort. If you are claustrophobic, you should rethink this hotel. The view from the room was the rooftop air conditioner. There is no room service. The wifi is another story. They really should reconsider those pillows on the bed that match the coverlet, They are stinky, and reek of other folks body odor. Several of the restaurants are good, but stay away from the buffet. More bad food chooses that good.</p><br>Nope, nope and nope.<p>We were booked here while in Nevada for training. Wow...dirty, stained, dimly lit, smelly, sketchy wifi at best, only 2 elevators (1 location) for all floors, ect. It's a $60 cab ride if you want to go to the strip, or well...anywhere. Their selling point is "it's where the locals come to play" and that's about it. The gaming is ok if you like poker machines I suppose..very little table play options. We had 6 players and asked the pit boss to open a blackjack table for us due to there being only a couple of tables open (but full)...no dice, no dealers, just a bunch of closed tables. Not a good experience.
Room Tip: Go elsewhere

This hotel is 20 miles from the strip with nothing to do in the area. I wouldn't stay there again if it was free. We stayed here because of the location as we have friends in the area, never again!
Room Tip: Don't stay there.
See more room tips</p><br>Probably not again....<p>We are here from Oct 1 to Oct 7...hallway carpet is dirty and stained. We asked for non smoking room however there is smoking allowed on the floor we r on and it just filters into the.room. Needless to say I was not happy. Probably would not stay in the future. Bathroom very small however it's clean
Housekeeping showed up around 2 Just when we were coming back to relax.....just sent them on their way.</p><br>Decent Hotel Away From The Strip<p>I stayed at the Santa Fe Station, for a couple of nights, recently during a business trip. The hotel seemed to be an older place. The rooms were large, but the lighting in them is dim. My bed was comfortable and I was able to sleep all night. The carpet throughout the hotel seemed old and stained. There are several restaurants and bars, with nightlife, inside the hotel that make dining convenient. I tried a few of the fast food type places and the food was acceptable. The cafe has decent prices and the food there was pretty good. The Charcoal Room Steakhouse is pricey, but the food is outstanding. The casino was not crowded at all. I left some money there. The staff was friendly and helpful. I didn't make a trip to the Strip. The taxi ride was about $70 one way. There is not much to do around this hotel that is within walking distance. Overall, I enjoyed my stay and had a good experience at the Santa Fe. I would try a different hotel on my next trip to Vegas.</p><br>NICE QUIET STAY<p>I was graciously given 3 free nights courtesy of Santa Fe. I hadn't been there for over a year and yet they were tenacious about keeping me informed regarding hotel rates by mail. I was only disappointed that for some reason I had not been receiving their mailer to include other amenities and promotions. Check-in was a breeze - quick. The room was spacious. The view was of roof tops of the Santa Fe but off into the distance I could see the mountains. If I took a hard left view I could see the pool. The bathroom was extremely small, however it was clean. I was surprised that they did not have a coffee maker in the room. Although I am not a coffee drinker, my husband (had he been with me) would of been disappointed. The telephone in the room was missing the card cover to know what buttons to push to call different areas of the hotel/casino. Housekeeping was on top of their game. However, they might want to vacuum the hallways last after cleaning the majority of the rooms on their given floor. It was pretty early when they were vacuuming, especially when I and others had DO NOT DISTURB signs on our doors. The promotions center was very helpful and courteous. Sometimes when I swiped my players card into the kiosk, it seemed a little confusing as how to access particular daily promotions. Cocktail service was pretty good. The buffet was pretty darn good. Had breakfast there (family met me) and also champagne brunch. I was pleasantly surprised that having even the lowest players card, you could get a discount and I was also shocked that champagne brunch was the same price as during the week with your players card (boarding pass) without paying twice the money - very nice perk!! Lots of different foods to choose from. Buffet was clean and service was great. The casino has many slots and table games to choose from. Very large. Night club was hopping. The Slot Manager, Roger, was very accommodating and very nice. Knew all there was regarding the hotel/casino and also viewed him addressing and saying hello to other staff members. So many supervisors and managers of these large hotel and casinos don't even acknowledge passers-by. Although it is not near the airport, it is off the freeway and you would have access to the airport the entire way by freeway access. It was very conveniently located to my family.
Room Tip: I can't complain about my room other than the view... it was a comp (free stay) so no complaints...
