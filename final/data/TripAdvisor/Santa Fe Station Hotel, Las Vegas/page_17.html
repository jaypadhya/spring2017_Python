<html><head><h3>Santa Fe Station Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 17</h3></head><body><br>Great Vegas value.<p>The hotel is not in the most convenient location, unless you are driving to Reno, as I do a couple times a year. But, for the money, you can't beat it. A clean, quiet, up-to-date casino hotel with all the amenities..</p><br>Resort fee includes only 1 cup of coffee! Really?<p>The room was ok, certainly a value for the rate. The bed was really really soft because it was broke down. My big complaint is the "resort fee.". The Santa Fe is hardly a resort. The fee gives you a daily newspaper (free at most hotels), use of gym (again - free), pool (um, hello - it's not even a great pool, and btw, it was January in Vegas = brrrrrrrr), wireless Internet in the room (very nice), and finally (drum roll please) one cup of Starbucks coffee from the vendor in the casino. That's right, you get a coupon for exactly 1 cup, even if you booked a double room. Really Santa Fe? It's bad enough you have to get dressed to get a cup of coffee, but you have to flip a coin with your significant other too.

Solution? Beat them at their own game: bring a coffee pot with you. Good thing hubby thought ahead (only because he hates the in-room coffee anyway).

Not sure which to buy? Get the one I bought:

There are no extras such as a coffee maker in the room. The room could be cleaner. The beds were okay (my wife has arthritis and likes a softer bed). We made a long distance call to Canada from the room phone. 18 minutes cost us $48. Internet was extra, same as most hotels in Vegas.</p><br>Family Fun Close to Snowy Mt Charleston<p>We were unable to stay at the Mt Charleston Resort or Lodge this year on our annual trek to the snow, but easily booked a Santa Fe Station room online with a 5% discount. The snow of Mt. Charleston is just a quick 30 minute drive from here.
Check-in was quick & painless, and the hotel elevators conveniently located not far from the front desk. Our non-smoking room was clean, and did not smell of smoke.
The coupon packet handed to us at check-in came in handy as we received 25% off one entree at Coco's. Dinner was served quickly, and our waiter was very efficient & friendly. The appetizer platter was delicious as were the steak dinners. The kids had mac-n-cheese with sides of fries and rice, plus a fresh chocolate chunk cookie and a sundae (all included in their meal), and were full & satisfied when we left.
After dinner, we bowled at the Santa Fe Station's bowling alley. A little pricey at $40 for a family of four playing 2 games, but fun none the less.
After bowling, we swung into the gift shop, still open at 9:45pm. Admired the sparkly coffee cups and coin purses, but didn't make a purchase.
Had a bit of trouble connecting to the WiFi as our t.v. was blocked. Called the front desk, and they sent a technician (Dwayne) up to the room. He assessed the problem, called the front desk, and corrected the problem. Very nice fellow.
WiFi is a bit slow. Dwayne said only 150 users can connect at once.
Slept well until 2:30am when the loud party girls next door began to shout and laugh. Annoying!
Woke fairly early (7:30am), and went downstairs for coffee (1 free Starbucks coffee coupon in packet).
NOTE: There is no fridge, coffee maker, nor microwave in the room! A fridge can be reserved ahead of time (probably for a small fee.)
The bill was slipped under our door in the a.m. with no hidden fees.</p><br>Substantial hidden charges for services not provided.<p>When I checked in I was told there was an additional $15/day "RESORT" charge on top of the $23/weekday rate. This fee was supposed to be for 1Starbucks Grande/day, wireless internet, newspaper and several other items most people wouldn't use eg.fax. The Starbucks was for coffee only, no frapp, iced latte, or other good drinks, Just coffee. The wireless internet didn't work in my room and the surrounding rooms, so after 2 hrs of useless tech troubleshooting they plugged into cable that was impossiblly slow ie. <0.3 Mbs/sec up and down. This place SUCKS. My wife got sick from the food and vomited alot in the middle of the night. Watch out for Quiznos. Please go somewhere, anywhere else if you value your sanity and life.</p><br>Bad Value Overall - Rooms need improvement<p>Just returned a couple of nights from a trip to Vegas. Stayed 2 nights here with wife and 2 kids. I was disappointed with the quality of the rooms and housekeeping. My specific gripes are:
1. The room and bathroom lighting is not adequate. I had trouble even ironing clothes because it the lighting was poor.
2. The bathroom was extremely small by hotel standards.
3. Housekeeping apparently missed a Nilla wafer left by the previous guest in the room.
4. The amenity fee (resort) is onerous considering it is mandatory. Connecting to the internet is a pain. We used the wireless connection and you have to access the TV menu to use it. This is not typical of most hotels. Also, the room lacks a coffee maker - although you do get free starkbucks coffee coupons

I haved travelled frequently for work and have stayed at many different types of hotels. This hotel feels cheap and isn't really a good value. I have stayed at Motel 6s that were of better quality</p><br>Watch out for a hidden charge when you check out!!<p>We stayed there only one night on a four day trip to Las Vegas. We were seeing a show at the Cannery about 7 miles away on 9/11. The hotel is a far distance from the "strip" and an even longer distance to the airport. A bill will was slid under our door the first night for $14.55 for "customer service". When we called the desk, we were advised this was a charge for everyone for internet, and a newspaper. We never recieved a newspaper and did not use the internet. It was not a lot of money, but I did not like the way it was imposed on the guests. The rate was cheap, $36+tax, and if they had charged $50 for the room and included the newspaper, I would not been upset. I think it leaves a bad impression when done the way it was slipped into the bill. We spent the next three nights at the Casa Blanca, and were very pleased with everything there.</p><br>Chaep price - you get what you pay for<p>Stayed at hotel for three nights on business before checking out and into another hotel. Hotel is in serious need of renovation. First room I checked into the HVAC fan had a loud unusual noise. Changed rooms, nightstand light did not work and on second day table lamp broke. Internet access was horrible, kept losing signal. Carpet in hall and room dirty and stained. Typical unusal smell of second tier casinos, combination of smoke and liquer (do not stay here if smoke is bothersome).</p><br>Beware of this place....<p>Once you reserve a room in the Internet you must pay for it. No cancel, no refunds even if they offer lower prices you are stuck. $14.95 resort fee, even though the spa is broken and the pool is dirty. What you get for the resort fee is 1 free copy of coffee at starbucks and wireless internet and a free newspaper.
The front desk personnel don't care, don't listen, and won't adjust or comp whether anything is working or not. I have heard this place is currently in bankruptcy and I can easily believe it. I don't think any money has gone into the hotel in years.

Do yourself a favor and check around before you commit yourself to a night here. We regret it.</p><br>Okay place to stay cheap off strip<p>I have friends in Las Vegas and I'm not a gambler so this is the perfect cheap place for me. Easy to get around. Centrally located and close to shopping (Wal-Mart is almost across the street. Their's a movie theater in the co-owned Texas Station next door and on the weekends there's a drive-in across the street. If it sounds mundane, well it is! But it's great for what I need in Vegas.
Do be aware that the rates are low but they add about a $15 fee each night....the price is still low.</p><br></body></html>
