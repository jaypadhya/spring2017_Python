<html><head><h3>Santa Fe Station Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 2</h3></head><body><br>Poor Customer Service<p>I booked a king non-smoking room at this hotel using their website. I was returning from a long cross country helping my daughter in the military move. When I checked in I went to my room to find that it was not what I reserved, but a room with 2 beds. I called and talked to the clerk since it was still early in the day I thought she could correct this. She said she couldn't do anything but put me in a smoking king room, because they had over booked. In the morning I talked to another clerk and she said that I can't trust their website and I should have called to make sure it was accurate. They showed very little concern that they had failed to provide me with the room I booked and even blamed their own website. This is not the way to run a business.</p><br>Worse than Holiday Inn<p>We booked this at the last minute, as a cheap Hotwire room on a busy holiday weekend. When we checked in, we were shocked at the quality of the hotel rooms. And not in a good way. While another Station property, Palace Station, provided a great room, the ones at Santa Fe Station are severely lacking. The beds were rock hard, the bathroom was tiny, and everything appeared to be a decade or more old. I don't know if they've recently remodeled some rooms, but it was apparent ours must not have been. Now, I will say that the casino itself was very nice, with a great food court and a fantastic buffet. But the hotel was completely lacking, and not a place I would stay again.</p><br>wonderful hotel<p>we just got back from staying at this hotel, the hotel rooms were recently redone, so there is no smell of smoke anywhere in the rooms, maid service was excellent, they were cleaning early in the morning before 9, the rooms itself are a decent size, king room new mattresses...yes the bathroom is small and I wish someone would have thought of opening the door out instead of in the room, so it doesn't hit the toilet, but that's alright, we were only staying a few days, the food in the Cafe' lux was excellent, 12.99 for prime rib, 18.00 for steak and shrimp. the feast buffet is also cheap eats, so if you are in the area go there to eat. you do need a car to get there, it is 30 minutes from the strip. a lot of locals go here for the bowling and cinema, not to much action at the tables, slot play could have been better, but that is pure luck...hotel itself was clean. courteous staff. security goes around on every floor. you need your room key to work the elevators. elevator is a bit slow, but there are only 5 floors at this hotel, loving the small hotel, so very easy to get around... not so expensive to stay here. I would stay here again.</p><br>Off the Strip<p>A very nice surprise. We had been advise that this Hotel was the closest to our reunion . Great Prices, Clean and lots of choice for Food. Good size Rooms and very nice staff. If you want the strip this is not your place, but if you want a good place to stay in this part of town it's a Great choice.</p><br>Expect the Good &amp; the Bad<p>It all depends on your expectations of an older hotel that charges a little higher than most that are this far from the Strip. The good and the bad should be expected. The bad is that the rooms are very small and do not have refrigerators or safes. Beds were pretty comfortable but pillows were small and hard. The bathroom is another very small area to contend with. The toilet is very low to the ground and there really is no room for personal items. We stayed three (3) nights and housekeeping was a big disappointment. Did not bother to wipe down mirror in bathroom or mop the floor. The good is that the food at most of the restaurants was outstanding. Cabo's Mexican Restaurant was fantastic and a great price. I had the shrimp fajitas and they were cooked perfectly. The Charcoal Steak House was fantastic. Lobster bisque was excellent and our steaks were cooked exactly as ordered and so very tender. Service was outstanding. We ate at the Cafe for breakfast one morning. Again, great service and good food at a reasonable price. On the day we left we did do breakfast at the Buffet. I can see how it gets such high reviews from the locals for breakfast. Eggs and omelets cooked to order. They keep the food hot and tasty. I do not think we would be staying at the hotel again but will be eating there if in the area. Also, great food court open late.</p><br>Smokers Paradise<p>My wife and i live close to this Station Hotel/Casino. She goes over to play the video poker a couple of times each month. I go kicking and screaming when she wants to cash in points for a meal once a month. I have to take a shower when I get home because the place is saturated with cigarette smoke.</p><br>Several Good and Resonable Restaurants at santa Fe<p>Local casino that is clean. Santa Fe has several restaurants worth trying. The Feast Buffet is very good and reasonably priced. There is great Mexican food at Cabo. I tried the Grand Caf√© with my grandsons and was pleasantly surprised. Kids menu items are $5.99 and that includes their drink. I had a great chopped Chinese chicken salad for $10.99. It was huge and delicious. We eat there often because my grandsons enjoy the arcade, bowling alley, and movie theatre.

It's a place where locals may want to stay or tourists who may have friends or relatives that live nearby. It's nice that the casino is downstairs, as well as good places to eat from high end steakhouse to fast food & buffet. They also have a movie theater, as well as a place where you can drop off your children and lounges for music entertainment. You can basically stay and play all in one building.</p><br>DISAPPOINTED<p>To expensive, I requested non smoking room but the rooms next to mine they were smoking so big deal for non smokers. then I charge close to $15.00 per day for "RESORT" what is that for ??? is not a resort !!</p><br>Games without the glitter<p>Located in old Vegas the Santa Fe Station offers all the fun and excitement of Vegas without all of the glitter. It includes a 60 lane bowling alley, a full service movie theater, and all the games you'd expect. The best part is club revolver the place to be on Wednesday Friday and Saturday. If your looking for the games without the glitter hang back a little off the strip.</p><br></body></html>
