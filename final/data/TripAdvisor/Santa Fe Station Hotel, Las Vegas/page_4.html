<html><head><h3>Santa Fe Station Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 4</h3></head><body><br>Substandard<p>I had read other reviews complaining of soiled carpeting and the small bathrooms, but took a chance because of the location, which was on the way out of town for an early getaway towards Reno. However, our room had a wobbly toilet, which in my opinion puts it in the category of a room which should not be rented out until the thing is fixed!
Room Tip: Stay somewhere else.

I found the beds to be quite uncomfortable and the pillows to be hard as rocks I would say yes day here but do you wear it's no four-star hotel or resort.</p><br>I had to stay here. <p>If you enjoy smoke filled dingy and dirty rooms then this is the place to stay. I only stayed here because of a government contract. The guest rooms are disgusting and the bathrooms are the size of a matchbox. The employees that I interacted with were friendly and accommodating. The restaurants on site served some good meals and the food is delivered quickly.</p><br>Better than expected<p>Stayed at Santa Fe for a special occasion and found it to be acceptable accommodations, especially for the group rate I was able to get. Our room size was more than adequate, non-smoking and didn't smell of smoke; however, the bathroom was pretty tiny! Since I travel in an RV most of the time, this wasn't a huge issue for me. Our bed mattresses were covered with anti-bed-bug covers! YAY! :) But, the carpet and floor hadn't been cleaned or vacuumed. I didn't take time to let the staff know - just accepted it. I asked housekeeping for a shower cap and the staff was so pleasant, helpful, and accommodating. We had free internet with our room, but I understood it not to be included unless you paid a 'hotel' fee. Our room (2nd floor even #'d rooms) overlooked a parking garage roof and no view, so we kept our drapes closed the entire time.

We ate in the hotel Cafe twice - which was reasonably priced for portions served. We had a wonderfully personable waitress (Camyille) who took excellent care of us.</p><br>Pleasantly Suprised<p>We stayed here for a family event and normally we would stay on the strip if we were coming to Las Vegas. After reading the reviews on here I was skeptical, even scared. But for the price it exceeded my expectations. My room was clean, and this is very important to me. Yes the bathroom is small, but I am willing to over look that for the $45/night that we paid. Yes it is a long ride to the strip, but it is also less money to stay here per night. Yes it smells like smoke, it is a casino after all. I don't smoke and I don't feel like my room smelled like smoke. Our room was non-smoking.

The staff was nice and helpful. I did not have one bad experience interacting with them. In fact, I found the people who worked the Craps table awesome!

I don't think I would have picked this hotel if not for the family event we went there for, but I can see us coming back for a quick weekend trip. We had a great time!</p><br>Not the best, Not the worse.<p>I stayed here because it was paid for. I got a little reluctant when I read some of the reviews. I did not have to deal with the front counter, so not sure about the rudeness. I will say the room was clean, the bed was ok. The bathroom was a bit dark and small, but again all and all an ok place. The casino was huge, bowling alley, movie house 2 or three restaurants, some fast food places and of course the gambling. I dont gamble so not sure how they paid out. I would probably visit again.
Room Tip: Fifth floor, great views.

Gambling seems to be a little looser in this casino as I started out with $20 and walked away with $300 (of course it was a Tuesday night, so). Anyway, for the price you pay it is a nice place to stay. They have a buffet that has excellent prices on their morning skillet breakfast. It's delish. Enjoy and WIN BIG!!!</p><br>Worst Customer Service Possible<p>I booked this hotel at the last minute through I4Hotels (which I no longer use) and they swore this was a 4 Star hotel. Not even close. It's not bad overall, but I had a discrepancy on my bill and got the worst blow-off I have ever received.
The check-out clerk was rude and dismissive, so I e-mailed the customer service rep. I got a polite standard "We want to work this out" e-mail in return, but when I tried to contact the rep directly - which she asked me to do - I never received any call back. The next month when I was in town, I popped in to see if I could talk to her face-to-face, and the blowoff I got from the clerk was direct from a badly acted sit-com. I left my name and phone number, and never heard from the Customer Relations Director.
Finally, I sent one last e-mail explaining that the whole problem was because of I4Hotels, but that the way they handled this situation was deplorable and I would never stay there or at any Stations hotel ever again. I shudder to think what would happen if there was a real problem.
The room itself was okay, and I did have some fun in the casino, which wasn't too crowded. The shower leaked all over the bathroom.
See my review on their buffet, which I consider to be one of the better inexpensive buffets I've ever enjoyed.
Also, the casino has a bakery counter which has some tasty treats, especially the 7-layer bars.</p><br>Enter at your own risk!<p>Why the poor rating? Let me think... was it the horrible service from the time we stepped out of our vehicle? No real valet attendant- and when a guy finally came over he was tipped after WE requested a luggage cart and helped load it, and thought that a bellhop would be bringing it up to our room. WRONG! Turns out the valet was ALSO the bellhop and we had to wait until finally I ran into a security guard who actually had to help me bring the cart up to our room. Why the poor rating? Could it be that the bathroom wasn't clean- I couldn't use the toilet or tub until it had been serviced. OR, Could it be that the beds had no blankets, and the a/c did not work? Several hours waiting for heat finally a serviceman came only to find that the unit needed to be replaced! The same guy replaced the toilet seat and to my surprise, when I lifted the lid to use it, I found the installment instructions IN THE TOILET! Why the poor rating? Could it be that the WIFI that was included in our reservation was not working and when I finally got connected to the right extention/office personnel for help, they tried to charge me? It was hours before I had any service or access. From an early morning check in time, things weren't straight in our room until after 5pm!!!!!!!!!! While finally resting, there's was no knock, but I heard someone at my door. Thinking it was my companion, I wasn't alarmed, and thought perhaps another guest had the wrong room. When I got up, I saw a paper had been slipped under my door- it was a WARNING from the hotel or its workers telling us that events may be disrupted, and etc, because of a conflict with the management of the Station Resorts (Santa Fe, Palace, & the others) and their workers. What a way and time to let your hotel guests know that you're having employee problems!!! I guest that's why you couldn't get a drink or even water for hours on end without putting in a special request! No room service, nada! Rest? Other reviews have well commented on the smoke-even in the supposedly non-smoking areas. The only reason I didn't give them a terrible rating is because of the restaurants and the security guard that genuinely wanted to help and executed her service beyond her duties. Pay a little more or stay at your own risk!</p><br>Had a great room at a great price<p>I stayed here for one night and had a great room at a great price. The room was large, clean, and quiet with a comfortable bed. The only drawback was that I had to leave a cash deposit, as I wanted to pay cash instead of using my credit card. The deposit was returned to me at checkout. A good place to stay for a little money. I would stay here again and probably use my credit card next time.</p><br></body></html>
