<html><head><h3>Santa Fe Station Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 12</h3></head><body><br>Great service<p>I celebrated my son's 3rd birthday in the Santa Fe bowling center. The customer services we received from Mr.Frenchy was great. He took care of my guests by supplying pizza and drinks on time. My guests had a great time and my son's birthday was a success!! Because of the great service, a friend if mine will be celebrating her daughters birthday at Santa Fe soon!</p><br>Stayed For The Snow, Dining &amp; Bowling<p>Every year, it is our goal as a family to visit the snow at nearby Mount Charleston. In year's past we have stayed at the Mount Charleston Resort, but when they were full, we tried the Santa Fe Station casino in 2010 and again in 2012. This review is for our most recent visit, December 26-27, 2012.

• Quick check-in & check-out
• Smoke-Free Rooms
• Bowling Center' w/automatic bumpers for the kids
• Grand Cafe serving breakfast, lunch and dinner 24/7

CONS: • Smoky, stinky casino
• Coco's Restaurant has been replaced by Grand Cafe - Dinner was great, Breakfast service was painfully SLOW
• Uncomfortable beds, too-fluffy pillows, no comforters, COLD room
• Thin walls - you can hear every door open/close, every conversation in the hallway
• Hard to connect to wifi. Technical assistance was unable to help, and were sending a technician to our room. Had to cancel that call as we wanted dinner & bowling. Upon returning to our room, technical assistance WAS of help via phone (see tip #1 below).
• No stationery, notepads, menus, hotel/casino magazines, dining/entertainment brochures of ANY sort in the room

The elevator to the room by registration has got to be the slowest elevator I've ever been in! Took forever just to get to level 4 and back down again. The layout of our bathroom was really cramped, couldn't use the toilet as the door, if you opened it would hit you. Old style TV as well. Very big casino, it's huge!! Lots of things to see and do. Added plus was the morning paper, but I think all the stations do it except on Sundays as they must think it's too expensive to buy?
Room Tip: I like Sunset Station much better than this one.

Rooms are okay, but old. Bathroom is the size of a porta-potty bathroom. The TV had the 'box on the back' (from Grown Up's movie).

Room was very clean and cleaned well each day. AC worked well. A 12.99 daily 'resort fee' and I'd hardly say they have a resort. Good restaurants on site.</p><br>Well, it was cheap<p>Very poor service at front desk with oddly long wait of 30 min with only three people in line. Carpet looked extremely old. Room was small and dingy and all furniture had serious dings and damages.

Property is right off interstate on north side of Vegas, a way from downtown and even further from the strip.</p><br>Better Than I Expected<p>My husband and I stayed just one night. The room was just what I expected, it was clean and the staff allowed us to check in early. We watched the football game sitting at the bar and enjoyed ourselves. The Monday morning buffet for $4.99 (with our passport card) was very good, and well worth the price. I would agree that the air quality could be a little better, but that was my only complaint. The staff was friendly. I hope to return in the future.
Room Tip: Higher floors have better views of the area.

My wife and I checked into the hotel for a two night stay to clean out a storage unit, so we were extremely tired and sweaty when we returned the first night. When we got into the room, the bed had a broken down frame and was sagging on one side. We slept in it, because the day was long and changing rooms was not going to work. In the morning, we asked to be moved. We were moved, as requested, but upon arriving that night, the air conditioner in our room would not cycle properly. So, it was cooling, then heating, then cooling, then heating. The return air vent was full of dust, and there was a smell of dust and smoke in the room. Once again, moving that night was not going to happen.

So, in the morning, I mentioned it to SELENA at the check out, and she proceeded to say, "I'm sorry you didn't give us the opportunity to fix this for you." Really? I thought general maintenance would be done on air handling systems on a recurring basis, not when a customer complained. so, I asked for the hotel manager's card, and I e-mailed her. I still have not received a reply to my complaint.

As an additional note: We went to three different places in the casino to sit down for a drink our last night. We sat in the lounge areas of all three, and no one, and I mean no one came out to our table to take a drink order. I am not going to force anyone to take my money for an overpriced drink, so we left.

Since we have property in North Las Vegas, we visit regularly, and the Station Casinos boast that they love locals. They love the local's money, but not if it is too much trouble.
Room Tip: There aren't any good rooms that I found.
See more room tips</p><br>Basic<p>I stayed here for 3 nights in October 2012 for business. Let me just say that the staff was pleasant and the rooms were OK. I was on a no smoking floor, however the whole floor smelled of smoke. The air quality was horrible throughout the casino and hotel, they really need to address this issue, people with breathing problems should not stay here.
The gaming floor was adequate, however there were not many table games, and I did not really notice anyone celebrating because of their gambling luck. Several different restaurants were onsite, seemed to be adequate.
The distance from the strip/airport was 19 miles, basically a $50 cab ride. The did not offer any shuttle service to/from the airport or to any attractions. For a property located this far from the attractions, I would think this would be a vital service for its customers. I stayed here on business and did not have a choice to stay elsewhere. I would never stay here if I had the choice based on my experience. Take my advise, stay somewhere else.</p><br>Friendliest place in town<p>The Sante Fe is a basic casino hotel that is not near the strip of downtown. Frequented primarily by locals. Basic room and basic amenities. Comfortable and clean but nothing exciting. Be awre that there are resort fees for use of the pool, spa, gym, etc....</p><br></body></html>
