<html><head><h3>Santa Fe Station Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 1</h3></head><body><br>Would never stay here again,<p>Front desk clerk Monica was very rude! She should not be in the service industry. Also, had to call down 5 times within a 7 hour window just to get towels. We had 17 rooms for two nights and all our guests had the same experience. if you are looking for a hotel do not stay here. Definitely not worth your money.</p><br>Never again. <p>I booked 3 non-smoking rooms for one night through Hotels.com for a recent business trip. Upon arrival, we were told there were no non-smoking rooms at the time we booked through Expedia, we should have read the fine print. No non-smoking rooms were available there or at any of their other properties, but we were welcome to cancel our reservations. This was all explained with indifference. I called Hotels.com, they tried to find us rooms at any other property in Vegas, but were unable to find guaranteed non-smoking rooms. We had driven 4 hours, had to work in less than 12 hours, we were stuck. We were charged $160 each for 2 double rooms and $140 for a king room. The rooms were the nastiest, most disgusting, stinking rooms we have ever stayed in. No fresh air, no filtration, no way to crack a window. It was like sleeping in an ashtray. Never again. If I could rate it with a negative star, it would be -5. I actually considered sleeping in my car as an alternative. Never again.</p><br>Refused to honor my reservation and transferred me to a dump!<p>I, and a group of my friends, booked rooms weeks in advance for a relay race last weekending Vegas. We were traveling from out of town and were all in one van. We needed to be in a specific location for the start of our race. I received a confirmation from hotels.com. I received a call the day prior and was told to call the hotel. I made several calls and was repeatedly transferred to a "supervisors" voicemail When I finally was able to speak with someone to find out why I was contacted I was told they were overbooked and they were transferring me to another property. I told them that was not acceptable as I was carpooling in a van with others and everyone else was staying there and no one else in my group was moved. They did not even provide any information about the property they were moving me to and no documentation, I had no idea where I my room was, how far away it was from my group, nothing. They were certainly not apologetic nor were they even informative. Eventually I spoke to one person and they said I was being moved because I booked through a booking engine.

After contacting hotels.com I was able to find the name and address of the hotel I was moved to. The new property, Fiesta Rancho, was almost 5 miles away and a total dump! Not comparable in the very least, and extremely inconvenient for my team.

Hotels.com could not have been more helpful in trying to resolve the situation. Unfortunately the Santa Fe Station refused to honor my reservation despite the confirmation. I did not get a good nights sleep at the Fiesta Ranco and would never return.

I strongly discourage hotels.com from continuing to offer bookings in Las Vegas of any "station" properties, especially the Fiesta Rancho or the Santa Fe. And I don't recommend staying at either property for any reason.</p><br>Smokers delight<p>Stayed at the Santa Fe for a work trip. Of course you have to walk thru the casino to get to the elevators. If you're a second hand smoke fan, you'll love this place. A haze covers the gaming areas as you walk to your room. The up side rooms are clean, a little sparse on amenities but nice. My non smoking room still smelled. The hallways have a strong cigarette smell and I assume my air conditioner pulled in the smell.

The staff was very friendly, lots of places to eat on the property and has a bowling alley and multi plex theater. So overall not a terrible place to stay. Please take note, the property is 25 minutes from downtown and the strip, there is no hotel shuttle and a cab is about $70.00 one way.</p><br>Happy with their standard king room<p>We were attending a special occasion dinner in the Charcol Room and decided since it would be running late we would get a room for the night. The room was just a standard King room, but it was clean and comfortable. The associates at the Santa Fe Station were very attentive and took care that we were happy with everything. the room is sort of western style, from the old days. There were NO problems.</p><br>Such a ratchet mess! #Upgrade<p>No mini-fridge. No microwave. Not enough plug outlets. No movies on these t.v.'s! All news, politics or poker. Not everyone comes here to gamble or get wasted! We're here as a couple: him for work, me to hang-out (which is really lame here). Never returning. I'm starting to hate all station casinos. Santa fe is a huge mistake. Just don't.</p><br>Major Upgrades Needed!<p>The positive first: Beautiful pool

The negatives: Staff poorly trained, not friendly, and really not helpful at all.
Internet, the slowest and poorest connection speeds on the planet!
5+ minutes to load a basic web page - which makes the resort fee
a complete joke.
Food choices, excellent outside the hotel.
Room, beds were rock hard, furniture dated.
Drapes, sun-bleached. Towels - seriously old. Overall cleanliness -
lacking. Room size, seriously small.

I stayed at this hotel a few years back and everything was excellent, but not any more.</p><br>Kids Quest is a joke.<p>I went to their kids quest on the night me and my fiancee got married. Mind the fact that I dont drink alcohol. I put my daughter in their at 945pm they close at 11pm. Wait why when we first walked in it smelled really bad we kind of hesitated on leaving her. I was on my way walking from getting cashed out by a slot lady. So I tell the lady to hurry up. On my way to pick up my daughter mind you im in the front of the casino which is a ways from the kids quest i get there at 1104pm. They charge me 25.00 extra wait thats not the bad part. I got charged for an 1h and a half my daughter was on there for an hour and 15min. I got to the one at boulder station all the time they tell you if you 15 mintues late theres a fee. Well at this one I suppose if your 4 minutes late you get charged for leaving your daughter at this stinky location. The rep helping us had an attitude. She was really rude and then when I asked about their promotions they didnt know anything. The promos were getting sent to my junk mail. Wow isnt that messed up so I had a coupon for this month and was told it was too late to use it. I hadnt paid yet. My daughter was sleepy i asked why didnt they put her to sleep she made up an excuse as well. Then come to find out my 3 yr old said some kid punched her in the stomach. This play is a joke these women in this facility have no training or experience when it comes to kids. If I pay you to watch my kids. Then thats what you do. My child shouldnt have gotten hit in the first place if they were watching her but that wasnt the case. Really upset. This is outrageous. I dont pay these people for my child to get beat on. Wth. I guess we will never be going there again. I will be contacting their director. Im one mad mommy. This place is a joke. im sticking to my daughters day care. I onky took her so she could have fun but 40.00 for the night sound great now giving the fact that my daughter doesnt get beat on.</p><br>Pass through<p>I will not be coming back. Asked for a smoke-free room got one on the third floor but unfortunately it seems the casino has no control over who can smoke in the hallway who can smoke and leave their nasty cigarette butts by the elevator which I believe they should be caught on camera and find at least $1000 per incident. Unfortunately the smoke was so thick that the nicotine smell in my throat and nose woke me up at 2 o'clock in the morning and couldn't get back to sleep until about four no possibility of opening the windows because they have them Bardshar sad situation Unfortunately the smoke was so thick that the nostrils and I'll smell like nicotine the closest think</p><br>Quiet &amp; Cozy - Away from the Craziness of The Strip<p>I was hesitant to book this place based on the many whiny reviews I read here. But my experience was well worth the drive. Sure, it's about 15 minutes from Downtown and 20 minutes from the Strip. But it's also about 1/3 the price - and you don't have the hassles of parking or the crowds of partying 20-somethings. So I would recommend it highly.

My room was on the 5th (top) floor, at the far end of the hall. A bit of a walk, but worth it: my room was quiet, spacious, king size bed. Very clean and cozy, with a great view of the mountains and overlooking the pool, which by the way was very cool and refreshing after a long flight.

No coffeemaker in the room, but they did give me 3 coupons for free coffee at the Starbucks downstairs - a nice touch.

The staff here is SUPER friendly and welcoming, so kudos to the management for running a fine resort.

If you want comfort, quiet, lots of amenities and on-property stuff to do, I would recommend Santa Fe highly!
Room Tip: Ask for a high floor on the quiet side of the hotel.
