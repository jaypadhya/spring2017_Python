<html><head><h3>Santa Fe Station Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 19</h3></head><body><br>avoid if at all possible<p>If at all possible avoid this low-low rent version of a casino. The pool area is lower grade than a motel 6 and everything stinks (smells bads) and looks very used. It is too far from the stripo to even visit because a cab fee would be outrageous.</p><br>Never Again!!!!<p>I stayed at the Sante Fe Station on business on July 5th-9th after spending the night of July 4th at the Golden Nugget. As we arrived I wanted to go back to Freidmont Street, but this is where our company put us so here we stayed. We had a room in the upper 20's so the trek to and from the elevator was fun (not). The room was decent sized but the bathroom was SMALL, and had very little counter space. The room was clean, the towels and linens worn. The pool was small, full of unsupervised children, a VERY LONG walk around the building (no direct access from the hotel), The food court wasn't bad (the Wing Stop was pretty good, and FatBurgers shakes were delicious), The Cafe was decent, (only had 1 meal there) and we ate at the buffet on our last morning. The food on the buffet was questionable. there were bagels and bread with no way to toast it, no cream cheese, but they had lochs and no cream cheese??? We ate off property ALOT! We ordered room service the first morning and found the menu limited, got a croissant that was cold and hard. It took 3 calls to get anything done and finally a semi warm softer croissant.

The casino surprised me the most, apparently it caters to locals which is fine, but I am accustomed to complimentary beverages when gambling (slots, blackjack) but had to pay for a DRINK!!!!!!!! The only time I received a complimentary beverage was in the poker room, and I spent ALOT more elsewhere in the casino!!

The one ammenity I did enjoy was the bowling alley which was fun. But I WILL NEVER STAY HERE AGAIN!!!!!!!!!</p><br>Santa Fe Station...not so good<p>We spent 4 nights at the Santa Fe Station hotel after working a tradeshow in Las Vegas.
The hotel looks very nice...decor, size, amenities, but we were not impressed.
We had requested a Non Smoking King room. When we checked in, they put us in a Smoking room with a view of the parking garage. We asked if we could change rooms the next day, and we were told yes, just call us after 10 AM and we will switch you. I then called the Front Desk and attempted to do that 3 times the next morning. Each time, I was told "call back later". The 3rd time, I was told "you can ask when you come to the Front Desk, but Good Luck, because we are booked and they won't want to switch you". Also, there is only one elevator to each wing, so if you happen to get rooms 40-50 on any floor, it is a VERY LONG walk to/from the elevator and Ice Machine.
The pool area is stuck back by the loading docks (no view), and is about 1/3 the size it should be for a property this large. Obviously they don't want you spending time at the pool when you could be spending money in the Casino. The only quick option for morning coffee is Starbucks, so be prepared to pay $3.50-$6.00 for a cup of coffee. I will definitely try a different property next time I go to Vegas.</p><br>Smoke Free - No Way<p>My husband and I are of two minds about this hotel. We are not sure if we would stay there again. We have family living near by and that is the reason we chose to stay there instead of The Orleans (which we really love). The down side and I really mean the down side is the smoke in the Casino. The owners really ought to do something about that. The room did not smell, but your eyes were burning from downstairs that it did not make any difference.

Food-wise, we ate two breakfasts at the Cafe. One was perfect and the second day, I could not even eat any of my food. Don't order the cheese and ham omelet. The tiny chopped up pieces of ham are impossible to bite into and the cheese is draped across the top of the eggs. The waitress asked me when she saw I hadn't eat anything if I was a petite eater. Hey, I felt like saying take a look at me, I am anything but petite. The breakfast Buffet looked like the food was sitting there from the day before. However, the fruit was fresh and tasy. To finish off my review of the food, the barbeque restaurant had delicious ribs and plenty of them. Don't order the cole slaw, however.

On the plus side, the room was large and clean. The counter in the bathroom was not large enough for all our toiletries, but we managed.

Staff was very efficient and, best of all, security was good. Our daughter picked us up outside and while we were sitting in the car trying to decide which entertainment spot to go to, we were approached by security as to why we were there so long and quite frankly we were appreciative of them noticing.

Slots by the front door of the reception area were hot and we won a few bucks.

Would we return there again? Not sure, maybe I would call and see how their ventilation system is working.</p><br>Couldn't wait to check out, you CAN do much better.<p>With tens of thousands of rooms in a city, there is no reason anyone should chose this hotel. The place is smokey and nasty smelling.

The long line to check in is staffed by one person who is working really hard to get everyone through, but also appears to operate the switchboard and answer incoming calls. Seeing the long line, a manager walked right by and didn't even help the poor lady at the desk or the customers in line.

The rooms are dark with the usual mystery stains on the carpet. The casino is ok and there is one nice restaurant (the Charcoal room)

This place caters to people who haven't been to the city much or often and those who aren't too concerned with their surroundings. The casino seems to have a lot of locals which might be a good thing.

Anything more than $49 a night is a rip off for this place.</p><br>would recommend<p>We had 2 rooms for 3 days in this hotel. The first night we arrived very late and the toilet did not flush in one of our adjoining rooms. We were too tired to pursue and had a 2nd room bathroom to use. The next day we informed check-in and were moved to another floor with a beautiful view of the mountains (and the roof a/c units if you looked down, but we didn't). I believe we were on the 23rd floor and the view was amazing from anywhere in our room. They compensated us for the inconvenience of having to move and had our bags moved for us.

We LOVED the casino. We have stayed many times at casino's where you get really bored of the casino by the 2nd or 3rd day, but this is not the case here.

We were members of the slot club and got our amazing buffet breakfast comped daily by earning only 100 points (very easy to do).

All in all, we will definitely consider staying here again. The rooms were also very clean. Our only real complaint is that the bathrooms are really small! You would not want to put more than 2 people in a room for this reason. We had no place to keep toiletries because the sink had no extra counter space.</p><br>A Positive Review!!<p>After reading horrible reviews about the Santa Fe Station, I feel compelled to write about my recent stay and come to it's rescue. My daughter, myself and my boyfriend got a comped room through my son's friend at the Santa Fe Station after last minute plans to stay elsewhere fell through. The Santa Fe is located about 20 minutes north of the strip in a suburban area of Las Vegas where I have never stayed before. After reading the Tripadvisor reviews I expected a complete dirty dive, and nightmare experience, however, the total opposite was what we got. The hotel is very nice and done up in a Southwestern style decor and theme. We stayed on the 3rd floor non smoking. The room was very clean, basic and made up nicely. They have several very nice restaurants and a small food court complete with Starbuck's. There is also an enormous 24 hour bowling alley which we had a blast at. A huge movie theater is also located inside the property as well as other kid friendly areas. The pool is small, but this is not meant to be the draw for this hotel. It has a small pool and jacuzzi. In general, everyone was friendly, parking was a breeze, access to the 95 Freeway was easy on and off and we loved it!!! It only took us 20 minutes to drive to the strip to meet the rest of our party. If you are looking for crowds and traffic which is typical on the strip, and or, elegance such as you'd find at Bellagio, Venetion, Wynn, the Santa Fe is not for you. But for a basic off strip Casino/ Hotel, the Santa Fe was GREAT!!! There are also several "Station" hotel and casinos in and around the area, "Santa Fe" being just one of them.</p><br>What a let down<p>Check-in was fine, but that was about it. Rooms were unclean, my 4 year old found 2 moldy grapes under the desk. Light on desk was missing it's light bulb. Beds were really worn and uncomfortable.Carpets were stained pretty badly and Cigarette burns on counter and furniture -Non-smoking??. Also their "Best of Las Vegas" coffeshop award is a joke!! Both times we went to the Grand Cafe, our order was wrong, service was slow, and the price a bit high. If I didn't have a 2-for-1 hotel coupon, I would have left after the first night!!! It's a pity, when we stayed here 5 years ago, pre - STAITIONS, it was very nice.</p><br>Wouldn't stay here again<p>Rooms were dark, dirty and small. Staff was very disinterested. Pool was TINY. Would not recommend this hotel.</p><br>Incredible bellowing toilet<p>Shades of Harry Potter! Perhaps the toilets at Santa Fe Station are haunted. When we flushed ours it moaned, mooed, or bellowed depending on the time of day. In the early morning we could hear these noises all around our room. Evidently there are plumbing issues throughout the hotel. That being said, the room was clean and reasonably comfortable. Santa Fe Station has a large bowling alley, cinema complex and casino. The residential sized pool is tacked onto a far corner, surrounded by construction trailers and equipment. There is a major addition being built, so perhaps the quality of the pool will be improved. We were glad we had rented a car, because this facility is set away from most of the major attractions in Las Vegas.</p><br></body></html>
