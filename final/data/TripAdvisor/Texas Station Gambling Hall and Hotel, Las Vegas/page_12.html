<html><head><h3>Texas Station Gambling Hall and Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 12</h3></head><body><br>Hotel<p>This is a fun place north of the strip. It has a casino and the rooms are nice. I was a little dissapointed the rooms did not have coffee. There is a resort fee added to the published rates, so if you are budget conscious, be careful about that or you will likely be dissapointed. They give you a player card for the casino, which I thought was quite nice of them and easily honored.
Room Tip: I would pick 3rd floor to get farther away from the casino floor.

Hotel is not in the prettiest area of town but never felt unsafe, plus location was convenient to Strip, about 10 minutes away. Room was quite large with decent furnishings, although beds were a little firm for my taste. Brand new flat screen TV. Bathroom was ok, nice oval tub/shower combo with good water pressure, but we had trouble with our sink not draining properly. All in all a good value for what I paid, but I know these rooms can go for well over $100 on weekends & I would not pay that much.</p><br>Nice hotel, very clean<p>I was a little concerned about staying here after reading some of the reviews, but we had a great experience.

The check-in process was great. They allowed us to arrive early, so no lines and a very helpful person at the desk. We were charged the resort fee, but we got a great deal on the room to begin with, so it was still cheaper than other hotels.

I would suggest putting the $100 on a credit card to make sure it's refunded. I don't know why they charge this if you have a credit card on file for incidentals????

Our room was on the same floor as the casino, which concerned me, but they have a security guard at the entrance to the hotel and we felt safe.

Our room was near the end of the hall and very quiet.... EXCEPT for the VERY noisy air conditioner. I was a cool night and we left the window open so we didn't need to keep it running all night. But if we had it probably would have kept us awake.

We played a lot of slots and left winners, which is always good. The casino is very clean and they have a nice variety of machines.

We ate a late dinner in the buffet and it wasn't very good. The food tasted like it had been sitting around for awhile, and not much flavor in it. It might have been better a few hours earlier?

The area it's in doesn't look as run down as was mentioned in other reviews. We parked in the garage and I felt safe there.

Our room was very clean, and I would stay there again.
Room Tip: Put the $100 on a credit card.

When we checked in the girl at the front counter said there is a $100.00 deposit and you will get it back when you leave. I gave the girl $100.00 cash and did not get a receipt be cause we were tired and just wanted to a room.We had reservations. When we left I went done to the front desk and ask about my deposit and the girl said that they would mail it to me. We checked in March 7th - 8th and checked out march 11th 2013. Today it is April 30th and have not heard anything about my $100.00. I called a couple times and faxed them all my information. We went through Expedia Travel so everything was paid for up front. I hope I get my money back so I can write another review with good news.</p><br>Very dirty room<p>Hi! I booked this hotel through Hotwire. I got it for a fair price, but after I booked, it said I had to pay $12.99 plus tax for each day. Not worth it at all, for the same amount I could have stayed at a better place.
The bad stuff? very dirty room, I had to clean myself the bedside table, top of lamps. We moved the table from the corner a little bit to be able to eat something on it and sit on the chairs, and there were crumbs under it. We left the table like that so they would clean it, surprise, we came back and everything, all the crumbs and even a dime were in the exact same place....
the buffet was cheap, but also the food was cheap, you can easily tell that the food is low quality.... won't stay here again! you can hear what goes on outside and when the next door people shower!</p><br>A week in Vegas<p>We booked five nights for $165.90 through 3rd party booking service ($33.18 per night w/tax), plus the resort fee ($14.55 per night, w/tax). The 3rd party booking service didn’t mention the resort fee, but I was aware of it based on other TripAdvisor reviews. I had planned on seeing if I could decline, since I didn’t need/want any of the “resort amenities”; internet, newspaper, fax & copy service @ business center, and fitness center. But I left my cell phone on the kitchen counter, so I didn’t have a WiFi hotspot. Note, internet comes ala carte for $5.+ for service you get with resort fee, or $10.+ for high speed service. If I come back, I would try to decline resort fee and do high speed for $10.+, if I didn’t have hotspot.
Room was satisfactory, clean and as shown on web site. Noise level was typical for this class of hotel, some occasional hallway noise, but otherwise not a problem. We didn’t miss microwave and fridge because of 24 hour food service in casino. I did miss cheap/free coffee in the morning.
Be sure and get “Boarding Pass”, their player’s card, to access buffet discounts. We only did breakfast buffet, it was a good value, lots to choose from, eggs to order, … .
Steak dinner at Austin’s was a good deal, $24.99 for three course dinner, rest of family had top sirloin while I had prime rib. My prime rib was excellent and the sirloin was also reported to be excellent.
We didn't do the in-house movie theater or bowling. Note; free bowling with buffet receipt.
Smoke in casino was noticeable, but their ventilation system handled it well.</p><br>Unless on a super tight budget stay away!!<p>Price is great but know u get what u pay for. Over 30 minute wait to check in. Rooms dirty. Pool small cold dirty and no towels. Car got broken into in self parking area. Gaming cocktail service slow.

There were a few pros- kids club. Clean friendly staff kids had fun a d reasonably priced if your with kids good place for them to play while adults play. Slots.. I won so that's always a plus.

Disappointed in hotel I shared all these comments with them as well with no response.</p><br>GREAT CLEAN KID FRIENDLY PLACE TO STAY!!!<p>So this was our first time taking our kids to Vegas and we needed ajoining rooms, they did it , we needed extra pillows they did it , extra towels they did it all in pretty quick timming n friendly! I have to say considering the price I was berry iffy because we usually pay Triple for.half the time we stayed here! Compared to other places <PH,Luxor, Ext.> Texas station rooms where GREAt and I say that because they where so damn clean n the beds where so comfy n we paid under 375 <including the 13 dollar.resort.few> for.two room, 7 people ,For Four nights including 16 free buffett¡ We still spent a crap load of money but on the GOOOOD FUN STUFF!!!!! So I you CANT BEAT that! my only complaint was that they had us as a standard rooms instead of preferred so I had to.call n remind to restock the Lil extras but not a biggy for what we paid! So people stop complaining about the resort.fees! We defiantly be back!</p><br>Texas Station Resort fee<p>Yes the room was actually clean and looked updated .
We stayed a couple of nights, because we checked in so late(sold out ) we were upgraded to the superior
rooms , better bedding and a fridge . We came back a couple of days later for 2 more nights, after a stay at the Hilton Grand vacation ( very nice ) to a lumpy bed with noisy springs .
There is security everywhere , as the area is a little iffy .
We had a car so it was 5 minutes to downtown and 7-8 minutes depending where on the strip you want to go.
My beef is with the resort/amenities fee at 12.99 plus tx per night .
You get one internet connection , another device and you will get charged . funny I can go to Mcdonalds down the street and hook up 3 wifi devices for FREE.
the fee gave you unlimited fax use , wow ! free local calls and use of the pool , but no towels were out there , and the best is access to the cardio room and when i say room i mean small room about 15 feet by 10 with one low end elliptical that made so much noise , i couldn't take more than 20 minutes on it . 2 treadmills , one that had been broken for 6 weeks according to the service request tag on it , and a stationary bike . no weights . so basically if more than 2 people show up , too bad .
Actually the cardio room is so small some staff didn't even know it existed.
Stay for the cheap rates , but thats about it</p><br>Buffet at the Texas Station<p>Skip this one. While reasonably priced for locals, the food is just OK. I asked the hostess what was their speciality, she looked aside and whispered, go to the Fiesta for a good buffet - the next property to the Texas. Almost reluctantly said the bbq ribs were good. She was right and I only wished I just gone for the ribs. I went ahead and took selections from the Mexican and italian sections, bland and boring. Ribs tho were good.</p><br></body></html>
