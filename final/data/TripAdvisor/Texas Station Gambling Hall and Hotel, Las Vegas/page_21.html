<html><head><h3>Texas Station Gambling Hall and Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 21</h3></head><body><br>Don't Bother<p>I stayed at the Texas Station hotel and was annoyed with the whole experience!The computers shut down and prevented us from checking in for hours (no manual policies?), our reservation was lost, also had problems with room keys and had to have two keys changed before being able to get back into the room, additional charges not mentioned until check-out (and I'm not talking about movies or room service!), original signed receipt "lost" and new one printed with higher rates than agreed upon when first checking in with lost reservation. I asked the front desk clerk to please look again for the original receiot with my signature and she said it was probably filed incorrectly, rather than doing me the favor of taking another look. A week after checking out, my credit card was charged again for an "unknown" transaction, and the hotel manager never returned my phone calls regrdin the whole situation. Seems like a good deal at first, but not worth the hassle in the end!</p><br>Worked for us!<p>The hotel room was clean, maid service was GREAT! The bathroom sink drainage was very loud as well as the toilet. The front desk personnel was adequate, but unfriendly. Check out via the TV was unavailable and neither was front desk personnel at 3a.m. The valet service was virtually non-existant with no porters to help with your baggage. You get what you pay for. We enjoyed our stay, nonetheless!</p><br>Good Clean Hotal<p>Having stayed at both hotels on and off strip, this is defineatly one of the better ones. The rooms were clean comfortable and modern. It might be smaller that other hotels, but has a good range of places to eat and even a food court. There is only one downside to this hotel, they DON'T run a shuttle to the strip.</p><br>Nice off-Strip facility<p>First, the Room...
Clean and modern. Think of a nice Hampton Inn or Fairfield Inn and this would be comparable. The beds were comfortable, the pillows very fluffy and the a/c was ice cold. This is not a large hotel, as most of the business is related to the casino. The pool was very small and located almost in the parking lot. Don't stay here if you are looking for the grand and luxurious Suites of the Mirage and Bellagio.
Second, The Casino...
Texas Station is way way off the Strip and Freemont Street. They cater to the local crowd, so you can get cheap table limits and good food for reasonable prices. They have a large Sports Book, very large Bingo hall and a decent Poker room. There is a food court area with Fatburger, Quiznos, Panda Chinese and a few other sites. They also have an Oyster Bar, buffett and cafeteria. I saw signs for a Movie Theater and bowling center, but did not make it into that area. This is a very big facility.
Lastly, The location...
There is nothing of note within sight or short drive of Texas Station, but it is right across the street from the Executive Airport (North Vegas). With no traffic, this is about a 15-20 minute drive from the Strip area. I stayed here while on a golfing trip, so it was easy to get to the various neighborhood courses. I would not even think of staying here if you don't have a car, or you will have nothing else to do and no other options than what the hotel offers.
Overall, if you don't want the glitz and glamour (or the high prices) of the Strip, then this is for you. This is part of the Station chain of casinos, with about 5-10 locatoins in the greater Vegas area.</p><br>Texas Station is a favorite!<p>This was my 4th trip to Texas Station and as usual it was wonderful! I enjoy the feel of the Station hotels. The staff is always friendly and helpful. My room was ready early each trip. Check in was quick. The room is your average hotel room. Clean and no visible wear and tear. I ate at the Oyster Bar once agian and wasnt dissapointed. The casino has a nice feel as it isnt too big. I signed up for their card and it gave me an extra few dollars to play with in the slots. This hotel does seem to have a lot of local traffic as it is in North Las Vegas and a bit of a drive to the srtip. I would think that families would do fine here with the movies and arcade right in the hotel. I would recomend it to anyone!</p><br>Outstanding!!<p>We were very satisfied with The Texas Station Gambling Hall and Hotel. It was clean, spacious and very welcoming. We used the Public Transportation System CAT and went everywhere. We rode that awesome Canyon Buster roller coaster at Circus Circus! We had the best pina colada ever on top of the Stratsphere. Austin's Restaurant at the Texas was an amazing treat, a perfect meal. We made our reservations through Travelocity. We can't wait to return!!</p><br>good service, rooms just OK, great value<p>We recently held a conference at Texas Station and were quite pleased with the outcome. No, this isn't the Venetian, but at $50 per night, it was a great deal and the service was excellent. The conference center here is just beautiful - much more elegant than the casino or hotel, and we were the only business that day, so we were treated like royalty.
The casino is a good 20 minute cab ride from the airport, so be prepared. And leave plenty of time to return - no cabs come out this way and they have to call them at the valet stand. Better to rent a car than rely on cabs.

The hotel rooms are very plain, but seemed clean and comfortable enough. The bedding could be more comfy, in my opinion. I like extra pillows and had to call for more. The bathroom is just typical, but water pressure and temperature in the shower were both good. The hotel was quiet and the elevators are located right off the casino floor. Be warned that second floor rooms are actually on the bottom floor - a little confusing. The cafe had great food and was very well priced. There is a Starbucks in the casino, as well as a Krispy Kreme and a food court. There was also a huge movie theater, even though we saw no one go in the entire time (it was the middle of the week, however). The casino seemed to be paying here and there but I didn't see any large jackpots. The poker machines had decent pays. Lots of locals here, so afternoon traffic is expected. Evenings are slower. Maybe weekends are different.
I would stay here again (especially with an event in the conference center) but would not recommend it for first time visitors since it is so far from the strip or downtown.</p><br>Nice place except for the rooms<p>Upon check-in you are hit with a $1.00 per day charge for local calls no matter if you make any calls at all. Also hit with an energy surcharge of $3.82. Check in clerk checked in other guest before me even though I was next in line. Room was huge, nice TV and very nice on the surface. An opened bottle of soda was left right next to the night stand from the previous guest. I had the unfortunate experience of checking under the bed.....FILTHY!!!!!! It had not been cleaned under the bed or behind the night stands in over 6 months. I called the front desk to let the manager know about the filthy room and he said he would let housekeeping know about that problem. Well the room was still filthy when I left 6 days later. This was a no smoking room but one could smell someone smoking a pipe. Plus there were ashes all over the hallway. Shower and bathroom were great. Towels were nice and fluffy.For two days there was no bars of soap or shampoo left in the room. However, for two days there were cleaning rags left in the room. Upon checking with other people I knew that were staying at the hotel they said the same thing happened to them and they all reported their rooms were filthy under their beds.The Cafe was wonderful. The staff there knew how to take care of a guest. The waitress for the early morning breakfast went out of here way to make sure everything was perfect. The buffet was interesting....I walked by where the clean silverware and napkins were kept....hmmm...a few dirty dishes sitting on top of the silverware. When I let the hostess know that this was a health violation she immediately took care of the situation. All of the fast food places: Fat Burger, Panda Express, Baja Fresh, plus 2 others were very good and reasonable priced. The 18 movies theatres were great. Finally, the 60 lane bowling alley was nice too. Overall a good experience and I would recommend this Hotel Casino EXCEPT housekeeping does need to get their act together and quickly.</p><br>Texas Station is a great hotel/casino<p>We have been to Texas Station (stayed and played) 3 times now and we feel it's a great value. The staff is always very nice, the rooms are large, clean and comfortable, and access is so easy from the hotel to the casino! The location requires a rental car, and you shouldn't come here if you want a fancy place or a big pool.....only if you want a nice room with great gambling! Lots of full-pay machines, all types of slots, and big casino, not too smoky....movie theater, bowling alley, bingo, lots of food options and the buffet is one of the best in town...omelettes made to order for brunch are the tops! When you get tired of the strip, try this place. It's very comfortable.</p><br>Great value even by Vegas standards, but be warned...<p>Paid $20 per night Sun-Wed and found the room (and the hotel in general) very clean and well maintained, with a very large bathroom.
The hotel has a good selection of both fast food and sitdown eateries.
The casino has $5 single-deck blackjack and $3 craps. This is an outstanding room value in a city known for cheap rooms. We will likely stay here on future trips to Vegas.

Having said that, be warned that this is North Las Vegas and the neighborhood is not quite of the Mr. Roger's variety. Don't get me wrong, my wife and I had no problems during our stay, and never for a moment did we feel uncomfortable. We patronized several stores and the gas station in the immediate area. On balance, this area is no more intimidating than Downtown. But the short drive on Rancho Ave. from the 95 freeway to the hotel provided us with a view a of a large, empty lot that appeard to be very popular with the local outdoor drinking community. We never saw anyone actively drinking as we passed (always by car - the hotel is only a short drive to the Strip or Downtown, but it's too far for walking), but a very large pile of bottles indicated a definite indifference to collecting the remdemption value. If this sort of thing gives you pause, I would suggest a hotel on the Strip.</p><br></body></html>
