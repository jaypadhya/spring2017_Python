<html><head><h3>Texas Station Gambling Hall and Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 20</h3></head><body><br>Nice Casino/Food Offerings, Rooms OK<p>This is a decent hotel for the money, especially if you want to gamble and are looking for a big casino with lower limits than you find on the strip. The casino floor I was told was the 2nd largest in Vegas next to MGM and there were many food offerings that cator to most every taste. From a nice steak house to Starbucks to fat burger and their buffet....there's a nice selection of choices.

The only negative is you are off strip and the hotel rooms themselves are fairly basic. We came for a wedding where the reception was at TS and had stayed at the Mirage for 3 nights prior. They were about $15 cheaper than Mirage, but the rooms werent even close in quality.

The pool is your small basic hotel pool on the small side, but clean...however if a pool is important to you this isnt really the place to be. If gambling is your game, TS offers a great casino experience. But if the strip hotels arent considerably more expensive I would choose them in a heartbeat, take the deuce downtown and gamble there while enjoying all the strip offers.

Neighborhood is on the bad side but if you arent doing any night time walking it shouldnt matter and they have security in the parking ramp. Overall, good value if the stip is too costly as it is during some conventions and such. Casino is very good, many locals come here to do their gambing.</p><br>Overall Okay Stay<p>We stayed at the Texas Station last week and I must say I was impressed with the overall service for the price we paid.

Coming from a hospitality background, here is the real nitty gritty on this property.
*The Front Desk agents were a hit or miss. The young lady that checked us in gave us an upgraded room at no charge. GREAT!!! All our requests were honored. Later on, another agent that checked our friend in was not the nicest in the world.
*The room was okay. We got an accessible room, which we didn't mind. The only thing was that the shower curtain was so close to the shower head, you had absolutely no elbow room. Every other second you were trying to peel off the shower curtain from your body. This was so bothersome we ended up not using the shower curtain, hence causing the floor to get wet.
Cleanliness in the room was not a problem. Our housekeeper Melinda was amazing. She was always on time and always had our room prepared by the time we got back. Walter, the Houskeeping Supervisor gave us a friendly call if we left our Do Not Disturb Sign to check if we would like our room done. A++++++for Housekeeping.
*Food was at the buffet was good. Nothing out of this world.
*Casino was certainly bigger than I expected. The pictures do it no justice. It was huge. The only down side was that whenever we wanted a drink, we felt we had to hunt down some of the waitresses. Some of them were even rude!
*Only one small gift shop, so not much shopping. Althought the lady in the gift shop on Saturday Afternoon was extremely rude, like it was painful for her to smile.
*Pool was small. Nice for a quick dip but nothing to write home about.

Extra Tips:
*This hotel is a bit off the strip so I would recommend renting a car. Taxi's are a bit expensive!
*Book directly through the hotel, don't book through a third party. The hotel always has the cheaper rates. As you get closer to the date, go back to the website and check the rates again, a lot of the times the rates drop. We saved about $200 that way.

Good Luck...Oh...and Vegas is REALLY HOT!!!!</p><br>Customer Service: A+<p>Readers, the Texas Station is one of the friendliest places in Las Vegas. I am a veteran of 15 trips to LV, and the staff makes a great deal of difference. Here's the story:

I was finishing the last leg of my 1700-mile drive to Las Vegas, right about lunchtime. I was due to check in downtown at 2PM, and it was 11 AM, so I picked a half-price buffet coupon from the American Casino Guide for a "convenience-store-themed" casino in town. After a 15-minute wait in line, the cashier pointed to a sign ten feet away, which read "You must have your player's card to use any coupon." Aggravated, I left.

I took I-15 up to Lake Mead, turning west to go to Texas Station, where I knew the buffet was great. There was no line, and the cashier asked for the PIN to the player's card I had brought from the last trip. I did not have a PIN, having been out of town for 6 months. She gave me the players' discount, ANYWAY! The buffet was outstanding; what was even better was the feeling that I was welcome. Texas Station went out of its way for me, when I was SO tired.

After eating, I played in the clean, airy casino for an hour, before returning to downtown. I got a new card from the player's club window; ALSO very friendly! The hundred-play video poker paid for the lunch buffet and tip. I came back to play and eat three times at the Texas Station during the week before I actually checked in, all as a result of the friendly atmosphere.

There was plenty of blackjack at the Texas, and the sports book is massive. Multiple baseball games on adjacent flat-screen TVs? Cool.

The rooms at the Texas are clean and well-equipped; convenient to the casino, pool, buffet, and bowling alley. During the days I stayed at the Texas Station(one week after I arrived), I never left the premises. Prices are depressed in Las Vegas, so room rates were excellent, too. The pool was very small, but is OK for people-watching and a quick dunk. Parking is easy and shaded; I like the side lot(just South of the buildings)

Texas Station is convenient if you drive or rent a car, but pretty far away if you rely on taxi service. It is at the corner of Rancho and Lake Mead, in North LV. Fiesta Station(ick) and a few local video poker joints are nearby. TS is also the best hotel close to Nellis AFB.

I'll be staying at Texas Station again.

Happy travels,

Gene Padgett!</p><br>First visit, but not the last.........<p>First time stay at this particular Station casino, with previous stays at Boulder and Sunset . Texas ranks right in the middle of those two. The casino is huge, with 10/7 VP pay outs. Normally you can find $5 minimums on table games, or even $3 BJ.
The hotel only has 200 rooms, but they are spacious and very clean, with amenities found in all Station hotel rooms. The pool is smaller than Sunset but still quite usable. Good food at the buffet. If you like the Orleans, Sam's Town or the Gold Coast, you'll feel right at home at Texas Station.</p><br>Great Value with Theatre and Bowling Lane on Site!<p>Stayed here for a conference. A fairly big hotel/casino and tons of parking that seems to cater more to the close-by visitors than tourists. Surprisingly there were not that many people staying here during my trip and the place was quite quiet, comparing with the Strip.

Rooms were very clean even the carpet was slightly tired. Furniture and bathroom were quite new and with basic amenities. Liked the morning paper as well as the easy setup WiFi.

A few restaurants and a small food court were on site. Food was okay if you want something quick and simple. The 18-screen movie theatre was a plus and the 60-bowling lane (did close at around 1am) was a big bonus!

Because of 2 conferences were going on, it cost us about $850 for 2 rooms and 4 nights with car rental, which was way more than they normally charge.

Great place to stay as it has everything on location. It's also an excellent place to stay if you have a car and want to explore more than just the Strip such as Hoover Dam. For the conference I went to, it did take about 25 to 35 mins to drive to the south of Strip (MGM Grand) in morning "traffic."</p><br>Good Value off the strip<p>Considering the price we paid ($36/night) from hotels.com, this was a steal. I was a little miffed that the hotel charged me a $5.99/night "hotel service fee" that was not included in the hotels.com price, but hotels.com refunded this to me when I called (so kudos to them). Wireless internet access is $11.99 per laptop per room.

Texas Station is way off of the main strip in Vegas, and is targeted at an older crowd, but it was exactly what we were looking for. We don't gamble, so the less harried pace was actually ok with us. The beds were ok, but the pillows were way overstuffed for our taste.

They have their own players card (like most casinos), and they give you a little bonus for signing up. I got $15 for signing up and my girlfriend got $3. So not bad.

They have a really good buffet that we got for almost nothing (buy 1 get 1 free in the daily hotel newspaper and reduced price if you sign up for the players card. So $7.99 total cost for the 2 of us.) There are also many other restaurants in the rear like quiznos, salsa fresh, burgers, etc.

One tactic made us laugh. When we checked in, they offered us an "upgraded" room. This basically only means you get a chocolate bar, a couple bottles of water, and some popcorn. That "upgrade" was $25! We declined and then they said they would give it to us since that is all they had. I'm pretty sure they just put that stuff in every room so they have the opportunity to catch a sucker here and there willing to pay $25 for popcorn. If you decline, then they make you feel special by giving you an "upgrade." We had to laugh at that!</p><br>Enjoyed my stay!<p>It was a nice hotel outside the "strip". It was cozy, but also a bit loud especially in the lobby. It was big, clean and had everything. It's perfect for a short stay - but you will definitely need a car if you want to go places.</p><br>Good deal for the money and great for kids<p>My wife and I stayed here for one night. For $45 per night it was a very good deal. The room was clean; the bed was comfortable and the bathroom was huge.

Plenty of family fun available. There's a movie theatre, day care and bowling alley in the hotel. There's also a zoo a few blocks away.

Only negative was that they snuck a $5.00 facility charge on our bill, but even at $50 a night total, it was worth it.

Recommend!</p><br>Warm in Texas!<p>I left the fridged Chicago lake front on 20 below morning and headed to sunny Las Vegas. My destination this time was The Texas Station. Remember this is a bit of a distance from the strip, so be sure to rent a car. Upon walking up to the check in counter I was greeted by a very nice young lady who new what she was doing and did it quickly [with a smile I might add]. The staff in the restraunts and on the floor were all very nice and seemed eager to please. Although not an overly fancy, the room was nicely appointed in a "western" motiff, and it was clean, well appointed and had an EXCELLANT king size bed that I was very comfortable in. I wouldn't want to take a stroll around the neighborhood at night but then I wasn't there to sight see anyway. All in all my Texas Station experience was very nice, affordable and warm.</p><br>good place for a conference<p>Third trip to Texas Station for a conference. Great conference area with awesome catered meals. Casino is large but we didn't win much on the slots. VP seems to pay OK and we saw several Royal Flushes during the three days.
Rooms are decently large and clean. Nothing fancy. Bed was comfortable although an extra pillow would have been nice. TV was large but the air conditioner was so loud that it was hard to hear (the neighbors called security on us one night at 11pm when we tried to turn in up loud enough to hear the news). Imagine that - getting busted by security in Vegas for a loud TV, of all things. That was pretty hilarious.
The bathroom was considerably larger than I expected. The oval bathtub was recessed back into an alcove. There was a large vanity with a hair dryer, but they skimped on the toiletries and only gave me shampoo and lotion, nothing else. For $69 per night, we didn't expect too much. The only real downside to the hotel were the loud air conditioner, no view out the window - and I mean NO view, only a wall a few feet from the window and a closet "alcove", which means just a rod with no door. The cafe is pretty good and the steakhouse is wonderful, albeit pricey. You need car to stay here since cabs take a while (there are no cab lines waiting here) and costs $30+ from the airport.</p><br></body></html>
