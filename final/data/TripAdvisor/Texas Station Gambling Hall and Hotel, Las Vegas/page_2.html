<html><head><h3>Texas Station Gambling Hall and Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 2</h3></head><body><br>Not like Texas at all.<p>Upon arriving I was promptly told that all though I reserved a king room they do not guarantee the type of room, only that I have a room was reserved. What? Then I had to surrender my id to get a luggage cart. What? The room they chose to save me was not very clean and had no coffee, fridge and barely a end table. TV was good, beds fine. We had a group of 20 rooms and 1/4 of them were not cleaned when they checked in and some were just plain dirty. The casino had more security guards than people which left you with the feeling it was not a safe place to be. Food was good in cafe and buffet. Slots a little old but kept you playing a little while. I know this is picky but all over the place they had poppies and if you know Texas like I know Texas Blue Bonnets should have been used. personnel with exception of check in clerk were all nice and it was convenient to have a Starbucks inside.
Room Tip: don't stay here
See more room tips</p><br>Nice experience at Texas Station<p>Well priced, beautiful hotel with nice amenities, restaurants, 60 lane bowling center, 18 screen movie theater and comfortable rooms. Pool could have been larger and nearby was a drive-in theater. It was off the strip which was a plus for us.</p><br>Thieving Housekeepers<p>I got back from Vegas a couple days ago, and something special happened at Texas Station, where my wife and I stayed over the weekend for 3 nights of our 5 night stay.

On the final day, even though I did my double check, as we were leaving the room, we forgot my wife's 2 purses, an MK and a Coach. My wife was frantic. We looked through the car, the luggage, the hotel room at the Mirage - all of them several times. After we ate at a buffet, I called Texas Station, got through to the hotel, and confirmed we left the purses there. Said we would pick them up after our show.

So we got to Texas Station, went to the security podium the officer behind the counter took my name, and room number 4 times in 5 minutes... and were offered 2 purses, a Zebra Stripe and a Leopard Print purse. The description in the hotel said black/white and brown!!! We came all the way there for this? Wife was panicking again.

Then the normal security came back from break, and took over. Yup the purses were there, they were still in the back of the house. A supervisor would bring them to the front. About 10 minutes later, me had the MK and Coach bags. Signed the paper accepting the return of the bags... and my wife started going through to make sure everything was there.

Our wedding rings were missing. They were in a small coin purse (we had them cut off a few years ago due to poor circulation on those fingers). The coin purse was sealed, but the rings were missing.

Since we were still at the podium, we made a report. Was told that they can't just go accusing the housekeeping staff, and there was nothing they could do. The rings weren't super valuable, but the sentimental value was there.

So... paid 3 nights, paid for a party of 35 at the buffet, lost money at the slot machines and table games, lost our wedding bands. All in all this will be a memorable weekend, and a reason to avoid staying at Texas Station or for that matter at any other Station Casino property for a while.

I can understand why you won't be liable for theft in the rooms, but theft from within our things, shows you have some thieves working for you.
Room Tip: Rooms furthest away from the elevators are the quietest
See more room tips</p><br>Nice Hotel<p>Stayed here for job purposes only because I had never heard of this hotel before. My job paid for a large group of us while we were there working. The rooms were very nice and secure. I was surprised to have a large bathroom as well. I would recommend it for those that would like to be away from the strip but not too far.</p><br>Check in staff<p>Some not all need a lesson in politeness. Room was great,housekeeping barraged in clearly the do not disturb sign should have alerted her I needed no services. Tip hungry I suspect was her motivation for entry. Other than a fine stay.</p><br>Really needs an update <p>I remember when Texas Station first open some 20 years ago. It sure has changed. We used to frequent the movie theaters all the time, but not no more. The whole place needs an update. The rooms are large but very outdated. The theaters just seem dirty and the casino smells like an ashtray. The pool is microscopic, barely big enough for 10 people. It's not horrible, but time is taking its toll on Texas Station.</p><br>Average, at best<p>The price is certainly right, very inexpensive. I live nearby and stayed here while having work done on my house. I love the ambiance of the casino area...it's like a twilight Texas BBQ and I go there frequently for a quick bite to eat and a movie.

But for the hotel...meh. Comfy enough, but nothing amazing. The rooms are in bad need of an update. The daily cleaning does a marginal job (at best). The rooms are large, as is the bathroom. Completely unimpressive though. No in-room coffee, but it's good to be able to wander down to the casino and grab a quick bite 24/7.

I'll continue to stay here as long as it remains convenient and the price remains low, but if either factor is not in your favor, I'd recommend looking elsewhere for a hotel.</p><br>tripled billed for room<p>Made reservations for rooms and was told that we needed a credit card to hold the room which was ok, they said it would not be billed to the card. We got there and they had the room beds mixed up. They also added a 100 dollars to the reservation for each. This is all in addition to the resort fees that are 14.95. Then they charged my son in law for the room and 100 because he got there before us. When we checked out the again billed us for the resevations. This all stared out with a lie that stated the room prices was 86 dollars that was advertised on the Internet. The worst part of this it was the hotel's resevation office that book this for us. Every time we talked to the front desk personnel we got different answers on if they were going to credit it back to the card and how long it would take to get the charges fixed. I would never stay here again and would abvise my friends and family to look else where if going to stay in Las Vegas.</p><br>Nice for a night<p>The room was alright. Comfortable, clean, very basic. Good for the price. Casino was pretty cool, had some character and characters. Upon arrival we were given a free coupon packet with a free cocktail, free bowling and other good stuff. If you're looking for a drink around 5-6am, the bartender that was working the morning shift makes killer drinks. Buffet was good and decently priced. Creole food was amazing, everything was good too, fried chicken was top notch. Bang for your buck ratio is awesome, bon appetite.</p><br>Great casino hotel n Las vegas <p>Texas station is a great place to stop and gamble and stay in North Las Vegas. Hotel rooms are clean and larger than you would expect. Not to mention room rates are responsible and inexpensive. Casino is very large with huge number of slots but a limited number of table games. The hotel buffet is under the average for dinner.....many items were near cold...however the buffet has a large selection. Garage parking to hotel check in is a long walk. Convenient drive to either downtown LV or to the strip.</p><br></body></html>
