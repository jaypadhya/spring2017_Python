<html><head><h3>Texas Station Gambling Hall and Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 6</h3></head><body><br>Doesn't live up to its potential...<p>I'll start with the good things...

The outside of the hotel looks great. There is a gift shop that has some really nice items that are actually affordable. The buffet is fantastic! They have American style food, Italian, Chinese, Mexican and some others. Great desserts. The buffet staff is super friendly. There is also a gym, movie theatre, bowling alley, pool and some other great amenities that gives this place a lot of potential. There is also a massive parking garage so you never have to search for a place to park! Now for the not so good stuff...

This was my first time going to Vegas. Originally my cousin and I had reservations for Thursday, Friday, and Saturday nights. Due to a storm in our area we weren't able to leave until Friday. My cousin called Priceline (who we booked the reservation through) and had them change the reservation to Friday, Saturday and Sunday. We arrived around 2 AM and found out they canceled our reservation because we were "No-Shows" on Thursday... They claimed Priceline never changed the reservation even though Priceline and my cousin both had confirmations that the reservation had been changed. They didn't want to give us a room and claimed that they were all booked. My friend told the staff worker that she wanted to speak to the manager and at first the girl refused. Finally the girl called the manager and my cousin spoke with her. Then they wanted to charge us a different price than Priceline. The manager finally agreed to the Priceline price that we had reserved and somehow they magically found an available room. You know, one of the rooms that were all booked just minutes before!

I got to the room and the shower was dirty. After giving it a quick cleaning I attempted to take a shower. The water pressure is horrible. Rain gets my hair wet faster than their shower! The water did warm up immediately, so that was a plus. The tub is an oval shape, but too narrow and when I tried to take a bath my shoulders were pushed forward so far it probably looked like I was trying to push my breasts together! Most of the water drained out from the "overflow drain" within a minute, leaving me taking a bath in a few inches of water.

The faux crown molding in the room was actually nice, except for the section where they didn't even bother to line up or match the ends to make them meet. They just overlapped it. The beds were so horribly old that they sounded like they would break just from sitting on them. The mattresses were also horribly old. When I laid down on the bed I could feel that the side of the mattress closest to the nightstand was actually slanted from the amount of people who had slept in that spot in the past. Each bed had two pillows and one log pillow. The log pillows had massive tears on each end that clearly needed to be repaired. The ends/posts of the headboard also looked dirty, as if someone had spilled something on them and it ran down the end/posts.

There is no soundproofing whatsoever in the rooms and I could hear people further down the hallway talking and yelling as if they were in my room. And this was even at 3 AM. I get that it's Vegas and people are there to party and do whatever but I would think that they would at least give the rooms some soundproofing for those who are there on business or there with children and aren't partying at 3 AM.

Oh, and the T.V. didn't work. I checked the remote, but that was working. Pushed the power button on the T.V. itself and nothing happened. I checked the power strip the T.V. was plugged into and got that to work, the lamp that was plugged into that started working. The T.V. still would not work. I plugged the T.V. into the wall outlet instead of the power strip and it still would not work. Pretty sure the T.V. either died or a previous roomer stripped the T.V. of components that it requires to work.

It's as if this place takes no pride in their rooms looking and being decent.

Then when I came back from lunch at the buffet my key cards wouldn't work. Turns out housekeeping locked me out even though my stuff was still in the room. I went to the front desk to have them reactivate my key cards and the girl told me they couldn't do that. When I told her my stuff was still in the room she looked in the system and didn't understand what was going on from our check in. I explained the situation to her and she called the manager who made her give me new key cards. It also sounded like she was arguing with the manager over the phone. I heard her say something like, "I'm not supposed to be dealing with this!"

You and me both, honey!

The last bizarre thing about this place is that the floors do not coincide with the elevator. In a normal building when you enter you are on the ground floor and to get to floors 1, 2, 3, etc. you go into the elevator and press the button coinciding with your floor. In this place the ground floor is actually the first floor. My room was 102 and to get to it I had to press G (ground floor button) and go down instead of pressing 1 and go up. Very strange.

Like I said, this place has a lot of potential with its amenities but either housekeeping or the management don't care about the rooms being decent or the hotel owners are hindering the management from being able to make sure the rooms are updated and decent. Either way, something is not right here and I wouldn't stay here again unless things are changed.</p><br>Thank you Becca<p>I went to the locals spot a couple of times this week. Some friends like the promotions and rewards program. So I went and had fun. I didn't win gifts but I did will points. I also eat in the food court instead of the cafe. I enjoyed myself, But the best part was the way that the rewards staff treated me very nice.I learned many things about the rewards program that I didn't know before.
The positive smile and personality for Becca made my day. Thank you Stations casino for hiring such and nice person.</p><br>Ok budget hotel<p>This hotel is pretty average for anything in Vegas. The service is ok, and there rooms are decent. The breakfast is better than a lot of hotels. The resort fee makes it hard to compare the price though.
Room Tip: Note the resort fee.
See more room tips</p><br>Old but clean<p>First time here. Hubby playing In a golf tourney. When you check in this place looks small but it's huge! There are 6 bars, several restaurants, a food court and a buffet. All are reasonably priced. The room is old but good size and very clean. The pool is close by. (I don't understand why their web site doesn't mention a pool??) The room and the casino are very clean. This place is definitely a bargain. It's not very close to the strip but is close to the Outlet Mall. All in all, I would stay here again. MUCH better than Santa Fe Station!</p><br>Very good value overall...<p>Not my favorite place by any means, but the room was fairly spacious and clean, the beds were comfortable. I enjoyed the buffet breakfast ( $6.00) and the service was very good overall. I noticed the lights were out on the most of the outside of the hotel when we arrived.I guess they are trying to save on electricity.I respect that. If I stayed at a Station hotel again, I would probably stay in Henderson at Sunset Station, as there is much more shopping (Costco,Wal-mart,etc.) closeby.They have the same promotions with the buffets and Henderson is a nicer area than this one.I also feel that the resort fee is a waste of money. $15 extra on top of the room is crazy, but this is normal for Vegas these days.</p><br>Not as good<p>we stayed here a few years ago and really enjoyed this hotel+casino,so we were looking forward to staying here again.
The room was nice and clean and so was the casino,we ate in the feast buffet twice breakfast and lunch and we were disappointed with the food,we also ate in the grand cafe the food was good but there was dust on the shelves and ornaments not as clean as I remember it.
Also why the resort fees put it on the room price so it's not a shock when checking in, had a good time in Vegas and can't wait to come back but maybe not to texas station ( sorry ).</p><br>Good location off strip, but if you are looking for lots of amenities go elsewhere<p>Just returned from Las Vegas and stayed at this hotel for 4 nights. Family lives close to this hotel/ casino, that is why we chose to stay here so it was a good location for us. If you are looking for a hotel that is cheaper, this is for you, but it is a good 5 miles from the strip. The rooms are in dire need of a facelift, the water in the sink had no pressure, and we had 3 people in our room and were only provided 2 towels each night even after requesting more. No amenities are provided, coffee in room, microwave, etc yet they charge a nightly resort fee. We didn't spend much time in the room or at the property, as we were with family, but I think we will choose another property next visit. As far as the casino, we did spend a little there, with no luck. Didn't not eat at any of the restaurants, but did purchase coffee from the Starbucks in the casino. The area is somewhat rundown & shady too, but never felt unsafe. They have security walking/biking through the parking lots.</p><br>good deal - good place<p>I continue to be a fan of the Station Casino and hotels ....good prices, good staff, clean, quiet rooms and multi-service options.
There is a buffet that is 3 meals a day - $6 breakfast, $8 lunch, $10 dinner, with a players' card. includes any non-alcoholic beverages....how do you beat that price???
So convenient to have casino, room, bingo hall, small, outdoor pool, bowling alley, theatre, bar and restaurants in one place. At this location, there is a Walmart behind it. It is about 8km from the strip...we had a rental car so no issue...
Staying off the strip allows for cheaper food prices, local stores and less crowd.
Would return for sure...just be aware that there is a daily fee, which I don't know why they don't just include the price in the overall rate of the package we booked re: flight, hotel and car...</p><br>Good Price - Decent Hotel<p>I often have business in Las Vegas and I don't like to hassle with the strip so I have stayed in several off strip locations.

This is the 2nd time I have stayed at Texas Station.

Two primary reasons to stay here - price and proximity to my work.

I don't gamble, so the casino is lost on me.

However, the rooms are nice. Good sized and quite clean. They are comfortable. The bed is good and the pillows are good as well.

The casino is smoky and I found a way around having to walk through the smoke in the casino to get to my room.

The staff is helpful.

There is now a $100 deposit fee charged to your credit card as a deposit and is supposed to be refunded a few days later. That is on top of the $14.95 resort fee charged. Even with that, the room is very reasonable.

The property has several chain restaurants and a movie theater, both of which I have used. That was very convenient.

The place has a pool but it is small and located next to the parking lot so that is not the reason you would stay here.

For my purpose of locale, clean and comfortable room, this fits the bill nicely.

I will stay here again, when I need to be in this area.</p><br>Family oriented with a daily breakfast buffet!<p>We were in need of a family hotel for our two week vacation and the kind and talented folks at Las Vegas Chamber suggested this hotel. It was a little smoky in the halls during the evening if the hall doors were left ajar that lead to the casino floor but in the morning there wasn't a trace of cigarette odor. Rooms were very reasonable and comfortable. The daily breakfast buffet was supported by the casino because our kids ate more than $5.00 worth daily. It was a delight to watch these male teens choose their own food and enjoy the delight of quantity. Texas Station permitted us to play road hockey in their parking lot and boys enjoyed the Arcade, ice rink and bowling alley, the latter complete with a restaurant! The hotel was on the outskirts of Vegas but with their highway system we were only 20 minutes from the Strip. https://texasstation.sclv.com/</p><br></body></html>
