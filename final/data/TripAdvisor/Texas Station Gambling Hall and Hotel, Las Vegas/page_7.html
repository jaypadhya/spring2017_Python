<html><head><h3>Texas Station Gambling Hall and Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 7</h3></head><body><br>Oyster Bar at Texas Station Casino<p>I found an article that listed the Oyster Bar at Texas Station Casino as one of the few places that serves Manhattan Clam Chowder (the red version of Clam Chowder). I decided to check this place out. This looks like a nice place for seafood and the prices are decent. I had a bowl of chowder for $6 and decided to try the fish and chips for $10. The chowder was amazing. Lots of clam bits and tomatoes, celery, etc. with just the right amount of spicy kick. The fish and chips were good too: crunchy batter crust and lightly seasoned.
The only drawback was having to walk through a smoky casino to get to the restaurant.
I apologize for not being able to review the rooms here. There are no entries for this restaurant on TripAdvisor.</p><br>Texas Station Visit<p>The staff was exceptionally friendly, Great bargain price. The room was very spacious and clean. Bathroom was large, also. Nice tv. Appreciated the large mirror behind the bathroom door. The towels were rather rough and scratchy, requested additional towels and they were delivered within 5 minutes. Luckily, I am not a coffee drinker, as there was no coffee maker in the room. There were plenty of lamps in the room, however, it was not quite bright enough for me. The hotel is a just a bit off the freeway away from the strip, but still close to downtown Las Vegas. Buffet was cheap and offered an excellent variety of foods. Thoroughly enjoyed that. This was an excellent place to stay at a great price. Plenty to do right in the casino. Thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would definitely stay there, again. Highly recommend if you want to stay in an inexpensive place that is not on the strip.</p><br>Would come again!<p>I enjoyed my stay here. The staff was very nice. Everyone that i encounter were very attentive.The buffet I really enjoyed. It's a movie theater, a bowling alley and bingo hall all in this one place. Also the drinks I had weren't watered down. I will definitely come back.</p><br>Texas Station Hotel and Casino<p>Although this Hotel and Casino is more than 10 years old, improvements and revisions have been done to keep all facilities up to date. This is a family oriented hotel and is a branch of Stations Hotel & Casinos in the Nevada area.
The food is excellent and the rooms are very roomy. Security is also commendable as this is a family vacation destination.
Part of the activities in this establishment is a cinema complex and bowling lanes, as well as a well appointed pool area.
Parking is no problem, as parking areas are available in buildings with three levels and in close proximity to rooms and amenities.
Room Tip: Standard room amenities include free wifi, a hair dryer and a hot iron for clothes. Smoking rooms a...

I am a truck driver and stay in lots of hotel's around the country this was actually one of the best.</p><br>Average hotel, but inexpensive<p>We stayed here for a week for my son's bowling camp. Rooms are reasonably priced. Buffet was good. Room was clean, however the bathroom smelled very mildewy. Our safe didn't work. Had security come look at it. Needed to be fixed, but no one ever came back. :(

The staff was very friendly. Bowling center top notch.</p><br>Summer Vacation<p>It was excellent, enjoyed the food court, movie theater, swimming pool.. To bad there was not a jaccuzzi overall excellent stay... Thanks!!!! Will come back and stay again. Rooms were very clean. Service fee did not like?</p><br>Good for gambling<p>I wanted to try a new place away fro the strip I enjoy how there is a lot to do. There is bowling a movie theater plenty of food restaurants. If you like lots of room and not to many people go here they have enough slots. The bingo hall was fun to good pay out. I stayed at the hotel to the room was OK.</p><br>Not surprised it's out of the way<p>This property is one of th several "Stations" I've stayed at in Las Vegas. Although there was adequate covered parking, if you are travelling with a family or a group, with several pieces of luggage, be prepared to cart your luggage inside yourself as there was no bellperson assistance.
The room, itself, was adequate, for a short stay but I would not recommend it for more than a couple of days.
Room Tip: If you want something, off the beaten path and away from the Strip, then you might consider it.
See more room tips</p><br>Not so great<p>Stayed there 4 nights with 2 teenagers for a tournament. The hotel and rooms need updating. The furnishings were pretty beat up but the beds were comfortable. There is lots of parking and is easy to access. Across the street from a Wal-Mart. Our window looked out to a giant wall so there was no view whatsoever. The bowling alley and cinema are nice to have available though we didn't use them. The pool was small and confined - not an atmosphere where we wanted to spend anytime so we didn't. Food court was convenient - Panda Express, Baja Fresh and a couple others I can't recall. We didn't go the buffet but had a breakfast with our group at the cafe which was good. Didn't gamble.

I had a reservation for 3 nights for a "group rate" $90Fri&Sat/$50Sun. At the last minute we decided to go a day earlier but I couldn't change my group reservation so I made a separate reservation online for Thursday and got a better rate of I think $36. They combined my reservations at check-in so I didn't have to change rooms and check-in/out but they said they were still charging $50 security deposits to my credit card for both reservations ($100). Which I found annoying.

In addition to the rates above there is a daily $15 resort fee that includes free Wifi. When we go to log on Wifi it gives options to pay $5.99 or $12.99 for internet access (no free option!). I called the front desk and they told me to go ahead and select the $5.99 option and they would reverse the charges when I checked out. Well, I didn't like doing this because I felt like was agreeing to pay extra and we had to do it with every device (phones, tablets, laptop.....) every day - So I feared I was racking up a big bill in internet fees. BUT they did reverse all the wifi fees and it took a lot of clicking on the computer at check out to do it. I feel they should certainly tell you about this upon check in and change the way they do it - just give us a password!

The day before check out I noticed they had charged 2 amounts to my credit card totaling an amount in excess of my 4 day stay & the security deposits. I expected to see the security deposits but usually hotels don't charges your rooms until check-out and I was worried about those wifi charges so I went down to the front desk to resolve. The woman was on the phone trying to resolve a computer problem and would not hang up to give me her full attention. She assisted me sporatically when they put her on hold. She explained that my visa will be credited when I check out once they are sure there are no additional charges to the room. Well the amount was in excess of the room rates/taxes/fees and the security deposit so I'm still unclear how they arrived at that amount but at the check out the invoice came out right even though the credit to my visa took several days to go through. I wonder if would have been overcharged if I hadn't seen and brought the charges to their attention. This was a hassle and a little stressful to me. If we stay off-strip again, it won't be here.</p><br></body></html>
