<html><head><h3>Texas Station Gambling Hall and Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 4</h3></head><body><br>Better than anticipated<p>Was suppose to stay at the Sante Fe casino but was rerouted due to " water main break" and I can honestly say I enjoyed this place more. It seemed bigger with more and better bars and restaurants . The bartenders were friendly .
There also is another casino next door and also a Walmart within walking distance</p><br>Old fashioned casino<p>We only stayed for one night so we didn't spend much time there. The room was quiet, a typical holiday inn type room. Not fancy but also not all beat up either, certainly adequate and reasonablely priced. We had the breakfast buffet and it was very complete and tasty with fresh cooked eggs to order as well as a hundred other things as well. Service (drinks, cutlery,silverware) was very good and the staff was both friendly and helpful.</p><br>Value for the money<p>Easy check in. Staff was courteous and helpful. rooms were clean. Only complaints are the bed was hard, the front desk was a pretty long walk from the designated registration parking, and the tables in the pool area were dirty.

Lots to do. There is a movie theater, a bowling alley and several restaurants on site. For the low cost this is the place to stay when on business or in that area of town.</p><br>Off strip accomadation<p>Texas Station is a good bit off the strip about 20 minutes by car but the casino is a fair size clean and the staff very helpful we enjoyed the bingo. The room we had was on the top floor with a good view of the strip, rooms on the other side of the tower have a view of a wall !!! not good, but overall a clean good size room and we would be happy to stay there again
Room Tip: not on the ground floor and not on the wall side

Buffett. Bowling alley. Convenient parking with mobile security. Shockingly low-priced items at the gift shop. Friendly staff. Clean.
ON THE OTHER HAND......
The reception desk-not unlike the post office-has many check in stations but only 1 actual person working there. During the 10 days I was at the hotel, I never saw more than one employee working the counter no matter how many people where in line. And the check in process was slower than Christmas.
Since I was here for my employer (who paid the bill), I didn't get to see the actual price for the room, but was rather stunned to discover having internet access runs (for the 'basic plan') $9.99 PER NIGHT. Really? I also asked about getting a microwave in the room-which is standard equipment everywhere in th Western World-and they said 'no problem' Only a $15 charge....PER NIGHT. Mini Fridge? Same price. Really?

I bet the Motel 6 Guys are laughing right now.

And one more issue of annoyance: my reservation magically disappeared and I got tossed out 3 days early and am now in another hotel.</p><br>Don't bother with early check in<p>Requested early check in and arrived at 9 am, no rooms were ready. At 3pm they finally had a room ready, front desk could of asked housekeeping to clean a room for me since I asked for early check in but nooooooo. Front desk clerk says this is only a request but nothing on there website says any of this. I think it's just a ploy to get you to come into there casino and gamble for 6 hrs while your waiting. So far I regret this choice of hotels, we'll see what the room looks like.
Room Tip: stay away from elevators and pool area

Checking in was super easy, as a front desk person myself I know how frustrating it can be. I do recommend anyone who stays put a cash deposit on the room ($100) instead of letting them authorize your credit card for that amount (which can take up to 10 days to be returned to you). The buffet was delicious, both for breakfast and dinner. There's a ton of selections for food besides the buffet, which is nice. Checking out was a breeze, just be prepared to wait a few minutes if you have a cash deposit. Overall it was a great stay. We would definitely stay again.</p><br>Good Inexpensive place to stay<p>We stayed here for one week.

We were two couples visiting.

Good place to stay. Kind of inexpensive as compared to other hotels on the strip. We used to come here when we were tired and needed some rest. The hotel has its own casino. We did not try the food so cannot comment on that. The rooms were spacious and bathrooms were clean.

I would strongly recommend this hotel to all.
Room Tip: Stay here and rent a car to visit the strip. It will be cost effective.

From bowling arcade games down to gambling there is something for all. Its a short drive away from the strip but the traffic isn't that bad.</p><br>Overall Good Stay<p>Check in was fast, and friendly staff. Room was #402 next to Ice and Elevator. It is a non smoking room with double bed although reservation was made for King bed. This is not a problem for us. Carpet is in very new condition. Everything in working condition. The furniture showed some signs of wear. The view is facing car park. The toilet flusher makes huge noise when flushing. The Ice maker on and off makes noise and is noticeable at night. Excellent lunch buffet with many selection dishes and a good crowd during the two days we were there. We had one dinner buffet is about the same selection as lunch with a few more meat dishes but with only 1/3 seating filled. With so many dish selection, and not enough crowd, the food stays there for a while. We prefer the lunch buffet.
Room Tip: Away from Ice maker and elevator
