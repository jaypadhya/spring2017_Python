<html><head><h3>Texas Station Gambling Hall and Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 15</h3></head><body><br>Love, love, love Texas Station!<p>I had an excellent experience at Texas Station. Check-in was a breeze, staff were very accomodating and helpful. My room and bathroom were huge and clean! The casino and the many amenities were top notch. Would not hesitate to recommend to anyone!</p><br>Great time as always!<p>Texas Station is our "go to" hotel when in Vegas. The staff is always wonderful and the prices are tough to beat. All in 1 stop with movie theater, bowling, food court, quality buffet, Starbucks, cafe with old school vegas specials, casino and sports book, easy parking and easy freeway access plus great location to city soccer mega complexes. Main downside is that if you are looking for the full Vegas experience, you are a little ways from Downtown and the Strip. Also, when it comes to hanging out at the pool, this is more like staying at a Best Western, but it is always clean and plenty of chairs.</p><br>Girlfriends Reunion at Texas Station<p>I stayed at Texas Station March11-13. 2012. My friend and I had not been to Vegas together for 20 years and Texas Station suited us very well. We made our reservation with the hotel at stationcasinos.com. For less than $50.00/night inclusive we had a double queen room located just off the casino floor. Our room was spotless and in good repair. We had room to spread out and I like that in a hotel room. It smelled clean. Luxury suites are availabe if that is your style. The mattresses were wonderful. The toiletries were blood orange scented and were great for a little aroma therapy boost. Water pressure and temperature in the tub/shower combo were ideal. It was convenient not having to walk to the north forty to get to our room. The ice and soda machines were right outside our door. We were not bothered by noise either from the hallway or the casino. Our room view was the parking structure so we closed the drapes. We did not take this trip for the room view. Starbucks was convenient to our room and was a lifesaver since we did not have in-room coffee. If you must have an eye opener before you face the day bring your own travel coffee pot. The buffet and 24 hour restaurant were well priced, clean, and inviting. We had great service and the food was above par. The casino was generous, large, and offered machines in every denomination. You will find the usual table games and roulette as one would find in any Strip casino. Cocktail/beverage service was spot on no matter what time of day or night. The casino was easy to navigate. I need landmarks to find my way in a new casino and I never got lost like I did in Harrah's and MGM Grand on the Strip. Security and safety are important to me and the Texas Station met my needs. I always felt safe in the casino as uniformed officers are on patrol throughout. We stayed without incident. The entire experience was perfect for our needs. We had a car and getting to the Strip and Freemont Street was easy using the freeway. As an added bonus there is another Station Casino right across the avenue! Be sure to obtain a Boarding Pass slot card. You will get dining discounts immediately. I earned two comp nights at any Station Casino in the few days I was there.
Room Tip: Book directly with Station Casinos. You will demonstrate interest in the property right from the st...

You don't stay here on a honeymoon, vacation with the kids, and don't even think about recommending it to your friends from Taiwan. I like this humongous property for it's wide selection of slots, low-stake table games, uncrowded casino, and good Player's Club benefits. Just don't take midnight strolls around the neighborhood and enjoy what you're in Vegas for!</p><br>Nothing fancy but nice, clean economy lodging<p>Station Casino/hotels are known by the locals to be nothing fancy but nice and clean. And this is what I found this place to be. I was not on vacation and traveling alone, so I wasn't looking for the Luxor. It definitely wasn't on the strip and actually was in a less reputable area but I did not feel unsafe. I liked having restaurants and a food court right in the hotel. I enjoyed the breakfast buffet. $4.99 with the "bording pass" they give you when you check in. There was also a movie theater and bowling alley. The pool looked nice, but it was outdoor and it was a bit cold for me to go swimming. I got a paper on my door every morning. There is a resort fee, but with the base price I paid plus the resort fee (I was aware of the resort fee and added them together in my head before I booked) I still got a good deal. I'd stay in a Station property again.</p><br>GHETTO!<p>1/27/2012. We are staying here because my high school age daughter has a gymnastics meet here tomorrow. BEWARE, this place is plain dangerous for women. My wife and two daughters were harassed in the elevators and the halls EVERY time they went outside the room. There are hoodlums everywhere. It’s like a gangsta den. The parking lot too. On top of that, they are charging us $89 per night when we can stay on the strip for half that! Front desk didn’t do anything to help other than call security, who fortunately agreed to walk them to our room. We shouldn’t have to call security just to walk from our room to the restaurant and back. We are leaving first thing in the morning.

If I was on a guys trip, it wouldn’t be so bad. Room 429 is quiet and reasonably clean. It certainly isn't worth spending more on this place than any other bunk you can find in town. It is definitely very low end, and attracts bottom feeders.</p><br>OK place , not much of a neighborhood<p>The hotel is fair,rooms ok...casino has low limit games and plenty of FREE 2nd. smoke.The buffet is OK,also has a bowling ally and movie theater.But the area is not for walking around and sightseeing.it is a very low rent district in North Las vegas,if u want sights to see and things to do then stay on the strip.If cheap gaming and a cheap room is what u want,stay on Fremont st.There is really no reason to stay here other than the need to be in this area for some reason.</p><br>Reservation desk was not good experience<p>Called to Texas Station for a one night reservation 4 days before our trip. They said they were full. Hotel One popped up with a room at Texass Station, so we booked and paid with Visa. Check out at Texas Station added $15.00 for a booking fee in a hotel that told us no rooms were availabe. Very unreasonable price for one night at this faucility NEVER AGAIN will this happen. We came for a large convention--inconvenient location for visitors.
Room Tip: Only stayed one night thank goodness
See more room tips</p><br>never again<p>Going to Vegas? Don't stay at the Texas Station. It's not that it is some distance from the strip, which it is. It's just a terrible place to stay. It's hard to believe that the people who bring you Red Rocks and Green Valley Ranch can sink so low. Upon check in the sewer stench in front made me really happy for the smoke filled air of the casino. It's been a week since my return and my throat still hurts. The resort fee is a real joke. I only used it for the internet one day. Easy to use but it cost me $30 for that. The Motel 6 style pool did not appeal to me and never did see a fitness center. I was informed that I had an upgraded room. can't figure out what that meant really except that I got a Hershey bar and Oreos each night. The linens were clean, thank goodness but the exposed box springs were a real turn off. I appreciated the security since I went to the strip each evening and got back late. Normally I gamble where I stay but the casino was a real disappointment. I've read the other reviews which is why I agreed to go there in the first place. Needless to say I won't take vacations with any of you. I guess my expectations run a little higher.</p><br>Nice large room, far from strip<p>Texas Station is a nice place to stay if you want to get away from the hustle and bustle of the strip. This is a locals casino; however, I thought the room were very nice for the price.</p><br></body></html>
