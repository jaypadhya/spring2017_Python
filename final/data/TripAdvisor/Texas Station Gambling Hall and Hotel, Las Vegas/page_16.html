<html><head><h3>Texas Station Gambling Hall and Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 16</h3></head><body><br>Very nice hotel if you want to avoid the strip.<p>Stayed here for a dart tournament I was working. in fact this will be the 3rd year in a row. I have always enjoyed the stay here. The room is always clean and well kept. AC is nice a cold. And housekeeping is top notch.

The only downfall is the distance from the strip but that is also a good thing as well.
And the pool is REAL small.


The food in the casino is great! from the buffet, to the Oyster bar, to the Steak House. The steak house is a bit pricey...but THE BEST ceasar salad you will EVER taste!

Look forward to my stay next year.</p><br>Loved this hotel and will be back<p>I found an amazing deal for this place and a friend and I decided to try it out. I am so glad we did! Normally I stay on the strip in Vegas but I am glad I tried something new. It was nice to have a little distance from the hustle and bustle of the strip.

Texas Station had everything I could have asked for. Free parking lot. A great casino that didn't leave me reeking of smoke. The rooms were good. All is really care about is cleanliness and i got that here. The decor in the room wasn't anything exciting but it was clean and comfy.

I loved the variety of activities I could do here. There is a movie theater showing several movies (I think there are like 10 theaters or something). And they have a huge bowling alley there, open 24 hours! I went bowling at 3am and it was so much fun.

This place offers different things than other hotels and it was a welcome change.</p><br>Unexpected surprise<p>My family went camping in a mountain range 40 miles Northwest of Las Vegas so after 3 nights of roughing it we planned on spending a night at a hotel in Vegas to clean up. After going dow to the strip and finding Circus Circus and the Riviera packed with long lines of tour bus people waiting to check in, being laughed out of Ceasar's Palace for expecting a room to be available as walk-ins, we remembered passing Texas Station about 5 minutes before we reached the strip. What a deal! Great room, excellent buffet for all meals, theater for the kids, arcade, mall-like food court, several nice restaurants, bowling alley oh yeah and a casino. My family was pleasantly surprised.
Room Tip: We had a room that seemed to be under the casino but we did not hear any outside noise.
See more room tips</p><br>This is an AWFUL hotel do not stay here<p>I usually write positive reviews, and usually let the bad one drop. Just the way I am.. But this hotel has become so awful, that it is important, I believe, to let everyone know, and I felt compelled to write. I will try to be fair as I describe the hotel On the plus side, the rooms were very cheap, and there was availability during a very busy weekend when other hotels in the area were full. That should have been a red flag, however.

The major problem is the noise and ambience of the hotel part. While the casino is huge, and the who facility is equally large (includes a small convention center, lots of restaurants), the hotel part is very small, just five floors. The rooms, by Vegas standards, are sub par. They are small, about the size of a Red Roof Inn, and in fact that is what they feel like. The rooms, while kept clean by the staff, are old, dingy, with torn wall paper, old carpets, no closet, but an open hanger area with hangers that can;t be removed (because, I guess, they expect their guests to steal the hangers). The bathroom is spartan. The TV is an old, analogue, 27" with few channels. There IS internet connection, and it is "free" (it is tacked on as one of the perkis to the $13 a night "resort fee" which you have no choice but to pay, but at least you get the internet as part of the deal.... SO I can write this bad review from THEIR internet!).

The biggest problem is the noise. This is one of the noisiest hotels I have stayed in. The rooms walls are paper thin, so you can hear the tv in the next room, even when your neighbor has it on low. One half of the rooms are over the pool area, and last night there were no less than 20 teenagers screaming and shouting an pushing their friends in the water, past midnight, although the pool was officially closed. ANY noise outside the door seems to blast into the room. And people in las vegas, you know are, well , ah, often well-imbibed, and all night long I was awakened to loud talking as people went down the hall. So, have of the problem is incredibly cheap rooms with no sound cushioning at all.

But the second half of the problem is that, for some reason, this hotel seems to be attracting large, loud families, with screaming kids, inconsiderate teens, and equally loud and inconsiderate parents. There is a real low-class feel to the place (and trust me, I am the LEAST snobby person in the world) --- I honestly did not feel safe most of the time, mostly because of this aggressiveness that permeated the place. No other way to describe it.

In terms of the food, I only had breakfast at the "Feast" Buffet, and that was enough to decide not not eat any other meals there. It was, by far the worst buffet experience I have had in Las Vegas in 30 years of coming her. Honestly. No hyperbole. The worst. There was very little selection --- about the same level as a very good Hampton Inn. Although the buffet is standard size, with lots of areas that are obviously used for later meals, at breakfast, just two small areas have the food... SO, everyone, and that is a lot of people, were crowded into one small area, most of them waiting for the one lone cook to make eggs. Really, it was both pathetic and frustrating, and while it WAS cheap, for a couple of dollars more you can go to any other buffet and have a REAL feast. Really, their food service manager should not keep his or her job, it is an embarrassment.

So between the horrible rooms, the incredible noise, the rough atmosphere, and the awful food, you have one of the worst hotel experiences possible in Vegas. And you know, there is such a glut of rooms in the city, that you can easily find, for a few dollars more a night, a fabulous resort with the opposite of all of my complaints.

Never again. And you should not either.
Room Tip: Yes, go to another hotel....
See more room tips</p><br>Not bad but I'll find another place next time.<p>It's funny reading the reviews after my visit. The front desk lady was pleasant and explained the $14 service fee but gave a credit back so it was $5.59 / day. Most Vegas hotels are doing it now. The first thing you will notice is the bad smoke smell. Ventilation system is not even close to the newer hotels / casinos. Booked here to be close to some events. It is out of the way and not in the best part of town. Let's just say it's not the most integrated neighborhood if you know what I mean. Lots of locals there for weddings and high school graduation ceremonies that cleared out at night. They were all very well dressed and we never felt these folks were gangsters or anything like that. We did like the convenience of the restaurants, bowling, bars, and starbucks all being close by and the parking was easy. Had breakfast at the buffet once and it was so so. They had an omelet guy but the line was too long. The pancakces and waffles were cold and hard. Next time we'll stay somewhere more convenient with better air quality.</p><br>Stay every month<p>For the price this is a wonderful experience. We go to the Drs. every month and we stay at Texas Station. The rooms are clean, bright and so far quiet. (Just don't get room next to elevator). We have used "My Vacation" which saved us money and just signing our check and not worrying about having cash on us.

The extra restaurants and theaters are great to have on hand after a long day of doctor appts.

I would recommend Texas Station to anyone who wants to avoid the hassle of the downtown and the strip.
Room Tip: Call and place your reservation on the phone.
See more room tips</p><br>A dark corner of Las Vegas but not that bad<p>We stayed at Texas Station for three nights as part of a reunion deal. This location had been selected for affordability. The rooms are average to below average, but cheap rates. The gambling is so-so. There are the usual amenities, with lots of places to eat to choose from. The staff seemed nice, but I understand they have a very high turnover rate.
I would give the buffet there a very high mark. Of all the things I experienced there (as far as the hotel goes), the buffet was the best. The food was excellent by buffet standards, and I went several times, a record for me. I typically do not like buffets.
If you are looking to experince Las Vegas, this is NOT the place to go. This is a locals hangout, and far from the Strip. Shuttle service does not go here, and a cab fare can easily catch you $50 one way from McCarran International Airport, and $20-$25 one way to the Strip. These prices will quickly overrun any cost saving factors trying to avoid the big Vegas Strip hotels. For cost effectiveness, I would look at downtown hotels or less trendy Strip hotels like the Stratosphere or Imperial Palace.</p><br>This place is the worst!<p>We had booked this hotel for a soccer tourney and I had read the prior reveiws but had remained open minded. But the second you arrive at this place the overwhelming smoke hits you as they have poor venilation. The front staff was only luke warm and first room they gave us had view of dirty service roof, we asked to be moved which they did only to have the next room be stained, out dated, and the blanket on the bed had been ripped and hand repaired. Just overall bad and old. We left within 2 hours and found another hotel. This place is in a bad area and the kind of people who were in a nd around were not family friendly.</p><br>Clip joint, unless you like $15/night surprises<p>I booked a room at this hotel-casino online for four nights and paid $76 up front, sight-unseen, to Vegas View reservation service. I suppose I shouldn't have been so naive as to believe that there are any true bargains left in the world, but the $16/night room rate advertised by Vegas View was too good to turn down. I wish I would have read the reviews at this site before I plunked my money down. I

arrived later than I had hoped because the place is hard to access by bus from the airport. When I got there, the girl at the front desk laid the $15/night surcharge on me--something I had clearly been influenced to believe was optional--not mandatory. Nothing like this has happened to me since I was in Mexico City ten years ago, and the Mariachi club wouldn't let me OUT without paying a totally unadvertised surcharge. Here, at this joint, they won't let you IN--once they have your up-front--without socking you the surcharge. I managed to salvage the rest of my four-night stay in Vegas by falling back on a place that has a deal more credibility. My guess is that this outfit is in desperate straits and has resorted to clipping their customers as their last option.

Not for this lad. I'd rather kiss my $76 up-front down the hole than knuckle under to this kind of rigged nonsense. Nevada Better Business Bureau--you'll hear from me about this clip joint.</p><br>Its a decent hotel off strip.<p>I stayed at this hotel with my wife and mother. We selected this hotel because of its close proximity to my in laws homes. It wasn't a typical fun trip to Vegas because of the passing of my father-in-law. So we stayed off strip for that reason as well. The hotel has quite a few amenities. A kids fun zone, eateries such as Panda Express, Fatburger, Coco's, and a Starbucks. There is also a movie theatre. The casino never seemed full except for the few locals that would frequent there. My only gripe, even though it may be minor, is that our room never saw a cleaning lady. We are not overly messy, we don't even get under the covers, however we did not receive clean towels. I had to call housekeeping to get some more. Like I said, nothing to major. I would not mind staying at this hotel again, but ultimately whenever my wife and I go to Las Vegas, we stay on the strip. The price was reasonable and I would only recommend this hotel to a friend who wanted to be off the strip and have decent amenities at a reasonable price.</p><br></body></html>
