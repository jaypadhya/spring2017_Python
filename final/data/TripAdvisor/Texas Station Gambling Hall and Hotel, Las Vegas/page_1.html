<html><head><h3>Texas Station Gambling Hall and Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 1</h3></head><body><br>Average 2 star hotel<p>The housekeeping crew was awesome. The rooms were of high 2 star caliber. At lease the beds were comfortable and it was easy to park near the hotel. Unfortunately, I did not try the buffet. The casino had some interesting employees. There was a floor manager at the craps table who got on me for not hitting the wall one out of 35 rolls. Then the next guy was an old man who barely got his rolls past the middle of the table. He never received the wrath of Matthew.</p><br>A Mormon staying at Texas Station<p>I came to Texas Station because it was close to North Las Vegas Airport, where I am receiving pilot training. It's not really that close to any normal Vegas touristy things. Which is a good thing to me, but probably not for others.

Pros:
1. The buffet (B/L/D) is cheaper than a value meal at McDonalds! And while it's nothing fancy, they have good variety and helpful servers.
2. 18 theater Regal cinema. My MMM (mormon married man) nightlife consisted of movies. Used up all my costco regal tickets.
3. Right Next to the Wal-mart. For all those little things you forgot to pack.
4. Everybody is really friendly and helpful. I'm sure customer service is important when your off the strip
5. Free WIFI (at reduced speeds)
6. Security everywhere. This is not a druggie or hooker casino. Or at least...not anymore? It may have been in the past hence the security guys every 20 yards.
7. The price! Yes they have the pesky resort fee. So does every other vegas hotel. Still a bargain in comparison.

Cons:
1. The shower.....Bring your own wrench and shower head. Great water pressure filling the tub. As soon as you divert it to the shower......just a trickle. Okay maybe better than a trickle. But not much. I know it the desert, and they are saving water....but I'm a grown man, and would like to shower properly. Don't bother changing rooms over this. They are all the same.
2. Paid Higher speed WIFI. (But still have the slower free WIFI)
3. This is kind of a Pro and a Con. The rooms are decent. The beds are okay. Pillows are okay. It's better than a Motel 6. Not as good as a Courtyard. In the Comfort Inn range. Little things....tear in the wallpaper....veneer coming off the door.
4. Did I mention the shower!?

Conclusion:

It's not the place for a swanky stay in Vegas. Seriously....don't expect a microwave, fridge, and spa for $30 night. ($45 with the resort fee) But for the price, it's pretty Darn good.</p><br>Stay away from Room 101<p>This room is under a storage room. When nobody is in there everything is fine. However when they decide to work in the storage room, Room 101 is very noisy. It sounds like someone is pacing the room wearing tap shoes or bouncing a golf ball. Of course they do this in the middle of the night. This is the second time I have been assigned this room. The first time they decided to buff the floor all night long. There is absolutely no reason why
they should have a storage room above a guest room.

When checking in I asked if I could have a different room because of prior problem and they said it was the only room they had. When I told them of the problem they acted like they had never heard of anything like that happening.

Room 101 is also across the hall from the ice machine which is very noisy in addition to hearing all the traffic getting on and off the elevator.

We were told that housekeeping starts to work at 9:00 am. I'm not really sure why they knocked on our door at 8:20 to clean the room.</p><br>Not a place to go<p>The room was "dumpy" at best. No desk, microwave or fridge. The bed was lumpy and the room smelled of heavy chemicals. I had a "non-smoking" room but the whole place smelled like an ashtray anyways. We were on the 4th floor and my daughter opened the drapes only to have a view of a blank wall outside our window.... I guess that is what you get for a Las Vegas casino.

The caf√© was HORRIBLE!!! DO NOT EAT THERE!!! When I ordered the Chicken Parm sandwich, it was like eating cardboard. No taste at all and was hard as a rock. When I complained and sent it back, they had the audacity to come back and say "we will only charge you for half of it". Can you believe that?!?!?! I told them no way that I was going to pay for ANY of it. They finally reluctantly took it off the bill, but didn't offer me anything else.

Unless you are a smoker who doesn't care about where you sleep and just wants to gamble, I would not recommend it.
Room Tip: Do not go here unless you don't care about your accommodations

Room was a good size, clean and tidy.
I found the staff to be friendly and helpfull.
The best thing for me about this hotel were the onsite amenities, I didn't need to leave the site at all, plenty of good restaurants, cinema, bars, bowling alley and of course the casinos.
The buffet restaurant is excellent value for money and the food is very good (if there was one of these near me in th UK I would eat there every day).
To sum up my stay, room was good, enjoyed the entertainment and it was amazing value for money.
Hope to be back soon!</p><br>Great rate<p>Not downtown or on the strip but that was OK for us. the room was clean, spacious and comfortable. We were passing through on the way to Utah National Parks and didn't need the strip. Close enough to Freemont and the strip. Nice pool area and covered parking. I don't see how you can beat this hotel.</p><br>Average Hotel and Casino <p>Reserved a king room at Texas Station because it was the location of a conference. The hotel is in North Las Vegas. The car driver said this area is the bad part of town and the casino attracts locals and undesirable people. I haven't seen that yet. It is a distance from Downtown and even further than the strip. Upon check in, they told me they only had smoking rooms, I don't smoke. If you are looking for a nice place, this is not the place. I wouldn't come back.</p><br>great time<p>the beds were comfy....very friendly staff....would have liked a cheaper rate....huge casino with plenty of good food choices....will go again for sure......rooms have nice views, nice beds, nice bathrooms....was hard to find valet parking and one thing we were very disappointed with..they do not have bellhops.....we have to carry our own luggage.......and valet is not near registration....so there is another long walk...not handicapp friendly .....i like having bellhops assist me especailly since i am handicap.....but still a nice hotel...can use some improvements....and discounted rooms..especially since its off the strip...not rate friendly.....




Room Tip: they have comfy beds and great view of vegas...bought us extra towels and pillows...very friendly st...

Room Tip: Ground floor rooms on the corner near the elevator ice machine very noise.
See more room tips</p><br>affordable and lots of amenities<p>had a basic 2 queen room, it was clean and quiet with a comfortable bed. hotel staff was friendly and helpful. the place has a large casino with tables, 2-3 bars, 4-5 restaurants (buffet is a good deal ie lunch for 7.99 with players card.... non-alcoholic bevs included), has a bingo hall, a theatre, a bowling alley ....
drawback - you would need wheels - is about 10kms from strip. also we didn't have any issues but apparently not in a great neighbourhood. so like being a visitor anywhere, keep your head up.</p><br></body></html>
