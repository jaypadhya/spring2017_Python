<html><head><h3>Texas Station Gambling Hall and Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 18</h3></head><body><br>Incompetent! But not a surprise<p>Booked a room at Texas Station because we were attending a "stay and play" soccer tournament in Vegas. Made a reservation about a month in advance and was told could not confirm two rooms adjacent for our family of 6 (2 adults, 4 young children). But, I could call the morning of check-in and do so. Of course, was told the morning of check-in that was not possible. Surprise! When checking in at 7PM we were 'lucky' to get two rooms on the same floor.
How it is not possible to make that simple (it would seem) arrangement is beyond me.
It's not like a 3rd rate establishment should be doing a little extra to compete for travelers.
The rooms are similar to what you would find in a hotel 20 years ago. The casino is bland and sad. There is nothing interesting within walking distance. Ok for anyone without kids thats likes to stay up all night pushing buttons and smoking.</p><br>Really Inexpensive: Fair/Okay<p>I just wanted to reiterate what others have stated here. I was looking for an inexpensive place to stay in Las Vegas, while visiting friends and seeing some desert sights. Got this on Priceline. It was a good deal for the $25 per night (plus the nasty EXTRA $15 per night charge). But don't expect a real clean place for this price. If you are not into gambling, it has a multiplex. It's right by Wal-Mart and other shopping and eats. It's easy to get around from there. It's also right next to another Casino/Hotel/Complex. Again, $15 EXTRA charge is nasty, but staying here for TWO nights for a total of about $80 was great.</p><br>Not so good, not so bad<p>On our trip to Vegas we stayed for a few days in this hotel/casino. The location of this hotel is off-strip, and of course you need a car to get around. The room was okay (free safe-locker) and the bathroom (lots of soaps/shampoo) was spacious. The pool is very small, on the other hand the casino is really big! I'm not really positive, but can't mention the downsides. The roomrates are really low (only in the weekends they go up). An okay place to stay for a few bucks and a few days.</p><br>How does $15 in resort fees go with a $25 room rate sound???<p>After booking this hotel on Priceline - when I showed up to check in they hit me with a $15 per night resort fee. Resort fee gave me the privilege of local and toll free calls and the use of the most horrendously slow internet I have ever experienced.

There is nothing else to say about this hotel - you advertise rates that are in line with off strip location hotels in Vegas - 3 stars and then pull the back door trick of a resort fee when your hotel is not even close to offering anything that gives value for this fees. Shame on Texas Station - Avoid this hotel!!!</p><br>Smoky, Run Down and Located in Unsafe Area<p>The hotel is located in a very run down bad area in North Las Vegas. I felt very unsafe. Smoke is very bad in the casino area on busy nights. The hotel seems to attract all of the low life people in North Las Vegas. Buffet was about a 3 on a scale of 10. Internet service for computers in your room was not stable. Be prepared to be charged a $14.00 service fee on top of the room rate. The service fee is for the internet and news paper. Room rates are cheaper than other hotels in Vegas.</p><br>OK, but there are better values out there.<p>If you need to be in North Las Vegas, Texas Station has clean comfortable rooms and many amenities. Pluses: Clean comfortable rooms, movie theater, bowling alley, food court, steakhouse. Minuses: Long walks, no bell service, no room service, flaky internet connection, few TV channels, overpriced for what it is. A "resort fee" is added to your bill, but by no stretch of the imagination is this place a "resort." My rate was supposed to be pre-negotiated with my company but the actual rates and fees charged varied from day to day for no apparent reason. You can get better deals than this, and unless you really need to be in North Las Vegas there's no reason to stay here.</p><br>I'd rather stay in Sing Sing<p>Filthy room, crummy service, charges added to my credit card without my permission, A/C from the 1950s.
Anywhere but here, please....
The Steakhouse was great. But slay elsewhere.</p><br>Good Value for Your Money<p>We have stayed here before and will likely stay here again. It is off the strip and away from downtown. The check-in was prompt and friendly. Our room and the bathroom were basic, clean and large. Since we were visiting family, we only stayed for 1 night.</p><br>Very Pleased with room..Nice Clean Large room<p>We stayed at Texas Station for 12 nights and we were pleasantly surprised with the room. The room was HUGE and very clean. The bed was comfortable and I called for extra pillows and housekeeping brought them up right away. The bathroom was large and had oval tub and lots of hot water and good water pressure. They had everything you need in room. A safe for your valuables, iron and ironing board, hair dryer, shampoo etc. Maid service did a great job keeping our room very clean. The pool is nothing special just a basic pool with towels provided and music by the pool. There is a cardio room with several machines with tv. The casino is huge and we did well on the slots. I loved the bingo hall ( I think it is your best chance for a win) The buffet was not very good except seafood night was good with crab legs and the cafe was good. we ate there several times. My husband went to the movies there inside the casino and said the threater was nice. There is a food court and bowling alley there too. The only thing we did not like was they add a resort fee of $12.95 per day onto your rate. They don't bother to tell you what it is for. I asked and they say it is for high speed internet, line passes at restaurants, free newspaper with coupons for the hotel. I never saw anything worth the extra $12. Other than this, we enjoyed the stay and was pleased</p><br>pass this over...<p>My first trip to vegas...
stayed at texas station due to a decent sale...

positives
decent room

negatives
room provided smelled of smoke - but they issued a new one trouble free...
surprised me with an 15$ a day service fee
buffet was low quality
sketchy patrons
location is really in the middle of nowhere (vegas suburb requiring a hefty drive to the action on the strip)

Next time, i;ll be staying on the strip</p><br></body></html>
