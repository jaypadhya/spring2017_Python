<html><head><h3>Texas Station Gambling Hall and Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 11</h3></head><body><br>Oh the elevator....<p>Everything was fine until it was time to sleep. Our room was near the hall where the elevators are located. The sound of the elevators going upo & down all night log kept us awake as well as the air turning on & off over & over again. Very little sleep....</p><br>Horrible Experience (See Photos) / Smoker's Paradise<p>Some may say "You get what you pay for!". In my stay at Texas Station, I got WAY less than what I paid for. My husband, 6-year-old son and I stayed a Saturday night at this hotel. My husband is active duty military, so we got a small discount. With taxes, our total for 1 night was $80.00. This room was worth no more than $25.00.

The entire casino is one of the smokiest I have ever been in. There seems like there is ZERO ventilation. We stayed on the 3rd floor which was an adjoining room. At 3AM I woke up to the smell of cigarettes, called the front desk to complain, and was told the only floor that allows smoking is the 6th floor. Well, the smoke probably drafted down through the air ducts, because our room SMELLED HORRIBLE.

This hotel is a Smoker's Paradise. If you'd rather not get 2nd hand lung cancer, I suggest you go nowhere near this place.

See photos for hideous vent in shower and craptastic furniture. AWFUL!!!!</p><br>Two Night Stay At Texas Station, North Las Vegas<p>I have stayed here a few times for business over the past 3 years. For the most part it is a good experience. Good buffet, and other dinning choices are in the hotel casino, and here are several bars also. The room was a bit uncomfortable due to the very noisy window air conditioner that sounded like it was about ready to take off. Annoying system of having to on the A/C by inserting your room key card into a slot inside the door. Good way to forget your card and lock yourself out.
Bathroom was clean with adequate towels, soap, etc. Lots of easy parking.
Room Tip: Easy access to casino and restuarants from rooms on the 2nd floor.

I should have demanded to be moved out of room 105 when we first checked in. There was a huge stain in front of the dresser and another huge stain in front of the night stand. It looked like the carpets hadn't been cleaned for a couple of years. The room also had NO ventilation, when you'd get out of the shower the room was so stuffy and muggy that the mirros wouldn't clear for about an hour. I even opened the window to try to get some air moving around. The room was simply nasty....but...we were there for a dart tournament and in between matches when we checked in so I just let it go. HUGE MISTAKE! The morning we were supposed to check out I felt something crawling in my ear. Of course I swatted at it and killed it. I went into the bathroom to see if I had something on my finger and sure enough there was what was left of a bug. I went back out and turned the light on, lifted the pillow and there were three more under the pillow! Pulled the covers down and noticed tiny blood streaks where we had touched them during the night! OMG...I wanted to throw up! They were literally crawling in the bed and on the walls behind the headboard! I gathered some of them up in a container and immediately went to the front desk. The manager of the hotel wasn't in so she called security and engineering to the front desk. The guy from engineering took one look behind the bed and said "Yup...I have no doubt...they're bed bugs". I went back upstairs and was waiting for someone to tell me what we were supposed to do from there. I looked at one of the security guards and the conversation went like this:
Me: So what are we supposed to do now?
SG: What do you mean what do you do now? Aren't you checking out today anyway?
Me: Yes, we're checking out today, but we didn't plan on checking out at 7 in the morning!
SG: Well..what do you want us to do?
Me: I don't know! Tell me what we do from here...how do I know we aren't taking those bugs home with us??
SG: Well..how do we know you didn't bring them with you? (Should have seen the look the hotel clerk gave him)...
Me: Are you freaking kidding me?? You were in the room when the engineering guy found them...they had set up camp long before we arrived!
I was so pissed off I wanted to slap him. Then come to find out that my boyfriend had spotted the blood streaks on the sheets the morning after we checked in and just thought he had cut himself or something and said that those streaks had been there since the first morning! Apparently they hadn't bothered to change the sheets for two days and apparently just made the beds!! EWWWW!!
The hotel manager called me back a few minutes later and told me that they would comp the room...okay..that's all fine and dandy except for one thing...the company I play darts for paid for my room, so I basically didn't get ANYTHING for my inconvenience and I told her that. She said "Well..that's all I'm allowed to do." I call [--] on that one. I know they could have at least comped me some slot play or some kind of dinner.
Needless to say, that will be the last time I stay at Texas Station and I posted it on Facebook so that all of the dart players were aware of the problem as well.
What is sad is the fact that before all of this I thought Texas Station was a very clean, nice hotel, but to be treated like this was MY fault...NOT A GOOD IDEA.

Me: Are you freaking kidding me??</p><br>Texas station<p>Pros:
1. Good food @ Austin's steakhouse
2. Friendly waiters @ Austin's & bartenders @ Cadillac bar
3. Plenty of self parking
4. Bathroom counter is big
5. Good sized bathtubs
6. Comfortable beds
7. Housekeeping fast service with more towels & pillows
8. Cheap rate
9. Comfortable chair in room

Cons:
1. Extremely rude casino valet guys
2. No valet for hotel side
3. No help with luggage from car to room
4. Not good tasting food @ Grand cafe
5. Not fast check in service
6. No fridges available
7. No book in room for hotel amenities or restaurants

I doubt if my boyfriend & I will ever return to Texas to stay. And I would not recommend it to anyone. If we hadn't pre-paid for the room, we would have left right after dealing with the rude valet guy. I do not understand how the first person you meet has that sort of a bad attitude. He should be the nicest & most helpful. It wasn't like he was busy, so no excuse.</p><br>Buffet Variety is Great; Smokey Atmosphere Diminishes Taste<p>I understand that all casinos in Vegas are filled with cigarette smoke. I don't like it, but apparently, I'm told that some of the best buffets are also in these smoke-filled slot machine joints. So I ventured to Texas Station on a friend's recommendation. The buffet has an amazing variety. Chinese, Mexican, American, BBQ and even breakfast food is served all day. The food is actually tasty and worth going back several times. The desserts are nothing to rave about, but you can fill up on food and not have to worry about dessert. It only cost was only $10 with a players card. The only issue I had was the smoke. Once it is in your clothes and in your nose, it takes away from your dining experience. We asked to be moved away from the main entrance, but they could not accommodate us because they were closing the back section. Overall, it was a pleasant experience, but if you want to go and can't stand the smoke, request a table in the back area -- hopefully, they will be able to accommodate you.</p><br>WORST HOTEL EVER<p>This is the first time I have ever written a review about a hotel, or anything for that matter. Maybe it's because I have a degree in hotel management... But any fool can see this place is absolutely horrible. I'm honestly not even sure where to start.

I stayed here in July for a convention that I go on annually with my grandmother and family. The hotel is about 20 minutes give or take from the strip -- first problem. (Location location location). Second problem is the lack of hotel provided transportation = taxis to anywhere if you don't have a car. 30 dollar taxi to the strip one way.

When I walked in my room there was a dirty towel on the dresser. First thing I saw. How do you miss that??????? Appalled. I'm not
exaggerating. Oh and the huge black hair on the shower wall leads me to believe they don't clean their tubs. Or showers. Or toilets.

My cousin couldn't get into his room for 3 nights because keys weren't working. Fridge is 11 dollars a night. Another guest staying with us was breast feeding so a fridge was a necessity. Usually a standard in most hotel rooms. Even the worst hotel rooms.

I could go on more but I will just say that I didn't choose this hotel. I was simply along for the ride to a convention. I don't understand how this hotel is still a functioning property. I suppose due to the casino that's inside. If costs $20 a night and I wouldn't stay here if someone paid me $20 a night. This hotel should either shut down or undergo a gut renovation which includes picking up and moving the property closer to civilization. Disgusting.</p><br>Not for me<p>I felt I was taken advantage of. My family and I, stayed at this hotel, because our daughter was having her dance competition there and in my opinion the hotel took advantage of this. Our charge for this room was 238.00 a night. For this amount, I could have stayed in a room in a fancy hotel on the strip. Ok, you gotta do what you have to do. So when we get there we have to track down someone to bring our luggage to our room and when we checked out I had to wait in line to get a cart so I could take my luggage back to my car because their was no one their on Sundays to do it. I stay there because I have to NOT because I want to.and one more thing they only have decaf coffee for the rooms, when I asked for regular coffee they said we haven't had that in quit sometime.</p><br>Simple Accommodations In Need of Updating<p>We've been all over the country for sports competitions. We're not fussy, we simply require clean, safe, and simple. This property meets those requirements.

The staff was incredibly friendly--whether it was at the Starbucks, or the Oyster Bar, or at hotel registration. We needed another blanket and extra towels, and the room staff took care of it quickly.

But the huge stain by the front door was a turn off, and the missing drawer pull was pretty sad. And I've never stayed in a hotel that didn't offer some kind of in room coffee maker and the notebook of hotel amenities so we could figure out where we were going or eating or what we could do. Also no paper and no pen in the room--not a single night.

The Internet is part of the 'resort fee' which is anywhere from $10-14, so see if you can get them to negotiate that. With no gym, no in room coffee, or water, I felt like I was paying $10 a day to do work from the room. I know all hotels charge these fees in Vegas and Reno, but please give us something for the fee.

The property has a movie theatre and a bowling center attached, so families who still bring kids with them to Vegas will find some things for them to do.

The A/C was very loud, but we turned up the thermostat at night so we wouldn't hear it cycle as much.

Know the hotel policy, because we were travelling with 4 people, but we needed three beds, and had planned on getting a rollaway. We were told they don't put rollaways in rooms with two beds. So plan on being ultra friendly with your group or bring an air mattress. Thank goodness we did.

It was super convenient to walk around a corner from the hotel room to the bowling center for the kids' tournament, and if they bowled here we'd stay again, but in terms of distance, try someplace like South Point instead for more amenities in the same price range (and same distance to the strip or downtown).
Room Tip: Make sure you ask for nonsmoking if you booked it that way. They seem to try to steer folks to smok...

We booked directly thru the Texas Station website and got the Bed & Breakfast special for $29 a night. It was my very first time in Vegas, so I was completely blown away at how over-the-top everything was. Most important was the fact that the entire facility is air-conditioned, which was a MAJOR plus. We drove to Vegas to pickup my nephew and bring him back to California for summer vacation, so we only stayed overnight - but we had a blast, nonetheless. The staff and security personnel were some of the friendliest people we've ever met, and we ended up in nearly hour-long conversations with every employee and patron we ran into, which was a pleasant departure from the nasty attitudes we deal with at home. Some people shared their life stories, others told about the circumstances that led them to Vegas, and there were a few people who just had funny anecdotes and words of advice - but all of them were a delight to meet and really left us with an overall sense of this establishment specializing in hospitality, friendliness and exceptional customer service. We had read some complaints about the neighborhood in which this hotel is situated, but we had no concerns or reservations whatsoever, and we felt completely safe. The setting is actually very similar to what you'd find at a suburban shopping mall.

It was such a pleasure to have an entire vacation resort in one building: food and dining, movie theater, bowling alley, children's play center, gambling, video game arcade, and much more. The interior design of the building is very reminiscent of a Disney theme park, and the entrances of all the restaurants and shops are made to look like movie sets. At any moment, you'd almost expect little singing animatronic figures to emerge from the windows. There are fountains, rivers, bridges, cement figures and all sorts of "theme park" style propaganda. It's amazing! The food was expensive, but our Fatburger and Sbarro Italian meals were among the very best we had ever had in our lives - much better than anything they make back home. Plus, they're not stingy like the restaurants back home, either, so we got a TON of food for our money. There was an abundance of seating, although the chairs were a bit low to the ground.

After we picked up the little one, we were a bit exhausted [from the long drive and the 100-plus degree heat], so we returned to our room for a short nap. Our deluxe double queen room far exceeded our expectations: the beds were comfortable, the linens were very clean, the bathroom was beautifully maintained, and the air conditioner - while it was quite loud - did keep our room nice and cool. In the evening, we took the youngster out for some kid-friendly fun. Unfortunately, we weren't aware that the Kids Quest facility requires the child's immunization records [which we would've appreciated knowing about ahead of time], so we took him to the video arcade instead. There was a decent variety of games for him to play, and we won enough tickets for him to buy a few little toys, so that made his night. After that, we enjoyed a few rounds of bowling, then bought a few pizzas and returned to the room for the night. There weren't very many TV channels to choose from, but we had enough portable electronics to keep us occupied. Once my mom and nephew were asleep, however, I ventured out to the casino floor for a few hours to play the penny slots. I must say that the entire casino floor was RANK with cigarette odor. It was nearly suffocating - even the empty machines had ash trays that smelled like smoke - so to anyone with asthma or breathing issues, DO NOT stay here!! But I got used to the smell after a while, and I ended up having a great time. They offer hundreds of games to play and almost all of them are penny-plays.

Overall, we were extraordinarily pleased with our experience and will not hesitate to stay here again. For a family or couple who don't want to shell out the money to stay on the strip, I highly recommend this hotel. Plus, they provide so many food and entertainment choices, you'd really never have to leave the building...unless you wanted to. Our only real complaints were about the Kids Quest requirement and the smoke odor, but we had a wonderful time otherwise. If you're used to staying at 4-star, luxury hotels, then this place will probably disappoint you - but if you're on a budget and are looking for a fun, family-friendly, comfortable place to stay, then you'll definitely enjoy the Texas Station!!
Room Tip: We specifically asked for a room on the ground floor, and were surprised to learn that it's actu...
