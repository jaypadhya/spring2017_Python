<html><head><h3>Texas Station Gambling Hall and Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 8</h3></head><body><br>Great value but casino is smoky<p>We booked two nonsmoking rooms with two queens in each for our family in July 2014. Price was great but doesn't include resort fee of about $15 per room per night. We requested that the rooms be adjacent or at least near. When we arrived, an unpleasant woman in the checkin desk told me that they had only one non smoking room with two queen beds. She didn't offer any alternatives other than one king smoking room. Fortunately, a helpful woman who at have been a night auditor was able to look into the situation and found two non smoking rooms with two queen beds and also gave us six free coupons for the buffet. The rooms were on different floors but that is pretty expected. The rooms were clean. The walk between the parking garage to the hotel elevator was unpleasant with a lot of smokers in the casino area and the smoke just lingers there. The buffet was better than most. Mashed potatoes, ham and bean soup and cheesy pizza bread were my
favorites.</p><br>Not even worth it!!!!<p>Check in was fast and they were very nice, but that's where it ended. One of our rooms had hair of both kinds on the floor in the bathroom. Other then that the room was satisfactory. I didn't read any reviews before booking this hotel so was unaware of the "Resort Fee" (would have been ok if we could have used the services) I tried to get online but it showed a fee of $5.99 so decided I would just use my data instead. At checkout unlike others I was charged $14.55 per room for resort fees we had 2 rooms. When asking about the resort fee when we checked out and that we didn'tknow we could use the internet Neisha at the front desk said we still had to pay anyway. My daughter and her family was in our second room and said they tried to access the internet (and was willing to pay the $5.99) but it wouldn't let them even get on. We did get the news paper for each room and it was the first time I've paid $29.10 for 2 newspapers (resort fee for both rooms). Would I stay here again? Not on your life! Not worth the price or confusion for something you don't get. Pretty much a rip off!! I will discourage everyone I know to stay elsewhere. They simply don't care about their quests!!!</p><br>Texas station not good representation of "Station" casinos<p>Booked room here because it was in north LV, just staying one night and wanted to avoid the hassle of LV strip, etc. Couldn't find valet parking (no where near the entrances), when I finally did the attendant wasn't overly friendly or helpful. In fact I had to take my bag out of the car. Valet parking is on the complete opposite end of the casino. Had to walk the entire casino to find check-in. BTW this was on a Wednesday. Two clerks behind the counter, but only one was checking people in.Said there was coffee/tea in the room, there wasn't. Room was ok but nothing special, a little dated and tired. Won't stay here again.</p><br>Buffet ok, room dismal<p>The staff is fine, I found the room clean but uncomfortable due to the loud AC which blew directly on me. Summer in Vegas means you have to run the AC. I knew it was a cheap room, but I would have been more comfortable sleeping in my car! The buffet was okay, the $2 margarita was barely drinkable. I don't gamble so I can't say if they have "loose" slots or not. The security guards are very helpful. The resort fee is a rip off! Terrible internet on the top floor. Parking is free. Maybe fall or spring when you don't need to the AC/heat would work ok.
Room Tip: You get what you pay for. I stayed at the Ballagio in April and certainly was expecting that type of...
See more room tips</p><br>Okay hotel for the price<p>This is a case of you get what you pay for. Room was about 50 a night plus resort fee. The $13 dollar resort fee meant I got free internet that they adveritise as it 5.99 when you sign up. Would be cheaper to just pay for internet instead of resort fee You just have to understand that this is not the Bellagio but you are also not paying those prices. Room was clean, smelled of smoke but most of Vegas does so you just accept that. Rooms were good size, not much in way of accomodations. Great hotel if you are visiting friends or relatives nearby. Not really a destination resort but lots of activities in the the casino area. Plenty of different food options and a movie theatre built into it. The side of the hotel I was on faced a giant wall, no view at all for any north facing room. For the money, I would stay their again.
Room Tip: Try to avoid a north facing room as you will have zero view.

The front desk clerks were extremely friendly and nice, the security guards near the elevators to the hotel rooms were very pleasant and helpful. The drink staff and wait staff were all very friendly and helpful as well. The only problems we encountered was extremely poor service by our waitress in the buffet on Sunday evening. I had to ask another waitress in a different section for our drinks since we were never waited on by our waitress. I called the "supervisor" over to complain about the service and it did not appear that anything was done about it, so I would make a point not to sit in the same area of the restaurant ever again.
Room Tip: I always ask for a room away from the vending and the elevators since that is where most of the nois...

And...there were a few gnats buzzing around on the TV dresser. (But we were on the Ground Floor)

Other than that, everything else was great! VERY FRIENDLY and professional staff...from housekeeping to security....ran in to a couple guys that worked in engineering and they gave a friendly "Good Morning" as I passed by.

I was impressed that my I.D. was checked for EVERY purchase I made with a credit card. So many places do NOT check I.D. So ...that was an added 'security' bonus!

We had dinner at the Grand Cafe in the hotel. ALL meals were under $10! Nice portions and tasty!! And.... breakfast is served day and night.
Pool hours are 7am - 9pm, but we were in there until about 9:30/9:45 and were never 'kicked out'.

All in all, it's a pretty nice place.
Rooms are clean.....kind of an 'old school' type hotel.
Casino is nice and clean...and there is an 'open feel' to the casino. Everything isn't all jam-packed together.

Oh....and I'm sure a lot of people will appreciate the fact that there is a Starbucks in the casino, too!!

"JUST" North of the Vegas strip.... it's worth a stay.
Room Tip: They "DO" have a ground floor. If the window would have been able to open, we could have...

Very clean and just a hop skip and jump to Casino and dining.
Room Tip: higher rooms have less noise from Casino and higher number rooms are further down the haa from eleva...
See more room tips</p><br>Terrible casino,,,stay away<p>There are about 10 station casinos in Las Vegas.
Nearest one from this one is Fiesta =only 30m north.
Texas is bigger but nothing good about this casino.

I visited almost all station casinos and this is the worst.
All the casino personnels are rude and lazy.
Food ( in buffet) is terrible. ( Steak house was good though==not too expensive ,,small restaurant but they serve really good steak with reasonable price.

If you go little further ( north ) on the same street you will find Santa fe Station casino==
This is one of the best Station casino=== workers are nicer and buffet food is great!</p><br>Very nice room, BR large, clean -<p>I had to check out of Santa Fe and move to Texas Station due to "booking" - as even though I have HIGH STATUS at both properties I could not extend my stay at their hotel due to the amt of rooms they allot to Hotwire, Expedia, etc-frustrating! But - between the 2 sister properties I preferred Texas Station rooms without a doubt. Updated HVAC system where it requires a room key placed in an electronic slot so you can regulate therefore reducing excess waste of power, friendly staff , security at the entrance to the hallways to the rooms was SUPERB; gambling was not that successful at this location. The worst part was I order a plain burger for my service dog and found a larva in it - but that was AFTER I had to FIND someone to take my order (10 min) as a boxing match was on, then was charged an extra $1 because I wanted it for "take out" (should be disclosed) as it is much less hassle than to have disgruntled customers who do not understand the Federal Laws about Service Animals - Santa Fe Station's Café is 100x better than Texas Station. You are charged a daily "resort fee" and then when you log onto your laptop you are again given an option of a $5.99/per day or $12.99/per day rate for the internet - I thought that was all included in the "resort fee" so I have yet to settle that issue out when I check out today BUT definitely needs to be clarified in house and either remove it from their internet log in site or tell travelers at the Front Desk when the check in about the double dipping. The BR is 4x the size as Santa Fe and BRIGHT - polar opposite to Santa Fe. The pool (no Hot Tub seen from outside the gate) is easily accessible from the rooms and plentiful parking, except for handicapped. I did see security on bike going through the parking garages so another bonus for this facility. Overall very happy once I figured out the right temperature, one degree made all the difference between HOT and FREEZING. Would definitely stay here again - I live local but at times with big projects it is easier to get away and hide to get them done than to be distracted at home - for the price it would be hard to go ANYWHERE else and I have traveled extensively and get what you get at Texas Station - I was VERY pleased except with the Café and the larva in my Burger. When my dog wouldn't eat - I knew to look down around and voila -that is what I found that turned her off - thank goodness!
Room Tip: I believe that all rooms are the same; just ask them to show you how to use the HVAC system. As the...
