<html><head><h3>Texas Station Gambling Hall and Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 19</h3></head><body><br>Worked out GREAT Clean room, Restaurant in same Building<p>Easy off Freeway, Clean, Quiet, Nice beds, Three restaurant good food</p><br>Dirty, and hidden fees!<p>Big room but uncomfortable bed. My pillows had footprints on them -- i guess the previous guests threw them on the dirty floor, walked all over them, then the housekeepers just put them right back up on my bed! tub was funky too, lots of little hairs left behind by other folks. So what? i was willing to put up with it all, because I got a very good deal on the room. but not so fast! at checkout, a $14 charge appeared on my bill. Apparently I had "agreed" to it when I signed in, even though it wasn't verbally disclosed, and since I had prepaid for the room, I wouldn't have had much of a choice anyhow. Desk staff couldn't care less that I was unhappy, or that I had received absolutely nothing for the $14 they charged me. It sure would be nice if hotel websites would disclose fees like this ahead of time. I mean, if everyone pays the same fee, then it's essentially part of the cost of the room, right? You don't go to a restaurant and pay $5 for a burger, then after you've paid, get told you must pay $5 more for it to be served to you! This is just as dishonest.
I could overlook the dirty room if the price had been rock-bottom cheap, and I could overlook the rip-off at the front desk if the room had truly been 3-star and luxurious. But this place loses out on both counts.
Also, if you eat at the Fatburger restaurant in the casino, keep an eye on your burger. The first one I ordered was red (rare!!) inside, and when I returned it, the second one was pink (even after the cook "made sure" it was cooked thoroughly). That's not safe.</p><br>Texas Station - too much smoke!<p>Las Vegas is great! But Texas Station is a "locals" casino. As a result, you have a lot of locals (read: gangs of kids wondering around the food court at night.) Security was good in the hotel, but the area around it was not great. The room was about what I expected - nothing great but OK. We got an "upgraded" room on the 5th floor - it had a small refrigerator and microwave. I was on a trip with kids to a gymnastics competition so no gambling - but the casino area looked nice for an off the strip location. The real problem for me was cigarette smoke! When I walked in the front door the smoke was overwhelming. My eyes hurt the entire time I was in the lobby/casino.</p><br>Terrific value!<p>Texas Station is simply a great stay in Las Vegas if you’re counting pennies. Although the complex sprawls in all directions, the hotel component is a modest and manageable 200 rooms. Self parking is right outside the door. Rooms are moderately spacious and functionally equipped. Don’t expect breathtaking views of the skyline or the mountains; most windows face adjacent walls, with just enough space to let in real light. My king bed was clean and comfortable, with four normal-sized pillows. A four-drawer dresser is provided, as is a round corner table on which you can eat, read, or compute. There’s a standard-issue TV and cheap clock radio, reliable wireless internet access, and an iron and full-size ironing board. The bathroom is large and clean, albeit somewhat Spartan. I would recommend bringing a bar of your favorite soap...the hotel bar looked fancy but had zero cleaning power.

I’ve stayed in most of the large Strip hotels, and by comparison, Texas Station is amazingly quiet; generally it’s not the kind of place where loud mooks and their drunk girlfriends carouse up and down the halls and party in their rooms at all hours of the night.

The casino spans a length of several city blocks; you could get a day’s exercise just walking its length five or six times. It’s spotless and comfy. The mostly-townie clientele is a mix of retirees and working class average Joes/Jills. A large percentage of the several-thousand slots are electronic models that allow you to play as little as a penny a spin, or up to $15 if you’re feeling flush and lucky. Although the table game area is relatively small, you’ll find most of your favorites, including an always-lively craps table with reasonable minimum (usually $5 days and weeknights). There’s also big poker room and a spacious bingo hall.

The casino floor is ringed with a number of in-house restaurants and fast-food chains (Starbucks, Fattburger, Baja Fresh, Panda Express, Dairy Queen). There’s 24 hour dining and room service from 6am-11 pm daily. A particular value is the Feast Buffet, with multiple cuisines and good quality; usually maxing out at $11.99 ($9.99 if you’re a guest), it’s one of the best buffet bargains in town.

Because it’s a family destination, there’s an entire section called Kid’s Quest, where you can park the under-12 year olds in their own snazzy daycare play/dining area. The complex also houses an 18-screen cinema and 60-lane bowling center.

Located in North Las Vegas, Texas Station is a ten-minute ride to the center of the Strip most times except commuter rush hours (I’m including some handy driving directions in a separate comment). Unless you plan on staying in the facility your entire trip, you’ll need a rental car.

There’s nothing flashy or glamorous about Texas Station. Facing increasing competition for local dollars and riding the downside of a shaky economy, they provide terrific value. The staff is friendly and helpful. If you’re in town for business or relaxation, have a car, and don’t need to impress associates or the girlfriend, I highly recommend it.

PS: Search for online bargains. My three-night stay cost a total of $115.90!</p><br>Vacation with Family<p>My wife and I stayed at the hotel from November 22 through November 26, 2008. The hotel was very nice and comfortable, actually, better than what we expected. Considering that we traveled during the Thanksgiving season, it was much colder (40 – 50 degrees) than what we expected for Vegas, I was shocked. The hotel is inexpensive, especially if you book one to two months in advance. We paid $200 for a 4night/5day stay (because we booked one month in advance) and we felt it was an excellent price. We had double beds for just the two of us.

The hotel was very pleasant and enjoyable but we did not have a chance to enjoy the pool. The hotel has several activities that will keep you busy, not to mention the slot machines on the main floor, a bingo hall, a pool and free parking. We especially enjoyed the all-you-can-eat buffet. I would not recommend eating it every day, but boy, was that food delicious. One tip, look for the coupon in the hotels newspaper, which provides a discounted rate of $6 for two people.

We had a wonderful stay and would consider returning. Since this was our first visit to Vegas, we decided to mix our hotel stay between the Texas Station and the Hilton. We remained in Vegas until December 3, 2008. There was so much to do and see but we did not get a chance to do it all. We expect to return in the immediate future of 2009. Please see the photos my wife took.</p><br>Discounted rate through Hotwire...<p>My wife and I drove down to North Las Vegas from Sparks, NV because of an employment interview and to also visit with some family in NW Las Vegas. I booked our stay at Texas Station through hotwire @ $30/night but a few hours later found a discount on orbitz @ $20/night at the same location so I submitted a "double the difference" claim. I'm still waiting to hear to back from hotwire.

Our stay was from 12/17 to 12/21...we arrived late Wednesday afternoon while the Las Vegas area was experiencing an unusual snow storm. There was only one clerk at the front desk addressing an issue with another guest. We waited and waited until the clerk concluded that she was going to be with her guest for a bit longer. She excused herself and went off to locate another clerk which took about 10 minutes before she came back with a colleague to help us. Check in was quick but there was no apology for the wait. The clerk did explain that there would be a $10.85 hotel/resort service fee per day. We were told that this would take care amenities i.e. wifi or in room safe.

We were assigned to a non smoking room 410 which was very clean, had a king size bed w/large bathroom, overlooked a small pool and parking garage. The house keeping service was great. They were in our room before 11am each day to tidy up.

The gaming floor area was pretty large and also contained a bowling center, movie theatres, food court, upscale steakhouse restaurant, buffet, cafe and Starbucks. Coupons for breakfast/lunch discounts at the buffet and cafe can be cut out of the daily newspaper that is delivered to your room.

All in all I found the Texas Station convenient and comfortable for the price that I paid. I would recommend that if you're from out of town, rent a car. This location is about 25 minutes away from the main strip.</p><br>OK, but couple of issues......<p>The hotel was OK, but make sure you ask for a room with a view! We had a lovely wall to look at! But we weren't in the room much. The hotel rates a general OK, it basic, but has everything you need, restaurants are good, plenty of bars etc. To say the locals love this place - there didn't seem many in there , the place lacked atmosphere. Luckily most of the time there was a bunch of our friends with us, but had we been there alone, it could have been a bit dull. It is quite a way from the Strip if you want to check that out during your stay, there are better hotels in the same price range nearer the strip.</p><br>Local's love this place<p>Stayed here back in January for business. Good location for my business. Nice place. Ordinary rooms at a fair price. I was told that the local's love this place. There is a lot to do with everything there. What else can I say.</p><br>Good restaurants a plus<p>My husband stayed here for business meetings and I joined him for a long weekend. Room was pretty basic, though the beds and pillows were comfortable. Bathroom in good condition except for slow-draining sink. There were only two, rather uncomfortable chairs in the room. A more comfortable chair would have been appreciated. The restaurants that we tried were good. The Italian restaurant, San Lorenzo, was very nice and had reasonable prices. We ate several times at the Texas Cafe, which had good prices and pretty good food. All wait staff was very pleasant, as was the front desk staff. Movie theater and bowling available on-site. Outdoor pool is small. Ample parking. Easy drive to the Las Vegas Strip.</p><br>Amazing Value<p>Our visit to Las Vegas was primarily to be with family members who reside in the North Las Vegas area so we decided this time to try something away from the strip and a little closer to them. This hotel, upon arrival, was a total surprise. For one thing, it is just about as large as the strip hotels, nothing like the small roadside property we had expected.
For once, the elevators and front desk were located near the front door. We are so accustomed to dragging our luggage through casinos to get to our room that this was a pleasant change.
We didn't have the opportunity to sample the food in the hotel but our only complaint would be the lack of a coffee maker in the room and the fact the only place to find coffee in the morning is a Starbucks on the property.
This was a tremendous bargain and we will be returning to this property annually. Easy to get to, plenty of free parking, nice location.... only about 4 miles from the strip.</p><br></body></html>
