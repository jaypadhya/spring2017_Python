<html><head><h3>Texas Station Gambling Hall and Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 3</h3></head><body><br>Unhappy<p>1) No Valet and relatively long walk to from desk from parking area 2) Credit card upfront so they can charge an extra $15 per day to make bed in addition to the pre-paid room 3)Teeny Tiny Pool, just large enough for 6 or so kids. Too small for adults 4) Lousy Food</p><br>Great "stay-cation" for locales.<p>Hotel just turned 20 years old. A "locales" casino. We use it for one of our favorite "stay-cation" locations as we live here. Cheap rates especially for locales who are members of the player's club through Stations Casinos. They have one of the best steak houses in Las Vegas, Austin's, we eat there often and have NEVER had anything but great food and excellent food at a fair price. You get what you pay for and we got it!
Room Tip: All rooms are either singles or double beds, hey do not have any suites.

Even though we had three people in our room, the front desk refused to allow us more than 4 small, scratchy bath towels per day. Our second day there, we were provided with no housekeeping service at all, because they said the hotel was full and they did not have time for us.
The bathrooms need to be updated, and the pool is small and unspectacular.

The front desk staff is rude and unhelpful. We loved the people in the gift shop, though.
Room Tip: If they won't give you bath towels, go to the pool and get some there. A housekeeper gave us t...

No traffic in the morning or evening on 95! The room was clean and relatively quiet; the AC blew super cold and water pressure was decent. The room completely suited our needs for the price. $60/nt
Wish I had a chance to try the buffets. I hear all the locals go there for breakfast.
The real downsides- was room could use brighter bulbs and the wifi signal was useless. You can read FB but god forbid you try to post something. Sending emails was spotty. The pool was teeny and filled all day. Hello, pretty obvious you need more pools or a bigger one.
Room Tip: Stayed in 413, Super easy access from parking to room. Very quiet and away from the elevators.

Had problem with safe-my fault- security came within 2 minutes to reset code-Excellent value!</p><br>Local's Casino<p>We went here on our last day of our trip to burn time before our red eye flight. We found they had a large movie theatre which was the reason for our attendance. Very large movie theatre. We went during the day so it was a ghost town and a little uneasy at first. After the movie we sat down for some $5 blackjack. We learned our lesson. These outskirt hotels are where the locals go to gamble and tourist are not as....welcomed. Half of the staff was friendly and very helpful, the banker was not as nice. She also catered to the locals telling us that we had to wait while another person cut in front of us to cash out. (not a big deal, its the principle) In my eyes, money is money and if we're spending it with you, then we're helping to keep you in a job. Customer service should be just that. "Customer" service.</p><br>Great For Families On A Budget<p>My son had been staying at this hotel with his family and wanted my wife and I to stay with them for 1 week. He said that it was family friendly with those on a budget in mind. The rooms are average although there is obvious wear and tear from heavy turnovers. Damaged bathroom wall tiles needed a good scrubbing. Rooms are losing their luster.
Some rooms smell of smoke, but this is Las Vegas. There are no coffee makers, microwaves or refrigerators in the rooms. This is a budget hotel and I have come to accept it for what it's worth. There is free parking offered in a separate structure,
a rather small swimming pool and cardio room. There is a bowling alley, a food court with several restaurants under one roof. There is a buffet which offers breakfast lunch and dinner at good prices. There is also a theater that offers movies for all ages. This establishment is Northwest of the "Strip" and a few blocks from the freeway. The rooms need a facelift, but are fairly clean. The staff is friendly and helpful. A great place for families who gamble that won't break them.</p><br>The worse stay ever<p>The rooms are small.the non smoking area smells like smoke. The pool is small and nasty will not stay there again. The only plus was the restaurant fat burger. ..it stayed open late. I wouldn't recommended anyone to stay there.</p><br>Large Rooms, Large Parking, Lots of Freebies, Great Food , Friendly Slot Machines.<p>The very, very playful and friendly slot machines at Texas Station Las Vegas, are going in tandem with the free night stay there. So - the cycle is repeating again and again : Lo-o-ong play for my dollar, and free stay with the complimentary room offer after the play. NICE!. A large, easy free parking; a crisp& fresh & large room; Texas style tasty and non-expensive eateries; pool. You get it all, if You play casino at Texas Station in Las Vegas. Did I mention the friendly Texans, who work there:)?
Thank You , Texas Station!
It was a pleasure to be & play with You!
Room Tip: Quiet rooms all ower
