Room Tip: need a car so you can get around.

The room was great. The casino has a movie theatre and a bowling alley. Great gaming and restaurants.

The pool is open early and stays open late.</p><br>Off the beaten path, but overall a nice casino.<p>This isn't the traditional Vegas Hotel. I stayed at Texas Station because of price and location. I hadn't planned much time for R&R. Texas Station was clean and comfortable. I was a bit surprised at the Resort Fee they charged, which was almost as much as the hotel room. This put a distaste in my mouth right off the bat, but realistically, it was still a reasonable price. The WiFi was a bit kludgy. When I logged in, I was asked if I want the basic speed for 1 price, or a faster connection for a higher price. A call to the front desk confirmed that WiFi was free, but I had to choose the cheaper option, and I was in fact, not charged.</p><br>Away from most other casinos<p>Stayed Jan 2013 and found the rooms clean and fresh. Two lights did not work when we entered, we told the maid and maintenance was there and had them fixed within minutes. Cool air seemed to be coming into the room beneath the AC/Heater and therefore the heater cycled on quit often. The casino is quit large and easily navigated. Several food options. We tried the Cafe and enjoyed it. We tried the buffet for breakfast and it was nothing outstanding but quit acceptable.
Room Tip: We were on the ground floor, therefore we were not waiting for the elevator.

The rooms are well appointed and things were clean enough but the walls were so thin that I could literally hear a man snoring in the next room. Security seems to be at an "overkill" level at this property. Even if the security people had seen you come and go from your room area three or four times they still had to ask to see your key. They must have had a lot of security issues in the past to implement this type of system. Buffet was the worst I think I have ever had in L.V.
Room Tip: Choose one somewhere else.

In addition, the 24 hour Hotel Coffee Shop was closed at 10 PM. Not a good experience at all.</p><br>Great family stay!<p>The Texas is off the beaten casino path, but great to stay if you have small children and want to visit friends and family. Rooms are clean and roomy. Fast check-in and very friendly staff. Having a movie theater, food court, and Starbucks was terrific. Easy access to the mall and downtown. Didn't use the pool, however, it looked like it would be great with a nice patio area. I especially liked the fact that you could get to the pool and your room without having to go into the casino area. We were traveling with a baby and a 7 year old. The 7 yr old loved Kid's Quest! A crib was furnished for the baby. Used the buffet for breakfast only. It was good for a great price.</p><br>DIRTY SOCK!<p>Stayed at Texas Hotel on 11-16-2012. Check into hotel without any problems, got onto the hotel elevator that got STUCK! Had to call the call the emergency phone twice before we got any response! Then the person didn't even say "hello" or anything just heard them pick up the phone. I was freaking out since I am already afraid of elevators! After the elevator fiasco got to the room, getting settled in and noticed a men's crusty dirty tube sock in the corner of the room by the bed! Called the front desk, and told them about it before 5PM requested for the sock to be removed and wanted some extra towels. We left for dinner and a movie got back to our room around 11PM and the CRUSTY DIRTY SOCK WAS STILL THERE and we didn't receive any additional towels!!!!! Called the front desk again and they acted like this is the first of them hearing of this issue. Lady came to the door with towels and I asked her if she was here to pick up the dirty sock in the room. She gave me a look like I was crazy....she went and inspected it for herself and said she was sorry for this a million times. Exactly how did they vacuum the floor without seeing this sock? Disgusting!!!!!</p><br>Great hotel<p>I just recently stayed here for 2 nights with my fiancee and 3 year old son. It was a nice trip and we were very pleased with our stay there. We showed up Friday afternoon and were able to get into our room immediately. For some reason they had us booked in a smoking room but when I corrected her she was able to quickly move us to a non smoking room. We had no problem using the a/c and it stayed on over night. I had read bad reviews about that before and was worried because I am quite pregnant and always hot but it worked perfectly for us. Also the counter top in the bathroom was nice and big. I hate going to a hotel and having no space to put my makeup and toiletries. We had the breakfast buffet Saturday morning and it was excellent. I normally hate Station casino buffets because they make us pay full price for our young son but for $5 I figured we could suck it up and pay for him. Our waitress for breakfast, Vivian, was amazing. She was super attentive and didn't even bat an eye when a glass of milk got knocked over. I would recommend showing up by 9 because when we left a little before 10 there was a line to get in and it was definitely more crowded. We also did the buffet that night for dinner after putting our son in KidsQuest and that was less than stellar. Most of the food smelled good but was actually pretty bland. Skip this and try one of the actual restaurants instead. My biggest complaint is about the lock on the door in the room. Our son is autistic and loves to run. The safety latch on the door is low enough that he could undo it. We've noticed this on a few other hotel doors recently as well so I don't know if it's a new trend or not but it's really annoying. The hotels need to go back to the old days where the latch was high enough that only grown ups could reach it.</p><br>Hotel fees for what?<p>weight room cool and internet access and then charge weight room cool and internet access and then charge you to connect to the internet. casino however it was not smokey at all which is a plus when you're traveling with minor however it was not smokey at all which is a plus when you're traveling with minor children I it would just be better if there were more restaurants there other than just the bus it would just be better if there were more restaurants there other than just the buffet option.</p><br></body></html>
