<html><head><h3>Texas Station Gambling Hall and Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 9</h3></head><body><br>Texas-size disappointment<p>We selected Texas Station for the "extras" available for our kids. Yes, the theater was nice and the bowling was fun. Food court offerings are not as complete as listed. But it was the very basics that were lacking. Even though I'd called in advance to make sure the pool was open, it was ice cold (and tiny, too boot). The Resort Fee supposedly covers WiFi, the fitness room, and a daily paper. We couldn't use any of them. WiFi is so weak you can't connect in your room. Half of the fitness machines were out of order, had notices for repair that were months old, and the manager seemed unaware and unconcerned when we brought it up. No newspapers in sight, even at the restaurants. Rooms were as basic as you can get and cleaning service was no more than a swipe of the bathroom sink. Super cheap place to stay. We got what we paid for.</p><br>Great Seafood Station<p>Had to go for my husbands birthday - he played two days for only the cart fee....we drove to Texas Station for the seafood station....love the clam chowder - also the fresh oysters for my husband. Cat was our server and we kidded her for working at a seafood station....liked the service and food well enough we drove here twice and ate the same. The chef was different so a bit of difference of taste but still good.
Room Tip: ask for away from the elevator

The first time I stayed here was with a high school softball team I was coaching. Perfect! Movie multi plex, food court, nice restaurants, bowling and convenient. My wife and I have stayed here quite a few times since then. The oyster bar is the best kept secret of Vegas. The rooms are average but at a good price. This is a good home base while visiting Vegas.</p><br>Feels like home away from home.<p>I have stayed at the Texas Station for 5 days every year for about 6 years and plan on staying again this year. The only thing different is I'll only stay one night this time on my way to my new home in Arizona. Every stay that I have spent there was very enjoyable, love the buffets and the cafe and the overall atmosphere is great. Everyone seems to always have a good time. I have always got a nice room and its alway clean and comfortable. i highly recommend staying with them all the time.</p><br>Out of the traffic<p>We like Texas Station. Lots of restaurant choices, only 10 minutes away from downtown Las Vegas, self contained (you never really have to leave) bowling alley, movie house and our favorite black jack table.
Room Tip: We like first floor which is really not ground level. It's easy access to everything, no waitin...

Lots of signs saying that a remodel was in progress but I saw no evidence of that. After a while my wife and I began to suspect it was all a cover for the dated accommodations. We ended up in a basement room, I had no idea these existed. The decor looked like someone in the 80's wanted a 70's look. However it did have a 40"-ish widescreen tv.

Over all it was an ok stay. But I don't think it'll be on my list again unless the price just destroys the other options in the area.</p><br>Choose another option<p>I arrived late around midnight. When I checked in, the thermostat on the wall was broken. There was only a thin velour blanket on the bed and dingy sheets, no comforter. There was no way to adjust the temperature in the room at all. The water in the sink was not functional. Because it was late and I was tired from traveling, I went to sleep instead of asking to change rooms. There was a band playing that night, so make sure to bring earplugs if you stay. In addition, I was not given the option of a non smoking room and the room smelled like smoke. They advertise free internet, but a stronger pay signal overrides the free connection so it was impossible to connect to the free signal. I booked through priceline and was charged a booking fee through them, and the hotel charged a resort fee on top of this. After all is said and done, you don't pay the uber cheap rate advertised--you may as well spend the extra money to stay at an actual nice hotel instead of this dump. I brought up my issues with the clerk in the morning when I checked out, and was told the front desk manager was away. When I brought up the issues with priceline, their response was that I hadn't reported the issues, so nothing would be done. Bottom line is, I never would pay out of pocket to voluntarily stay at a motel of this caliber, so they have to use priceline to fill the rooms. But, priceline won't help you either. So don't use priceline, and definately don't stay here!!!</p><br>Great time, great food<p>We all had a blast at Texas Station. It's a ways off the strip but that's what we love about this place. Hometown feel, dealers are very friendly and buffet is very good for an "off the strip" price. You won't be disappoint in this place unless you love the hustle & bustle of the strip casinos.</p><br>late arrival<p>I arranged for my son and granddaughter to stay here and they are not seasoned travelers- i doubled confirmed the room on dec 18 to Collin in reservations, explaining need for late arrival status- he thanked me saying it was good i told them so manager would not give the room away. They arrived and the last double bed room had been given away. they were not upgraded to a suite but given a single bed room with a cot.</p><br>Nice Cheap Buffet<p>I stayed here from the 15th to the 17th of November 2013.

I stayed in room 117 which had the view of the pool.

The Hotel was a bit old, smelly and needs some serious TLC. The rooms were comfortable and clean. The one thing I really hated about the room was the extremely loud AC/Heating unit - it sounded like it was about to blow.

Luckily I wasn't in the room as this is Vegas you can't stay in your room all day otherwise you may as well stay home.

The best feature of this hotel was the food!!! Especially with the BUFFET - $5 for breakfast, $7.99 for lunch and $9.99 for dinner and you can eat as much as you like and there was over 50 dishes including soups and desserts to choose from!

I'd rate the restaurant a 5 out of 5!

This hotel is great for families who have fussy eaters and who want to be a bit further away from the strip as it's 20 minutes drive to the Strip!
Room Tip: Rooms on the higher floors seemed to be more modern than the 1st floor rooms they seriously need som...
