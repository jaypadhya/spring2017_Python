<html><head><h3>Texas Station Gambling Hall and Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 5</h3></head><body><br>They don't honor your reservations<p>We called a month and a half in advance and made reservations for a non smoking room with a king size bed. They said it was no problem. When we arrived in Las Vegas, we checked in early and were told all they have left are smoking rooms with double beds. We were told they were completely booked up and there was nothing they could do about it (other than putting an ozone machine in our room). The room smelled awful, our clothes reeked of smoke. So did the beds and towels. I woke up both mornings with a sore throat. Texas Station does not honor the reservations that you make in advance.</p><br>Happy to Leave<p>We booked this hotel on line. Upon arrival for a 5 night stay, we were greeted by an extra charge of $12.50 per night. We were upset about that but were anxious to start our vacation, so we paid it. We arrived late so didn't pay too much attention to the room, we were tired and went to bed. We got up in the morning to find hard, crusty, dirty washcloths hanging on the shower rod. And there was hair all around the toilet, like someone sat on the toilet to shave their beard. Yuck! I can't believe we actually walked bare foot and slept in that room. When we complained, the front desk Clerk was very rude and tried to put us off. She did nothing to help out situation. So happy when I called Priceline asked for help and they got us OUT of that Hotel. The clerk tried to charge us for two nights when we only stayed one night. Will never set foot in that place again.</p><br>Avoid this hotel!!!<p>We booked 2 nights here recently for a quick weekend trip. We had prepaid and weren't able to cancel or we probably would have immediately upon arrival. The hotel check in and elevator is at the complete opposite end of the building from the valet, and they have no bellmen and only 1 luggage cart for the whole place. There is an entrance from the hotel desk, but there are lots of steps or a long ramp and was not convenient for carrying in our luggage, especially since my husband is recovering from knee surgery. So you either have to haul all your luggage from valet through the whole casino, or up the steps/ramp from the entrance at the hotel end with the luggage cart, if you're lucky enough to get it. The hotel is located in the middle of a not so great part of town, and most of the casino clientele looked like they had just walked in off the street. Another guest told us to be careful because her car keys had been stolen and security found them in one of the parking areas where someone had been trying to locate her vehicle with the remote. She also told us her room keys didn't work when they checked in, and we saw another guest in our hall who couldn't get into her room, either. The buffet is not bad and it's a great value if you have a players card. Our room was comfortable, no complaints there. My husband liked the casino because they have nickel poker and keno machines. He won a jackpot, so we were able to abandon our second booked night here and went to a nicer hotel on the strip. We won't be staying here again.</p><br>Neeede A Room In North Las Vegas<p>Check in was a breeze, with a very friendly staff. Room was #404 3 down from Ice and Elevator. Non smoking room, smelled fresh Carpet seemed newer. TV good and everything worked in the room. The furniture showed some signs of wear but all of it was in workable order. The Window was useless it faced another wall.
Room Tip: ask for a view room if it matters to you.

Covers had old stains. Carpet had sticky substance on it. When we called to address the issue of smoke smell in our non smoking room they blamed it on outside smoke. Buffet was nothing special. Will never return. Get better rates, better service, and quality staying at a cheap casino on the strip. Plus, while trying to pay for our buffet. The manager was blocking our path due to him dealing with a un happy guest on the ohter side of the cashier. Just thought it would be more professional if he didn't have this conversation across the counter and blocking peoples path to pay.</p><br>Nothings changed...<p>Stayed here about five years ago. Went back recently. Nothing was different, except the gaming machines. Nothing new with rooms, but price is still really cheap for a last minute place to stay. For the price I will be back.</p><br>Here we are again<p>This time I'm here with my daughter. This time we are staying on a upper floor and have avery nice view. The room is very clean and it looks like newly decorated. My daughter had never stayed here but when she lived here in vegas she used to come for the Feast Buffet, which is always really good. One of the best. She is very impressed with the room and everything else. It is very good value for the money.</p><br>Off strip, ok for price<p>We stayed here passing through Vegas. We had no reservations and they were able to accomodate us. Has the typical gambling and restaurants. We ate at a pizza place which was mediocre. The bowling was a nice touch (especially with a little discount given at check-in) since we don't gamble. No complaints about the room.</p><br>Trish check in representative<p>I am very please with Trish on how she took care of us while we had to make some changes on our stay..She is very very friendly and knew how to make us happy and comfortable...She is the reason we always stay longer at the Texas Station Hotel...I am always happy to see her and her voice is very pleasant and she is always happy to help us whenever we have a problem...Thank you Trish.</p><br>Great Place For The Price<p>My family and I were looking to celebrate my birthday on Dec 12, 2014 in Las
Vegas, NV so we started looking at the best deals out there for the weekend. We knew that the prices for that specific weekend were going to be high due to the NFR. After looking I decided to give the Texas Station a try, I had been there once before to watch a movie. The staff was very friendly, the rooms were very clean and up to date and the food court had some great food choices. Over all we all got a great night sleep and the kids had a blast. They have a Regal theater, bowling alley, an arcade , kid zone area where they watch the kids while the parents go out and have fun. I would definitely recommend this Casino to any who wants to save money yet get a nice clean and fun place to stay.
Room Tip: I specifically asked for a quiet room and the young lady at the counter gave us a non-smoking room o...
