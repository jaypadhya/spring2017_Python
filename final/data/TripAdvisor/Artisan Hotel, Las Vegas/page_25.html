<html><head><h3>Artisan Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 25</h3></head><body><br>Stunning hotel, equally stunningly terrible service!<p>We were a group of 13 who stayed at the Artisan for 5 nights recently in the lead up to our wedding ceremony. Firstly I would like to say that the hotel decor is stunningly beautiful. We were not disappointed with the art and dark slightly gothic feel throughout the hotel. Unfortunately this is where any pleasure in our stay ended. The staff are not only rude but completely ignorant towards guests and make no effort to conceal it. Upon check in I left my wedding dress at the check in desk for steaming. She advised it would be picked up that night and ready for collection the next morning. Upon returning to collect the next morning I was met with blank stares and no one knew anything about it. I was then informed that "IF" I had left my dress the previous night it wouldn't be back till late that afternoon. Lucky our wedding wasn't that day! Any requests for anything were constantly met with the same blank looks and everything seems to be a massive inconvenience to the staff (even simple requests like wine glasses as there were none in the rooms). We had reserved a bottle of vodka for a friends birthday as part of the free offer however when we tried to claim this it was refused and we were told they would never had allowed a booking that night as they were having a party that night. One night upon trying to return to our room during one of the Artisans "parties" we were refused entry to the lift by a bouncer regardless of the fact we had a room key. The bouncer was incredible aggressive told us to "back the f**k away from the lift". We had to wait at the check in counter until the manager could be contact who then had to escort us back to the lift so we would be allowed to return to our room. The Artisan does heat up after hours and if transvestites, animal porn at the bar, sperm in the pool and naked people walking out of the lifts is your thing, you will like it here. We are a young group and were there to party but despite the decor Artisan parties feel cheap and ooze tack. Friends had $1000 charged to their credit card with no authorization, the ATM's in the lobby didn't work and the counter staff just shrugged their shoulders, my list could just go on and on. We would never stay here again and there is no one I could recommend this hotel to.
Room Tip: Here's a tip - don't stay here.

I was staying on the strip with a friend who had been to the Artisan before so we went for dinner and to the bar one evening. The food was great at the restaurant and we had a blast at the bar. There was great music playing and the whole place is such a visual treat to look at. I will be back :-)</p><br>Worst service ever!<p>I have never had such bad service as I had here. And nobody even cares! I called the food and beversge director Burell, with my complaint, he said he would look into the matter, and call me back. He never did. The cocktail waitress Courtney robbed me. We reserved a table in the lounge, paid 180.00 for a bottle of kettle one, but the cocktail waitress added two more charges to my credit card. One for 165.00, and another for 40.00. Burell never called me back. I had to correct my problem through my bank.</p><br>Great Stay!<p>I stayed at the Hotel for 8 nights while taking a training course there. I had never been at this Hotel before. The hotel has a unique look that I enjoyed that differs from other hotels on the strip and it is located off the strip. It tends to be dimly lit in the lobby with interesting paintings and furniture in the lobby, the hallways and in the rooms. I dined a number of times in their restaurant and really loved the food and service. My room was comfortable. My experience was that the staff were quite helpful and friendly to me and the Manager Buel asked me everyday when he saw me how I was enjoying my stay. He seemed quite sincere in trying to ensure that I was happy at the Hotel. He was interested in any suggestions or comments I made. I saw that their lounge had a great DJ on weekends that that there was a line up of people outside from other hotels waiting to get into the lounge to dance. I think it is always a good idea to check with a hotel to see if it offers what you are looking for in your stay whether that is to gamble, party, or to get rest. This hotel had no gambling but I was not there to gamble so that was fine. Personally I found the price for the room was good and I really enjoyed my stay.

Room Tip: If you are concerned about music from the lounge being loud on weekends and are not wanting to party...
See more room tips</p><br>Artisian Avoid at all costs<p>My last 24 hours at this Hotel have been one of the most awful Hotel stays I have experienced. It is now Saturday night and I have been here since last Sunday. The valet gentleman *they don't work for the hotel contracted service) have been wonderful. Other than them, if I was the Manger everyone would be fired and a job fair would be held.
I have called every night for a wake up. The night desk clerk has been told about my phone's handset which never allows him to hear me. I call back nightly after he hangs up on me I tell him my handset is not working and ask for a wake up. Of course this AM I never got a wake up call.
The one day I ate in the restaurant I felt the waitress was rube (mus tbe th e troubled artist thing) , not in her words, but definitely in her attitude and actions. She was just not pleasant and appeared to want to be anywhere else. I went in a second day after waiting about 10 minutes she left me a menu and stated she would be right back. 10 minutes later she was still not back. 10 minutes later I went looking for her and I wandered around looking for her without success. As I was about to leave for a meeting in the Hotel she showed back up and when she asked if I wanted anything I informed her I now had no time to wait and l left. Saturday night finally fot my phone replaced but the replacment also not working, I ran into the watiress chick in the elevator. Coming down from the 5th floor with 3 friends waitress got on at 3 as I was describing the awful services at the Hotel. I turned to waitress and announced that she was also in the email, her comment to us "You know there are other hotels to stay at". I was livid and immediately went to the front desk to speak with the F&B Manager.
Internet / WIFI is abysmal. Since I have arrived the signal is intermittent and frequently dropping out. Once I could get a signal it would be very poor with your hotel site taking up to 2 minutes to load. Friday night after have the signal cutting in and out and being unable to access the Internet I finally called the desk clerk (yes the one who never addressed my phone) he offered to move me to another room (it was 330 AM ). When I asked if that would solve the problem he told me no (SO WHY DID HE OFFER). I have had several of your employees tell me that moving to another room would not solve the problem (Aria day front desk, several valets, security). THe propetry manager tell me there is not problem with thte wifi must be your computer, little does he know since he did nto ask it happened with 2 different computer and a a phone. (I dont travel light).

I called the GM on Tues or Wed never heard back from him. ( HE latter tells me he returned my call 15 times but never left a message and I had no missed calls, funny how that works) When I spoke with the manger this PM she told me that she had never heard of any Internet problems or phone issues. I find that since every other employee is aware that Internet is poor and not known by the Manger this shows an apparent lack if communication or interest on the part of the Manager. I would expect the GM of the property to at least return my message but alas I never heard from him until I called agin at 8 pmm on Sat. or a representative. I would think someone would have found the time to at least acknowledge my message.
I can truly say that I will never return to the hotel again and I am in town several times a year. I will also make for my Travel Agent is well aware of this poor conditions and staff involvement (or shall I say lack of involvement on the part of the front desk, and senior management staff.
Room Tip: Loud music on both ends depending on the day. SOME of the Wait staff could not care less about you...
See more room tips</p><br>Great To Party At To Noisey to Stay<p>We had a great time at the late evening partying but after our visit there would not ever stay. Not in a great part of town. Hard to get to and back out of. Far from the strip. I'm sure the rooms would be nice but the partying goes on until 8AM need I say more. Fun and interesting decor, I'd advise you go for a drink and then move on. Very youg crowd, we are not but still had a great time. Bartenders are great.</p><br>Not For Everyone: Great at What it Is<p>Stayed on a Friday night on a busy weekend when even Imperial Palace was $200/night. Got 2 rooms at Artisan for $89/night each, then moved over to Caesars for 2 nights.

Be aware: Artisan is off strip, has no casino, and is not quiet or relaxing (at least on the weekends).

For something different, Artisan really stands out. It is a boutique hotel with very eccentric decor; comfortable, well furnished rooms (with porn on the TV); a very nice small pool with great daybeds; and an after-hours club.

When I returned from my night out at about 2:30 am, it was really busy. I had intended to go up to the room and come back down, but ended up passing out on my bed. When I woke up at 7 am, the club was still going. This being Vegas, I went downstairs to the club and joined in! They were serving great cocktails (there is a bartender shift change from 7:30 to 8 am, so drink service is spotty at that time) and playing awesome eclectic music, had comfortable banquettes, an outdoor patio, and the pool was open.

This place is sexy. There were couples making out, massages on the day beds at the pool. Lots of girls seemed to be dancers or show girls ending their nights. It wasn't sleazy, but sexy. Lots of locals.

All of this was very late Friday night/Saturday morning. I understand that it's much more sedate on weeknights. Restaurant menu looked great; didn't try it. I highly recommend if you've been to Vegas before, are looking for a party (but don't want the expense and stress of the mega-clubs), are young and on a reasonable budget. When you want to go to the strip, it's a $5-$10 cab ride. But don't come on the weekend and complain about the noise!
Room Tip: Ask for a quiet room and they will do their best.

Every other hotel that I stayed at in vegas is nice to but Artsan prices are good for hotel stay and again bar/lounge is wonderful and I love there afterhours!! :) The artisan hotel stands out from all the rest. That's what makes it so great. :)</p><br>Not your typical Vegas experience!<p>Maybe not the place to stay if its your first visit to LV & want the Strip as its quite far, but if you are visiting LV for business @ the convention centre, or want a different type of experience, its fine!!
Its a bit like staying in a gothic mansion from an old B/W Dracula movie..yes, dimly lit, but what do you expect with a gothic theme!
The rooms were fine & clean. The small pool had a Miami feel, & the food in the restaurant was simply EXCELLENT, ( the breakfast is actually plated!) with prices very reasonable.
We were a bit worried about the weekend all-night party, even though we are young ( we had to work the next day ) but staying on the 4th floor, did not hear anything.
We have stayed at the Hard Rock Hotel twice a year,for the last 6 years, & this was BY FAR a better (& cheaper) experience. It may not be your typical Vegas experience but we would absolutely stay here again. Do you H/W & you'll be fine
Room Tip: 4th or 5th floor
See more room tips</p><br>Absolutely Amazing<p>Well this was our second stay and will NOT be our last!! As locals we look for that special touch that makes our weekend getaways totally amazing, and let me tell you the Artisan in Las Vegas is the best place to stay if you want an all around awesome experience. They have everything you need. The staff is by far the Best in Vegas of any other hotel and their dedication to the guests proves that point over and over again. furthermore, the food is top notch and should be ranked in Zagats!!!! Now as for the rooms, all I can say is WOW! no two rooms are alike as far as decor, each one has different little things that make them unique. This is a must stay hotel for anyone local our tourist. YOU WONT BE DISAPPOINTED!! By the way Aaron you rock dude!
Room Tip: all rooms are great
