<html><head><h3>Artisan Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 16</h3></head><body><br>Don't plan to sleep; room better suited to rent by the hour<p>A few years ago, I was stationed in Las Vegas and previously loved the Artisan for its atmosphere and thought it would be a great place to stay to get away from the noise of the big hotels. I had seen that since my departure they had turned their nice lounge into an After-Hours hot spot. What was not clearly conveyed was the fact that you should not expect to be able to actually sleep in your hotel room. To say the music was loud would not come close to the ear-splitting concert-level sound exploding from the club area. The music was so loud that we had to yell to the clerk at the desk, but she assured us that in our room on their top floor we shouldn't be able to hear it the music. We could hear it very clearly, but we were so exhausted that we were able to drift off anyway. About 1 a.m., they really got the music cranking and sleep (if you are sober) was not a possibility. I tossed and turned about an hour before I went to the front desk to talk to them about it. Tyras (the clerk) told me that they were well known for their After-Hours Party and that I should have expected it. I then spoke to the "operations manager" Mortine who was really nice but had no real authority. She offered to help find me another room if I wanted to leave, but due to it being Spring Break the cheapest she could find was $350. She was very sweet, but was not able to remedy the situation in any way. She told me she would send a message to Dillon (the main Manager) and inform him of the situation. She told me the party would end at 0700. At 0720, the "party" was still in full swing and I spoke to Tyras again who said it might last until 0900, but I could talk to the other managers Ashley or Dillon when they arrived at 0900. Since I have to depart for the airport in two hours, I resigned myself to a hot shower (loved the bathroom) and some coffee. I went back down to the lobby to speak with one of the managers, but only found a different clerk named Tara (who again was a manager, but had no real authority). She again e-mailed Dillon and subsequently informed me that he would not be available until the afternoon. I asked if I could speak to him over the phone since I would be on a flight this afternoon. She sent him a message, but he told her to get my information and he would call me. I asked why he couldn't authorize a refund or some kind of compensation to her, she didn't know. It has been two weeks, and I've yet to receive even the courtesy of some type of communication. If it had not been for the excessive decibel level of the party, the hotel is otherwise enjoyable enough. However, I usually get a room to sleep in, so if I can't sleep what is the point? Judging by the how well the party was hopping, they could probably limit the complaints and increase the profits by charging for rooms by the hour...the hotel is located in the right part of town for that.</p><br>Artisan Hotel in Vegas, up-and downsides<p>We spend our anniversary in the Artisan Hotel. My husband looked for a romantic, different kind of hotel in Vegas and thought this would be a good choice.
The hotel is actually really cool. The art, the whole style of the hotel, dark and romantic was inspiring. We actually even liked the fact that it wasn't right on the strip, but right behind it....away from the craziness but still right there.
The room was very nice and clean. The bathtub was dissappointing, but the showerhead made up for that.
Even the mandatory valet parking (unless you wanna park across the street) wasn't a problem. A couple bucks for the valets won't hurt you in Vegas.

There were a few things that were not OK though. I don't mind loud and noisy hotels when I book a room knowing it's gonna be that way. But the Artisan promotes itself on their website as quite Sunday to Thursday and this was not the case when we stayed there on a Sunday night.
Also, we used the promo banner on the website giving us a great deal for the room (although you can find much cheaper hotel rooms in Vegas right on the strip), it did promised a free bottle of champagne in the room. We never received that unfortunaly. It was part of the reason my husband choose this hotel, since it was our anniversary and he thought that would be a very nice touch.

So we had mixed experience with this hotel. Would I pay full price to stay here again, unlikely. With the right deal, I probably do come back and just anticipate that their might be noise ect.

I do wanna make one special compliment towards one of the valets. Tony was simple fantastic. He is the kinda valet you want to tip and not just to be polite.
Room Tip: Try to get a room on the top floor, at least the noise nuisance will be less annoying.

Currently (as of the time of this writing on 03/23/13) the Artisan's own website says from Sunday to Thursday it is quiet place to stay and on Friday and Saturday they have the night life.. however, when I checked in last Monday I was notified that they now have added Wednesday and Thursday to this, so I guess Sunday - Tuesday are now the only quiet nights. I'm not sure why the website hasn't been updated to reflect this, it's an important consideration to me whether or not I'm going to be able to sleep on a given night or not.

The hotel itself is a very cool place, it's a great location not far from anything worth seeing in Vegas and the decor and property are quite fascinating. It's definitely worth a visit, just be aware of what you are getting into, and perhaps check directly with them about exactly what nights are the loud nights.
Room Tip: Maybe ask for one as far away from the lounge as possible.

While not happy about that aspect, I can say with certainty that the valet drivers are not only personable, but highly intelligent conversationalists.Upon walking into the lobby, you are immediately enthralled with art hanging from ceiling(literally) to floor; the ambiance is enchantingly mysterious. The staff courteous, kind and attentive.
Had I not been there for business, the stay would have been an experience to remember; however, I was there for business.
Drawbacks include: noise, distance from strip activities, lack of available restaurants, no vending machine for snacks/soda. No room service weeknights after 10:00 PM.
Room Tip: If you want a quieter stay, ask for a room that is on the opposite side of the club. Also, bring you...

That's what happened to my brother and me when we wanted to get a room there they wouldnt let us in. It was do to the afterhours club. when we went in later that night it was a great place to stay something about the atmosphere made me fall in love with the place. The gothic theme and clean rooms made it one of my best value trips ever. The club was fun and the staff knowledgable. The club stays open way into the morning so if you can't sleep with noise then bring ear plugs. I look forward to my next visit in less then a week so I can experience everything thing they have to offer. The Artisan is a must to go with a partner or friend to have fun with and experience a nightlife when the vegas strip nightclubs close. I will be recommending to all my friends to stay.</p><br>Hiden gem in Vegas, Adams Family meets Sex and the City<p>A waitress recommended this place to us and we visited for a drink. Wow! It's like nothing I have ever seen before. Dark, gothic, sumptuous. The bar is fabulous. Staff wre great and kind enough to show us a room...we will definitely stay here next time we are in Vegas. It seems well priced, great location and only minutes from the strip.
Room Tip: High floor as the club is loud and open util 7!

This hotel has quite the reputation for being THE locals after hours hot spot ~ especially on the weekends. After 10PM be prepared to show your ID just to enter the lobby! The locals I asked, also said that the hotel is know to be a "swingers" hotel with a topless pool and free porn in the rooms. But I digress, let me start by saying that the hotel is extremely unique and in a convenient location just off the 15 with easy access to The Strip. The moment you walk in, every wall, even the ceiling is covered in artwork or mirrors ~ it's very dark and reminded me of a Disney themed haunted house. The room size was average with basic amenities and a great view of the strip. The bathroom was small with a pedestal sink and no place to unpack toiletries but ok for a short stay. In fact the hotel was interesting and almost charming until about 9PM when the DJ arrives and the walls BOOM and SHAKE with the club noise. I stayed on the 4th floor and specifically requested a quiet room. Even with my sound machine and a pillow over my head I could hear music until 6AM Friday and Saturday morning! I had an early departure flight on Saturday morning and had to roll my luggage through drunken party goers to get to the front desk. I know the hotel has heard the noise complaints before but I don't think they are going to "turn it down" anytime soon because they probably make a fortune on the weekends.</p><br>My "Me Day"<p>Overall, I give theis property a 4.75 out of 5 stars, simply becuase the only avenue in which to obtain ice was to go down to the bar and have them fill the ice bucket. As a local, I will do just about anything to avoid visiting the Las Vegas Strip, lol! Therefore, I am always in the market for an amazing off Strip property to wind down, entertain friends and dine. I absolutely love The Artisan, so much so that I had my 10 year wedding anniversary dinner here a few years back for a paty of 15. In addition and even more recently, a close girlfriend of mine was married here and it was PERFECT. The rooms and their art deco style are lovely, the warm, dim, sexiness of the lighting work wonders for your "Alter Ego" :-) I also appreciate the fact that an active room key is required to operate the elevator. The artwork and mirrors throughout the entire property are AMAZING and there is not a single empty, unfilled, open area on this entire property that has not been filled with decor. The pool area is wonderfully tucked away and the daybeds and cabanas are nice and sexy-lilke. I love the intimate feel of The Artisian and am not surprised that the owners are the same as Rumors, located locally as well . If you enjoyd the Artisan you are certain to enjoy Rumors! Thanks and happy travels...
Room Tip: There are only 5 floors, LOVED my room, requested furthest from the elevator and actually had a grea...

Lacks responsiveness. Restaurant service is poor . Cabs don't turn up on time. Overall not a great experience</p><br></body></html>
