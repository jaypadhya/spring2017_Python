<html><head><h3>Artisan Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 23</h3></head><body><br>I was pleasantly surprised!!!!<p>We went to the Artisan because my boyfriend wanted to go there for his 41st birthday. He used to live in Vegas and this was a favorite local "hotspot" for after hours.
I checked online for reviews and saw some discouraging things, but he said it was nice and fun so I contacted the hotel manager Ms. Keyes for some bday surprises.
After emailing the manager, I immediately received a call from her. She was so awesome! I upgraded to a suite on the 5th floor and she gave me a great deal. I had some specific requests like champagne, chocolate covered strawberries, bday balloons, his favorite candies waiting, etc, etc and she took care of EVERYTHING! She even gave him a hand written card signed from herself and staff. What a personal touch! He was so surprised and impressed. He couldn't imagine how I pulled it all off and without the staff at the Artisan (and mainly Ms. Keyes), I would have never been able to arrange everything.
As far as the hotel goes it is really cool! Very dark, goth, medival with a modern twist. Loved the decor. I usually stay at places like the Aria, Luxor etc and this place is very unique, quirky, beautiful and fun. The hotel is located right off the freeway, but I didn't notice noise. I loved the vallet parking! So convenient and very friendly attendants. In fact all the staff was friendly and helpful. Even the lady in housekeeping. I loved her. She was so genuine and nice! Not one complaint! In fact, because it's a small property, you get better service and they remember you. Everyone knew about my surprise and would ask..."Was he surprised? Did he like it?" This made me feel important, special and cared about!
If you go to this hotel know that it is a party spot. There is loud music but who goes to Las Vegas to sleep and complain? If you are? Then go to a different spot like the Aria where there's no alcohol served.
I WILL return to the Artisan 100%! I loved every quirky detail and the AMAZING customer service. Thank you The Artisan and especially Ms. Keyes!! You helped make this the best birthday he has had in years!! See you ALL soon!!!!!!
Room Tip: 5th floor has some really nice suites.

From the moment Valet took my keys and me entering the hotel lobby my jaw dropped!! I was shocked the hotel was very much laid back and the wonderful front desk manager Ximena chekced me in. I also chatted with the general manager as well when I was checking in. I also helped the general manager with his iphone. Ximena asked me what room would I like. I was wondering what she meant then she explained that the rooms are named after famous painters. Wow really that's neat! I let Ximena pick my room and the room choice she picked for me was perfect!! The bed was amazing and very comfortable. I also love the fact the bathroom had black title, it was very different and unique! The general manager and Ximena also sent up a free bottle of champagne, again they blew my mind! Because of how i was treated from checking in to when I checked out, every time I come to Vegas this will be my hotel of choice. I will also let all my family and friends know about my wonderful weekend in Vegas thanks to the wonderful staff at the Artisan hotel.</p><br>I will ALWAYS stay at The Artisan when I go to Vegas. Never, ever will I stay anywhere else!<p>I first stayed at The Artisan Hotel in August of 2011. I have since stayed there four more times in less than a year and will never, ever stay at any other hotel in Vegas. My local friend recommended it to me for its affordable rates and awesome ambiance, in addition to an optional topless pool in the Summer... Note: I am female, and I highly appreciate option of letting the ladies out. Tan lines suck.

The staff were/are INSANELY accommodating. They remember you by name, days later. To speak about their amazing assistance: I rented a cabana for a day and asked for blueberry mojitos in the special requests section of my application. Turns out, they didn't actually serve blueberry mojitos, so the staff went to the store, bought fresh blueberries and muddled pitchers after pitchers of said beverage throughout the day, for no extra charge. Anything extra that you may request seems to never come with an additional service charge. I asked to have a bottle of Jim Beam and a 2-lieter of Coke waiting for us in our room before we arrived, and even though the receptionist would have to go to the nearest corner store to get it, only the cost of the products would be applied to my bill. I swear you could ask for the moon and they would give it to you.

The rooms at The Artisan are all unique, in that each room features a different artist (e.g. The "Monet" room or the "Warhol" room). The hotel boasts luxurious red velvet love seats and couches in the hallways with dim lighting and a sexy ambiance overall. This hotel is 21+ and geared toward night owls with a passion for letting loose. Thus, I wouldn't recommend this boutique hotel for individuals that have difficulty sleeping with the soft bump of bass reverberating from the downstairs dance floor. Bring earplugs. Eye masks are not necessary since the rooms are dark and basically caves when the blinds are closed! The beds are not too firm, not too soft (Goldilocks would approve), and they provide you ample amounts of pillows. The bathrooms are modest but very tasteful and clean, and the shower heads ROCK.

The drinks at the bar are reasonably priced and the dishes at Mood Restaurant are delicious and the restaurant also provides room service. Their fried calamari with cherry pepper compote is making me salivate just at the thought of it...

All in all, I love this hotel. It is, by far, Las Vegas' best kept secret.
Room Tip: You can request to stay in a specific artist's room (e.g. The "Warhol" or "Monet...

The staff was exceptional and spot on. The restaurant food was exceptional also! If you like art and a one of a kind ambiance, you MUST, and I repeat MUST, stay here!
Also, check out the quaint chapel and the wine cellar! And don't forget about ALL the artwork! You can even request a specific artists room!
A diamond in the desert for sure!!

Room Tip: Ask for a specific artist if you have one! Also, on the weekends they have music in the bar. If you...
See more room tips</p><br>Yum yum<p>I visit Las Vegas a few times a year as my daughter works in one of the shows there. I am from Ireland.
We go to the Artisan for lunch and dinner quite a few times in the Mood restaurant and the food is so Nice and presented beautifully , and the staff so friendly.

We saw the wedding chapel while there and I have now booked my wedding for May 2012.
We have booked The Mood restaurant for our reception of course.
We are so looking forward to treating all our guests at Our favourite place.
I am emailing from Ireland and getting plenty of the info we need for our day.
I will let you know how it goes. So excited!!!</p><br>I cannot wait to go back; LOVE this hotel!<p>I travel for a living, therefore I'm under the impression "you've been to one hotel, you've been to them all." The Artisan does NOT fall into that category. I ABSOLUTELY loved it!!

My chin hit the floor when I walked into the lobby the other night. Visually stimulating!! It looks somewhat like the hunted mansion at Disneyland. Paintings covering the walls and ceiling, dim lit chandeliers, an entire library of books, candles, a fountain, mirrors, heavy drapes, statues, and the red elevator door (like the one in The Shining). I checked in quickly, dropped my bags in my room, grabbed a glass of wine at the bar, and went on a tour.

The halls are completely decorated with artwork from all different types of artists. Each room is dedicated to one particular artist. The rooms are quaint, and provided what I was looking for.

The bar and restaurant were equally as intriguing, with good food and beautiful people. The patio area is so cool and comfortable, and the pool looks like it would be the perfect place to be when the weather warms up.

I love that it's not a casino, and it is the local after hours hot spot. It is a party all weekend long. The staff is incredibly friendly and helpful. I can't wait to see them again soon.
Room Tip: If you're looking for something quiet, I wouldn't stay on the weekends. I came in on Mond...
See more room tips</p><br>THINKING ABOUT STAYING HERE? YOU SHOULD RECONSIDER! PLEASE READ!<p>We arrived on a thursday night and everything went pretty smooth with the check in. But once it came time for bed, well that never happened. We didn't sleep at all music played ALL night till about 10am. We were informed about their night club and told they were putting us on the top floor where it was quiet. Haha yea right it was sooo loud it seemed like there was a speaker outside our window. We cod even hear people in their parking lot. It is so ridiculous to play your music outside. Keep it inside so your actual hotel guests who like to sleep don't have to hear it. The next night the same thing happened. We also had a ton of people in our hallway who were yelling at each other off and on through out the night and early morning. We called down to the front desk (around 4am) to get someone to come and shut them up. They said to us they were sorry and they could get the manager on the phone and maybe we could get a free night. Are you serious!  We don't care about that all we wanted was security to come and take care of the situation. We were told someone would be up in ten minutes, but surprise they never showed.  So Saturday night rolls around and it's about 2am and the cleaning people decide they are going to vacuum the room right next to ours!  Of course that was loud but the guy decided to ram the vacuum into the wall a couple times and he also had the tv up super loud so he could here it over the vacuum!  I finally got mad enough I got up and asked him to stop which he did. But vacuuming at 2am! Come on people. When we confronted the front desk about our stay they pretty much had that [--] it attitude and said well it happens!  You know if you want a nightclub then have a nightclub without a hotel. This was not our first time here. We stayed a few years back and it was nothing like that. It's sad what this hotel has turned into. We will NEVER come back!</p><br>Weekend stay<p>We arrived on a friday evening and the first room that we were put in the ceiling was leaking over the bathtub, then we were put in a second over the club and we couldn't sleep for music going all night. couldnt turn the heater on because it sent out a foul odor. the window didn't have a screen, and it didn't wanna close. I will never refer this place to anyone I know, not even a homeless person if they could stay for free.
Room Tip: Dont stay at this hotel
See more room tips</p><br>Unusual, artsy hotel<p>My husband & I stayed here 1/18-1/22/12. Even when we first arrived, I wasn't impressed by the cleanliness, but when we left, we found a bottle of lube under the bed! We also trued their restaurant, Mood, but it failed to impress as well. That said, the prices are good, it's conveniently located off/north of the strip....about 10 mins from most strip locations. The hotel IS impressive in its decoration. Lots of art, dark & cozy. And the staff is exceptionally friendly. In fact, i told the desk clerk about the lube & he said to book through him next time & he'd make sure the room was clean. I say ALL rooms should be clean! If you're staying on a Friday or Saturday night, they'll warn you that the club goes till 7 or 8 am. They aren't kidding, but if you're on the 5th floor and have earplugs, you should be fine.</p><br>Bottom of the barrel....<p>3 of us booked a 2-bed room months ago for NYE. We were assigned one king, which was not the worst thing, by far. If you are used to being treated with respect and dignity, as we have (- from places like Wynn and MGM, to the low raters like IP and Wild Bill's) - look somewhere else. Coming back to the hotel on night, doormen and even a snippy little manager triedto get us to pay to enter - when we have rooms there, and have been staying there! WTF??? Not a hassle you need after a long day on the strip. And forget about ice - none available for us, thank you so much - what kind of hotel/motel does not have ice for it's guests? Broken room fixtures, a tub that would not drain (gross!), and the continuous music assured us that rest would be evasive. I would never stay here again, or recommend it. Everyone except the maids had a big attitude - for whatever reason, because the place is far from "all that"... gluing reproduction art to the ceilings and keeping the lighting low does not make it a gothic wonderland. If you just want a place to get F'd up and don't care about cleanliness, showering, sleep, or being treated like an adult human, stay here!
Room Tip: Pick one in another hotel!
