<html><head><h3>Artisan Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 4</h3></head><body><br>Extremely noisy<p>Checked into hotel and found our room to be extremely noisy from adjacent freeway. And shades in room are broken - requested makeshift repair. Did not happen. Difficult to get to off any street, parking is valet only, furnishingings shabby. Staff not responsive to concerns</p><br>Go for their parties, not to stay<p>This was a good budget hotel. We were a bit disappointed that the pool wasn't lively, but we found another one to go to on the strip. It's a dark hotel; almost like it's haunted. Very unique, some will like it.</p><br>Surprised its not rented by the hour<p>The front desk person was missing in action for at least 10 mins when checking in. The room was outdated, bed uncomfortable, carpet bunched up spots, and just felt dirt. The music was bumping all night, however the front desk did repeatedly warn us it would be loud all night. To be fair, my boyfriend and I had never intended...
More </p><br>Awesome stay!<p>This 21+ hotel is budget-friendly and party friendly! All for $50 we got a nice sized room, an adult party, and complementary porn channels. To come here from Utah was a real treat as we definitely DO NOT have anything like this in Utah, it was a pleasant stay with great staff and the gothic decor was to beautiful! Would...
More </p><br>Ok Stay...<p>Just to be fair..im going to say this hotel is definitely NOT for every one. It may be just right for you if your looking to party (after the party). Its dark, dinjy, and smells. The rooms were dated and sheets had stains. it was bootlegged- and kinda spooky. But there's an up-side. I had a view of the strip...
More </p><br>If you wanna party, come here!<p>This place is great if you want to be off the strip but still have a great time. This is definitely a young couples or singles hotel. The pool has a DJ Saturdays and Sundays great music and great atmosphere. (this is a topless pool). The afterhour is a plus. just be careful staying out past 6am, you will see...
More </p><br>Wish we could go back<p>About the noise : we asked for a quieter room and were placed top rear. Quiet enough for us, but we're used to a little background noise. The pool was extra cool. Topless. Private. Chill. Party 24*7 Fri-Sun. Young party crowd. Lots of tats and such. Music is electronic. Atmosphere is way more rock n roll than the Hard Rock....
More </p><br>hmmm...<p>I visited Las Vegas with my sister, mom, and two aunts. I did not feel comfortable at this hotel with my mom and aunts. Had it been just my sister and I or my husband and I, it wouldn't have felt quite so awkward. I was able to book the hotel on another site for super cheap (We were sort...
More </p><br>Could not be better!<p>The Artisan is probably not for everyone, but anyone who has spent a moment in old Europe will appreciate the appeal. We spent five great days there during the week. From the moment of arrival to the moment of departure, the entire staff could not have been more accommodating, courteous, or pleasant. The decor is both appealing and amazing, the...
More </p><br>Not worth it<p>I appreciate the bizarreness of the place, and the very off-strip location. Full disclosure -- I hate Las Vegas, and I wanted to find somewhere interesting to stay with my husband before I spent a Sunday at a convention. I thought it would be a goth version of the Madonna Inn, and an escape from the gross adult Disney feel...
