<html><head><h3>Artisan Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 24</h3></head><body><br>Older hotel but amazing atmosphere..dark gothic fantasy hotel<p>My husband and I choose this hotel based on the atmosphere the artisan creates..we are Las Vegas locals who just wanted to celebrate our wedding anniversary. It is a dark hotel with many paintings, ornate picture frames and mirrors all over the whole place. It feels like you are in an eccentric mansion filled with antiques. I thought this hotel creates a mysterious and romantic vibe. It is a unique place.. I believe to be a place for adults since the hotel caters to the after-hours lounge.The bar was big and had plenty of areas to sit and enjoy your drink inside or on the outside patio. Their pool was nicely decorate with several cabana beds. It was a small pool but it felt intimate n posh. We didn't use the pool but we would love to throw a private pool party there one day in the summertime. We also had dinner at the Mood restaurant. The hotel does weddings also and they have a small gothic style chapel with a bridal dressing room. We love the artisan and will go back again. Maybe even renew our vows there and have a party. I think it's a great place for it.</p><br>Good Times...<p>A good friend recommended the Artisan hotel for its extraordinary- and free, mind you- afterhours. This is the only place to be if you like good music, friendly staff, and an overall fun time. It is typically a quiet place Sunday- Thursday, but once Friday evening rolls around-the party definitely gets started. That recommendation was two years ago. Now, when I go to Vegas, the only place I consider is the Artisan Hotel. It is a small and comfortable environment that is away from the strip and the masses. By the way, their restaurant is awesome as well- a small menu- I tried several dishes, and all of them were delicious.</p><br>Fabulous Place to Be!<p>The hotel is just a beautifully set and decorated hotel with a great theme to it. The first word that came to mind was "swank" with a flair of gothic enigma to it. From the front desk to the restaurant to the bar and even the valets - everyone was incredibly cool, very affable, friendly, open and relaxed and about my comfort during my stay. Loved the patio, the bar was plush and the bar had a good feel to it. The After Hours that happens there on the weekend from 1am - 7am is absolutely fun! If you don't like loud music this late - then you're in the wrong place. I had no problem with it.

It IS dimly lit within the hotel itself; however, it added to the ambience of the hotel. I LOVE that there is no casino in there. Thank you! I will definitely be staying here again.
Room Tip: If you're staying during a weekend, there isn't really any quiet rooms because of the After...

When you drive up it almost feels like a friend's expensive house with the lit trees and the curtains. The lobby is dark and covered with chandeliers, paintings, fountains, and books. The hallways are also covered in paintings. I felt like I was in a vampire movie! I was just waiting to see Count Dracula waiting in the lobby! ;) The room was clean and beds comfortable. The staff was friendly and helpful. No gambling here, only a bar and restaraunt. My only warnings are: this place is very dark, almost movie theater dark, even the elevator has red lights. The rooms have lights but the are not super bright. I didn't find this bothersome, but I know some people would. Also, I had read other complaints of loudness. We stayed on the side facing the main street and we could hear a lot of traffic noise. A couple of times we could hear some loud people in the hallways. We didn't stay on a Friday or Saturday, so we didn't have to deal with the club/bar noise, but I could see how it may be quite loud. I recommend not staying there if you are a light sleeper or need it very quiet. But if you want a change and a different experience definitely give this place a try! You won't regret it!</p><br>Not bad.<p>My boyfriend and I were somewhat hesitant to stay here, given the mixed reviews on this site - but, we figured we might as well give it a shot since we're not ones to like big chain hotels. We arrived on Thanksgiving morning at 8 a.m. and figured we would bum around town to kill time until check in. My boyfriend had the idea of trying to ask if they would let us check in early and Yadira (I think that was her name) at the front desk was very accomodating and allowed us to check in at 9 a.m. We ate breakfast at Mood since we had an hour to kill and Wes (our waiter) was very nice, helpful, and happy to chat with us. We wanted to stay in the restaurant just to talk with him longer! Definitely a nice experience so early in the morning.

Overall the room was ok, we stayed in the Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec room. We got a complimentary bottle of champagne upon check-in as the special for staying in the month of November. The AC unit wasn't working, I told Ximena (the manager) and she said she would send someone right up-within 5 minutes they came up and fixed it for us. The handset on the telephone did not work, however, and even trying to use speakerphone was a bit difficult. We had to push the "0" button mulitple times just to dial the front even once.

Friday night we came back to the hotel after seeing a concert and the nightlife was in full effect-I was nervous because I've read all the reviews about people not being able to sleep, but we could not hear the music at all.

We were dissatisfied with the attitude of valet staff and the nighttime room service waiters as well. One new employee took our credit card number over the phone, had us sign the receipt, and came up to the room again later saying he needed to re-run the card and sign a secondary receipt. This was somewhat of a concern as we were afraid of being charged twice-it seemed a little strange.

Lastly, the hotel is in somewhat of a bad neighborhood, my boyfriend woke me up at 2 a.m. because he heard gunshots. I thought I was dreaming, but sure enough, those were gunshots. We have no clue where they were coming from, but they were loud enough to wake us up.

We aren't the type of people to like big chain hotels and clubs, so we felt somewhat at home in this hotel. It favors an alternative crowd, which we liked. Overall, we would stay here again.</p><br>Dirty<p>Hotel is beautiful.
BUT I am very disappointed to come to a dirty room. My room wasn't vaccumed, night stands wer dirty and full of crumbs and bathroom wasn't evn moped. Nd it was all dusty and mirrors all dirty. I don't believe ths room was cleaned after the last ppl left. I tthink they just made the bed and that was it.
SO DISSAPONTED!!!!
Wanted to cancel my stay but they would charge me 60. Ugh
Oh nd cleaning fee if you leave room dirty is $150.
CAN U BELIEVE THAT.... makes me so mad.</p><br>Hidden Jewel of Vegas<p>If you are tired of the typical strip nightlife such as long lines, expensive, too crowded everywhere then this place is what you want. It's more like staying and playing in a large mansion than a hotel or club. Also you should like electronic dance music like I do in order to love this place.

Pros: Mysterious decor, low lighting, and paintings make a very unique experience
Staff is friendly and accommodating
Rooms were clean and are decorated like the lobby; very unique
Club, bar, and patio make a sweet combination of excitement, selection, and relaxation
On weekends the place doesn't stop until the sun rises

Cons: Place doesn't stop until the sun rises (If you don't like that)
No ice machines; have to get ice from the bar
Drinks can be a little pricey after midnight but is to be expected

Overall it is my new place to frequently visit on the weekends, highly recommend to those who want nightlife but not the headaches the bigger clubs give you in Vegas.</p><br>I'm pretty sure the word "Artisan" stands for "Pits of Hell"<p>The only good thing about this hotel is the layout in the lobby. The rest of it is an abomination.

Firstly - Bed Bugs. When I left the Artisan hotel after 4 nights, I had bites on my wrists and ankles. Not once over those four nights did the hotel service my room, despite requests to the Hotel Management.

Secondly - Service. Or lack of? The staff are so apathetic towards any guests request and judging by previous reviews, this is nothing new. They were the most unaccommodating hotel staff I have EVER encountered. Blank faces, snarky responses to questions and general feel of "I don't care" oozed from their facial expressions.

Thirdly - Pool. I'm not sure how they are able to keep the pool open when there is human discharge clearly floating in the water. There must be some interesting parties that happen down there at whatever hours. But this is an all time low for any hotel. When advising the hotel staff, they again seemed to not care at all and simply said "Stay away from the pool if you can't handle it".

Fourthly - Location. It's not on the strip. It's 30mins walk to the strip and that's to the bottom of the main part of Las Vegas Blvd South.

I could go on and on about the lack of quality this hotel provides. All I can advise is avoid at all costs, there is bound to be better "party" hotels in Las Vegas than this place. Tacky would be an understatement.</p><br>Very strange<p>Mmm, what can I say. It's cheap. But it's not really Vegas. Do your self a favour and book a proper hotel on the strip.</p><br>An OK stay!<p>The hotel was dark, artsy and stylish! Loved the decor and the feel of it as you walk in. I wanted to stay at this hotel because I heard good things about the place. I heard celebrities like the Kardashians stay here whenever they're in town. With high expectations, reality hit me and was immediately disappointed.
Upon check-in, the front desk people weren't as accommodating as I had hoped. On the hotel's site, they had a breakfast special which you can add with your room reservation. But because there was a problem, I called and asked if that's something they can note on my account since I couldn't do it online. I was advised to just book the room without the breakfast and to just bring it up when I come in; in which I did. As I spoke with the two ladies at the front desk, neither one of them was willing to accommodate my request so i left it at that.

As we walked into our room, I knew right away that we won't be able to sleep in because although the room was dark, there were no heavy curtains only blinds which let light in even when they're closed. The air conditioner was the old, bulky unit that blew strong air (which I thought was good since it drowned the noise coming from outside). But when it wasn't blowing, you could hear the industrial a/c from neighboring buildings and people's conversations from the hallway because the walls and door were thin.
The location of the hotel was in a bad neighborhood next door to strip clubs and warehouses/offices so don't expect to have a great view.
The handset on the phone was broken so we had to order room service using the speakerphone. Surprisingly, the food was excellent! If only it didn't come in "to go" containers and delivered in a plastic bag.
As we got ready, the blow-dryer was broken and their iron leaked of grainy water which showed in black clothes.
However, one person whom I will remember was Drake. I didn't get the pleasure of meeting him until I checked out of the hotel. He listened to some of my concerns and even noted my account a free bottle of champagne on my next visit should I decide to stay there ever again. He was very professional, accommodating and respectful. He made my stay somewhat better despite the negatives.
Artisan was just ok. Although, this wouldn't be the first hotel I would recommend to friends and family but it also wouldn't be out of the equation.
Room Tip: If size doesn't matter then any room is ok but I would suggest getting a suite if possible.
