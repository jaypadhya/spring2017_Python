<html><head><h3>Crossland Economy Studios - Las Vegas - Boulder Highway Hotel Reviews Page 1</h3></head><body><br>A Total Dump<p>I moved to Las Vegas for a job and needed a place to live until I rented an apartment or bought a new home. The ads for this hotel looked great. The experience was terrible. When I arrived, I was placed on the third floor. I had all of my clothes for work as well as everything I needed to live for a month in my car. The stairs to the third floor were shut down with caution tape. I had to make multiple trips up another set of stair and then cross to where my room was located. When I entered the room, it smelled like recirculated cigarette smoke and mold. The carpet was nasty. The furnishings were filthy. (After complaining via an online survey from the company, someone tried to clean the place, but it didn't work.) Each day when I left, there were dirty baby diapers and feminine hygiene products on the first floor sidewalk. I had paid nearly $1000 for a month of living. I was determined to survive, but I didn't make it. After 10 days, I moved out. The front desk staff was rude and inhospitable. For a city based upon hospitality, it is one of the few places I have discovered where the staff was actually rude. When I checked out, the receptionist made a point to share that I would receive no refund for the remaining 20 days because I had pre-paid. I told her I didn't want the money: I simply wanted to get out! Unless you are accustomed to living in squalor, don't let the online photos fool you. It is simply false advertising.</p><br>I USUALLY STAY THERE FOR 3 MONTHS.<p>After three months there, I checked out on May 15th, 2015. the mgr. Olivia and assist. mgr Tracy are wonderful. Any little problem, they will resolve asap. Fact is, ALL the office staff are super !!!! I have been staying their for the past 4-5- years.
Room Tip: Always check with Olivia,if staying for 30 days or longer

All the building and propriety are left alone without cleaning and maintenance. Both the inside doors, the one of the bathroom and the one of the bedroom had big holes from punches, every thing was dirty and very dark. Air conditioned only in the living room with a hole whit a fan in the dividing wall to cool bad room. With 110 outside not very effective. TV did not work, internet super slow. This place should be closed.
Room Tip: Choose a different hotel!

Police were knocking on wrong door looking for guest. No utensils in the room. The surrounding area is scary. Broken appliances. Cable service was awful and fuzzy.</p><br>RUN FOR YOUR LIFE AWAY FROM THIS HOTEL<p>My husband and I first stayed at Crossland Hotel because it came under the Extended Stay Website. The first stay was bad but we decided to give it another change because of the low price and location. However it quickly went from bad to Terrible with warp speed. The rooms wreak of an horrible un-describle odor. The Floors were always stained so badly that i refused to remove my shoes, the Sofa was so nasty I felt if i sat on it i would encounter some sort of bacteria that has no cure, the Bath Tub full of dirty foot print stains, there were no dishes or silverware, the sheets did not fit the bed, the mirror had been removed from the wall and sat on top of the dresser, the refrigerator leaked water all over the floor, I asked for a non-smoking room but the room smelled like a bar, the bed moved from side to side like a sea-saw, the Television was something from Bedrock, the maid attempted to come into the room after the first night (unsure why since she was not scheduled to clean the room and the do not disturb sign was posted). There are prostitutes everywhere looking for customers. Enter and stay at this Hotel at your own risk, but know you have been warned......so be afraid, be very afraid. This Hotel should be destroyed and the property used for a parking lot
Room Tip: If travelers want a good room, run and go to another Hotel
See more room tips</p><br>warning do not stay at this motel<p>I arrived at this hotel on Sunday June the 15th I immediately change my first room that I saw. The room was dirty the bathrooms were dirty and dingy the rooms are very dark, the couch in the front area was soiled and this facility is still using TVs that are 20 years old.
I immediately switched rooms and when I got to the second room it looked exactly the same as the first room both with an old sour smell clearly somebody had smoked in both rooms which I wanted non-smoking rooms and again the bathrooms were dirty.
The place was so bad I didn't even bother checking in on another room I just left.
This place needs a serious renovation. If you were travelling particularly if you have kids this is not a place that I would stay at unless you have no other choice or need to stay in this immediate area. Stay away.</p><br>Las Vegas Crossland Economy Suites Boulder Hwy<p>YUK! SCARY! Room was dirty and old and stained furniture, Got the ironing board out to use and it broke right in half. NO hangers in the room. HUGE spiders on the wall in the middle of the night!!! Would never stay there again.</p><br>Would stay here again<p>We stayed 9 nights at Crossland and found it to be clean and convenient. The room was clean and in good shape when we checked in. There's a stove with an oven, also a full size refrigerator and a microwave. Everything worked fine. They don't have housekeeping service every day, but they do clean the room after a week and you can replace your towels at the front desk at any time. They furnished 2 each of plates, bowls, cups, glasses, spoons, forks, knifes. There was only one pan (a fry pan). There was a toaster and coffee maker.

There was a table with two chairs and also a comfortable sofa. The king size bed was really comfortable. They provided a dresser and there's also a walk in closet so we had plenty of room for our stuff.

The TV was an older model but had a large screen and worked fine. There are only 25 channels (5 of them are ESPN). There were two Showtime channels.

Our only complaint was the internet connection. WiFi is free but since it didn't seem to work that well, we opted to pay an extra $14.99 per week for faster internet service. We were disappointed because it was fast when it worked, but we kept losing the internet connection. We spent a couple of hours on the phone with their tech support service but they weren't able to get it to stop kicking us off the internet.

There's a really pleasant courtyard between the two buildings. It has lots of shade trees, a couple of tables and chairs and a gas BBQ. One of the other guests was not familiar with lighting the BBQ but one of the staff responded quickly to help her get it lit.

There's a swimming pool, but the weather wasn't quite warm enough for me to try. Several other guests did us the pool and seemed to enjoy it.

This was the second time we've stayed at Crossland. We also spent 3 weeks last year. I'd definitely stay again.</p><br>Worst place ever<p>First off the Smell in the Room was horrendous and smelled musty and like cigarette smoke. The smell in the room aggravated my asthma and made it hard to breathe.
Second, I went to flush the toilet for the first time and it backed up. The hotel staff at front desk came to try to plunge the toilet and it kept overflowing the more she plunged, I Had to tell the staff to Turn the water valve off to stop the water because she did not know. They should of sent out maintenance but instead the check in clerk came to the room to plunge it. They did not mop the floor with cleaner after it flooded over they just cleaned up the water.
Then we came back from our dinner and went to bed. We itched all night and did not know why. We did our check out in the morning and left. Later on we both discovered bug bites on myself and my fiancee from being under the covers of the bed. The room had old carpet , the coffee table was broken and wobbly. The room was so muggy and smelly. The fan that they had in the wall to help move the air conditioning air was all dusty and dirty. I have never stayed at a place so bad before in my life.

I asked if we could get another room when we got back from dinner and they told us no because the hotel was booked. I then asked if I could get a refund and they refused the refund because we had been checked in the room. We were only there for only 1 1/2 hours before we went to dinner . I Paid Cash for my Visit and was very upset that they would not refund my money so I could go somewhere else. I felt forced to stay there or loose my money. I was so upset about it that I ended up at the Valley Hospital later that night from an Anxiety attack caused by this hotel stay.
Room Tip: Stay away from this hotel period.

I am not a neat freak by any means, but the place was disgusting. There were hairs on our sheets. The bathtub was half full of dirty water. The bathroom sink had toothpaste dried all over it. There was animal urine all over the carpets. There were dirty black hand prints on the white kitchen cabinets. We couldn't use any of the dishes because they were all dirty. There were no sheets or pillows for the hide-a-bed. We asked the front desk for some and they told us they didn't provide those. The chandelier in the room was COVERED in dust. Seriously it must not have been cleaned in at least a couple years. I took my daughter to the pool so she could go swimming, while my husband figured out another place to stay.. But the pool couldn't be used because it was full of garbage bags and newspapers. It's in a horrible neighborhood. My husband was harassed by a "pimp" trying to sell his girls. The final straw was when I seen a cockroach crawl across my 1 year old. I called the office to tell them what was going on and they were extremely rude. (When I first checked in I paid cash for 2 days. It was $286 with tax for both nights.) They refused to come clean anything or refund my money. I waited until the next day when i was told the manager would be in and went back to speak with the her. Her name was Leslie Ann. She was extremely rude. She called me a liar and said the room was completely clean. I asked her to come look at the room to see and she flat out refused, saying her housekeepers cleaned it. I even tried to show her a picture of the cockroach I took with my phone and she refused to look at it. I ended up calling the health department to let them know about the dirtiness. I'm also trying to get in touch with corporate to let them know. Horrible Horrible place with AWFUL customer service. Needless to say I wouldn't recommend this place to ANYONE!
Room Tip: Stay somewhere else!
