<html><head><h3>Crossland Economy Studios - Las Vegas - Boulder Highway Hotel Reviews Page 5</h3></head><body><br>I would come back again when ever I'm in las vegas<p>excellent palce to stay and I love this place and I didn't want to leave,but I have to. Keep up a good jobs</p><br>Read the reviews for years--nothing has changed.<p>Dangerous!!! WiFi sucks. Internet connection extremely slow or won't connect. Lots of signs of hard-core violence. Doors and windows smashed in. Cars in parking lot windows smashed, parts missing. NO SECURITY. Only place I've seen in Vegas where there was no security and gang bangers seem to be taking advantage of this. Some undesirable guests, pimps and prostitutes and gang members. Heavy smoking in walkways and stairways. HOT! Noisy. Pets/urine smell. Bad odors. Pool was dirty. Expensive for what you get. Separate bedroom/bath is nice with kitchenette and livingroom. But no security, WiFi or maintenance brings the place down to a "will never again visit" review level. I think the favorable reviews were written by hotel employees. Location is actually good if you want to see all of Vegas, not just the Strip. But it is borderline ghetto. Creepy.</p><br>Bypass this one<p>I stayed as this hotel because I had previously stayed here a few years back with very good service and a nice room.

This time was one of the worst experiences that I have had in a hotel in a very long time! The room air conditioner had not been turned on, and by the time my sister and I checked out the suite was not cool. There was no ice, no coffee pot, none of the things that Extended Stay is known for.

I definately will not stay there again, even though the manager gave me a free night at another extended stay. I will use it some other city!</p><br>The worst experience of your life<p>While staying at this very low budget location make sure you stay clear of the cockroaches. If that is not bad enough make sure you have an itemized list of what you brought as you may leave with less possessions after the housekeepers are done stealing from you. This is the last place you ever want to stay at.and should be condemned.
Room Tip: any room at any other place would be a better

The outside court is relaxing with trees, barb q pits, umbrella tables and chairs. There is a nice fitness room and laundry on site. Its definitely a good deal for the money.</p><br>Horrible and Unclean<p>The air condition did not reach to the bed room ( it filters through a little cut out hole in the wall), it worked very well in the living room. The pull out couch that they mention, did not have a mattress (literally) all that was left was foam and a top covering. The carpet was so badly stained, I did would not walk on it withouot house shoes. When the manager was called (beacuse there is no attendent after 11pm) he stated that well no one else complained and he is 75% full. He gave me another room on my walk to the room, the outside was covered with roaches and crickets. When the pull out bed was pulled out, it had chips on it. I had to kill to two LARGE roaches in the room, there was a dead one in the closet. The coffe pot hadlarge particles covering it. It was a Horrible Stay. During my weekend stay house keeping never came in to clean the room.</p><br>Definatly worth the value of a dollar, all in 1.<p>I was very skeptic when walking up to it , due to its location, but i must say that when walking up to the front desk , i was happily greeted by the front desk clerk. with that said ,it being my first time i was treated with the hospitality of a family member or a resident thats been residing there for a long time.
Now on the terms of management, there very helpful, i actually had to remember his name , which was Eric, he has excellemt custumer service. Anything you needed or asked for he made sure u got it or did his best to make sure it happened.

As far as the rooms go, it actually exceeded my epectations. There was everything you could possibly need in there, from towels to pots to the conveniance of the hide -away bed . Its in a great location, not to far from everything.
On a scale of 10 , i definately give it a 9. thanks for everything!</p><br>OK, but far from the Strip due to detour<p>We got a room here for New Year's Eve celebration. It does not look too far from the Strip on the map, but you'd have to take a highway to get to the strip, which is about 20-min drive. If you plan on drinking, park your car at a hotel and get a cab. Due to the distance and heavy traffic near the Strip, you may end up paying $30-$40 for a cab one-way, so you're really not saving much money. We paid $75 for a king bed. But add the cab fares and the 2-hour-wait for a cab (cabs in Vegas cannot be flagged, reservations or pick-ups at casino hotels are required), we might as well pay a bit more to stay on the Strip and avoid the hassle. The room is big, but has a strange layout. The room is divided into two sections, the first with just the bed and a small bathroom while the second is the couch, TV and a kitchen. We like to watch tv when we go to bed and this was an inconvenience to us as the TV could not be moved. The pull-out couch was filthy and has obviously not been cleaned for months. I would not sleep there unless you wanna get bed bug bites. The hotel staff was NOT helpful at all. I dialed 0 and asked them if they could get us a number for a cab company and they did not even do that! They said we would have to come to the lobby and look up the yellow book ourselves. In other words, customer service was non-existent.</p><br>Good stay for the money<p>This hotel is a good value, and is perfect for people with pets since they allow pets in the rooms for an additional fee. :-)

It's your average hotel accommodations, with cheap internet access, a pool, and laundry facilities. It's way off the strip, so you have to drive everywhere you go, but if you have a car, it's nice to be away from the madness. And Boulder Station is right down the street and has all the good stuff that any of the other casinos have.</p><br>Huge Rooms<p>I was extremely happy with the room provided to us. In our trip this was the only place, where we got a seperate living and bedroom. The staff was ok. Had internet access. Clean room. No issues</p><br></body></html>
