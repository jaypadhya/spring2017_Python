<html><head><h3>Crossland Economy Studios - Las Vegas - Boulder Highway Hotel Reviews Page 4</h3></head><body><br>Wonderful People<p>We have been here for 1 1/2 months and have been very pleased with our stay. The employees are wonderful. They are all very pleasant and accommodating. We really have felt like this has been our home away from home. The rooms are spacious one bedrooms with a walk in closet. The area is convenient to many attractions and stores. When we return will will stay here.
Room Tip: We opted for a non courtyard room because of our dog, but the courtyard and pool area are very nice...

There are two separate buildings, one has smaller rooms, the other has suites. I got a great rate due to the length of my stay and it was worth every penny.
The suite was as big as an apartment, had a full size fridge and FOUR burner stove... WITH an oven. Nothing helps you feel at home like the ability to cook a real meal. Plenty of cabinet space and a walk in closet.
No, it isn't right off the strip. If you want to experience Vegas, you gotta get off the main drag. There are plenty of casinos with great "Vegas" meal prices. On the strip, they have you, the prices are higher than you'd expect. Out away from the strip, they are trying to attract you.
The Extended Stay is near food, shopping and great views. Give it a shot, I think you will be pleasantly surprised.</p><br>Comfortable place to visit<p>This place was a home away from home, It had all the things that we have at home. Although the pool wasnt sparkly clean we still enjoyed it. My (4) learned how to swim in 2 days.So, I;m happy ..Thanks EXTENDED STAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Room Tip: The bed was soft and comfy! Almost like a memory foam............Nice kitchen to cook in and they pr...

Quiet, comfortable, relaxing and great location.</p><br>Stay at Extended Stay on Boulder Hy Las Vegas<p>I have stayed at this hotel many times and I have always enjoyed my stay there. I found the staff helpful and friendly. When I needed help when locked out of my room I was promptly helped by a staff member. I was very satisfied with my staythere.</p><br>This place should be condemned<p>I booked my annual trip to Vegas in advance as always. I was born and raised in Vegas so I know the city very well. The hotel was falsely advertised and I want all my money back. My room smelled of smoke. The entire room was filty. Tub and walls of shower dirty, toilet not stable, sink clogged in kitchen, no towels, no dishes, no pans, fridge filthy, microwave filty, stove filty and only 2 burners work. Gym unusable, property filthy, trash, condoms, animals all over the place. Oh did I mention that there is no security, prostitutes and pimps live and do their business right in frount of the office. Drug transactions and prostitution happen nonstop right in frount of your face. Phone does not work in room. Front desk offered to transfer me to another room but all the rooms I looked at we're in worse condition. I have been driving up and down the boulder strip trying to get another room but have had no success. I am in town for another week I am so uncomfortable and scared. There are roaches and the maid never shows up to clean anything. I am about to go see if I can get a toilet brush, mop and broom from the front office to clean my own room, just as I did when I first arrived. This is so disgusting and my vacation is ruined!! I told the frount desk that the rooms should always be inspected before allowing a guest to move in and that the property was not fit for taking in guest. I have never stayed at an extended stay this low class. I will never stay at any of their properties again. Looks like I'm trapped here until April 8th. HELP!

Forgot to mention I was offered a 1 night comp. REALLY! I would like all my money back so that I can go get me another place for me and my family to stay.
Room Tip: I trusted the property because of the extended stay name attacked to it. I also called the property...
See more room tips</p><br>I would recommend looking elsewere<p>Not very clean, I will deffinatly not be back, rooms are old and dirty.</p><br>Better value elsewhere<p>I paid $47 for a place to stay with many problems. I paid $41 for the Day's Inn on West Tropicana a few nights earlier and had a much better experience, including a hot breakfast at Denny's next door.

Obviously a discount place (which should charge less than $30), but they could show a tiny bit of pride. The carpet was indeed filthy, and there were no overhead lights and no working lightbulbs in the bedroom. The telephone did not work for calling the front desk; it rang, but nobody could be heard on the other end. The microwave is tiny with no rotating tray. Nothing has been updated, apparently, since the 1970s. They obviously knew about these problems before I checked in, but did nothing about them. Not even an apology for giving me a room in such conditions.

The best thing I can say is that the bed was comfortable, and the locks on the door worked. So it was a place to sleep and take a shower (with a shower head that was loose and could not be directed). They do have bare minimum dishes, pans, and utensils for 2 people. The noisy heater does work. The wireless Internet worked surprisingly well. The friendly staff told me they would check out the telephone and the lightbulbs, but I wonder if they tell everybody the same story.

For $6 less, you get so much more elsewhere.</p><br>A good value for the price<p>I didn't have a great stay but it wasn't bad either. My room was clean, the bed was comfortable and I felt I got a good value for the price. I had several concerns... I was on the third floor and I couldn't find an elevator. They may not have one. I also only had a single roll of toilet paper and it was half gone. The hotel is dated and could use a refreshing. Coffee maker in room but no coffee - maybe they don't provide that with these long-term stay hotels. I only stayed one night so I missed the coffee in my room.
Room Tip: Ask for a ground floor room.
See more room tips</p><br>Basic and Functional... Good Price<p>Basic extended-stay style property located along Boulder Highway north of Flamingo Road. Two room suite included a large but somewhat sparsely furnished living / kitchenette room and a separate bedroom with double bed and dresser. Unlike many extended stay properties, the kitchenette included a full stove with conventional oven. There was also a microwave and refrigerator. No other amenities (such as alarm clock or bathroom amenities). Room condition was average - a bit drab and threadbare but certainly serviceable and clean. The climate control unit worked fine. Internet access costs extra; I did not use the hotel provided service since I carry my own wi-fi hotspot. Bed was comfortable. Overall, not a bad place if all you're looking for is functionality and a decent night's sleep. For extended stays, the room size and the well equipped kitchen would be a plus. Note that this property is a fair distance from the airport so allow yourself extra time if you travel to or from the airport during busy periods.</p><br></body></html>
