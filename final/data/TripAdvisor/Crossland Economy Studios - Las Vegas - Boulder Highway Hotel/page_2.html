Febreeze didn't work on it. The air conditioner had a death rattle going on. parking lot is hard to maneuver through. Not a good place to take your children.</p><br>Bad experience stay away<p>There is NO MAID SERVICE unless you stay for more than seven days. And then you only get service once a week. We stayed 5 days. They do not tell you this before you book. When we got there in the first few minutes of walking into the room we found that the frame for the bed was installed backwards therefore the frame stuck out over six in just waiting for an ankle to hurt. The lamp next to the bed on the wall was broken and hanging there by the wires. The kitchen sink was plugged. The freezer worked but the refrigerator did not. The remote for the TV did not work. So I went to the phone to call to the front desk to let them know but the phone did not work so I had to go down to the front desk to let them know. When I went to take a shower there was only 1 bath towel which was used by my partner so I had to dry off with a hand towel. To get clean towels or linens you have to take your dirty ones down to the front desk to exchange for clean. Then you have to go back and put the sheets on yourself. Just what I wanted to do on vacation. The maid tried to enter while we were there. We told her we were leaving in a few minutes. We looked at each other and said wow I guess we are getting maid service after all. But when we returned hours later nothing was done. I went to the front desk (because I could not cal) and asked what business their maid had coming into our room if she was not going to service the room. They did not have an answer for me. Nothing was missing but you see my point. Any trash we had we had to take down to the dumpster. The carpets were stained and dirty. The final straw was when I had to go to the front desk to get toilet paper. The water in the bathroom sink and shower were reversed, the hot was the cold and the cold was the hot. I found that out when I was in the shower. There was no dresser or anything to put your suit case on so you had to leave everything in your suit case because putting anything on the rug was out of the question because it was so dirty. When I complained the gal at the front desk told me she did not like my attitude.</p><br>Not for family.<p>If you have young children stay away from this meth house. We had to cover the couch in towels because it was sticky,I just need up banning everybody from sitting on the couch as the floor was slightly better. No sheets on the pull out bed and when asking for them, they weren't sure if the you had any... I did get some but they were 2 small.

Ontop of all this, you will have hookers walking around the area at night, AND YES there was a freshly used condom in the bushes the next morning. We also experienced a topless woman strung out on drugs yelling at some guy and then quickly going back inside.

Yes, it was a night to remember, I'm sure you can find more luxury for an extra $10 to $20 a night. Or at least have fitting bed sheets without the burn holes in them.</p><br>regret this stay<p>The first room we got smelled so bad of smoke we had to move. We got moved to a room in the back and the entire place looks really ghetto I was afraid my car would get broken in to. Ghetto aside, the new room didnt smell as bad but not much better. The stove was broken, the microwave didnt work, the bed was hard and had what looked like a blood stain dripping down the side of the matress. Room was not clean in general. In addition, checking out was not pleasant either. I felt rushed. Check out is at 11am. The housekeeper came at 9:30 and said she was told we checked out already. We got a call at 10:30 letting us know that check out is at 11 ans ANOTHER call at 10:55 AGAIN informing us that it was now 11 and we need to check out. I was annoyed at that point so I told her yes I know this is the 3rd time we are being told, I feel rushed. Then instead of apologizing she said well I need to get the cleaners in the room. So to sum it up. Dirty and broken room with rude service.</p><br>No WORDS<p>With Crossland, I encountered countless issues, bugs creeping in, linen stains, dents and holes in walls and furniture, missing sink stopper, grease/grime(kitchen), filthy toaster, odorous room, found undergarments behind bdr dresser, sleeper sofa had trash behind it, the garbage can & bags had coffee stains and constant noise disturbances from other tenants(above). I contacted ESA’s customer service line and reported this disgrace and then to the office’s management. I was offered another room, but the upgrade wasn’t that at all, because of issues such as filthy toaster, stove top burner didn’t work, bathroom sink pipe leaks, dresser without knob, grease/grime(kitchen), linen(stains), replacement linen(stains), bathroom tub(stained/dirty) and constant noise disturbances from other tenants through wee hours of the morning with. Kids constantly running around on the balconies. People outside all wee hours talking loud and playing music.The exterior grounds of the property were unsanitary; full of old clothes, food, trash and pet feces. The patio furniture were covered in stains and the hotel’s pool did not have a filter. I also began to realize that Management/Maintenance does not operate all hours, so basically there’s no one to contact in case of emergency. I tried to contact management during late hours to complain about one of those noise disturbances and no answer. Another occasion where I had contacted the mgmt office at around 5pm one evening because my microwave was malfunctioning. She stated to me, that maintenance had already *clocked out* and that my request would have to wait til morning. I thought to myself, “What kind of establishment is ESA running?” Is this the kind of treatment that tourists/clients/newly residents endure during a hotel Extended Stay America (ESA)? A place that doesn’t offer comfort/quiet/safety/customer service...which is what I definitely didn't feel at either of your establishments. Whilst moving in, I felt totally unsafe, cause other tenants were watching me the entire time. I also had an issue with another tenant who was constantly following me every time I would step outside and because I was alone, I was very uncomfortable and I wasn't aware of this man's identity.
Room Tip: Just Don't Go!!!
See more room tips</p><br>Pleasantly Surprised<p>I got a very good deal on this hotel on Priceline and while it's not in the best area it is fine and was certainly safe. The room had no big frills but had everything I needed and was definitely a spacious 1 bedroom suite. The wi fi was free but just a bit slow though quite serviceable. There was a good table to work at with a plug near. The staff was very friendly and it was quiet. It took me about 10 or 15 minutes to get to the Strip and since all the parking on the strip is free the drive is fine. They are pet friendly and the pool seemed nice. I would stay here again.
Room Tip: Get a room on the inside courtyard.
See more room tips</p><br>Cheap accomodation - but it shows<p>The fridge, range and microwave worked, and there were plates and silverware. Although large, the rooms were spartan and looked tired and dingy, the furniture showed signs of wear and tear; it was scratched and the wood was nicked.The sofa had a large stain at one end. The curtains in the bedroom were different lengths. The place needs a bit of TLC. Certainly not the place for a romantic weekend. However, I was just out there to play golf and was looking for cheap accommodation so it suited me fine.</p><br>Great to escape the heat<p>My son and I stayed here a night since it was the cheapest I could find on Priceline near us and we didn't want to camp as planned because of the record heat they were having. I was expecting a pretty shabby place given the price, but it really was much nicer than expected. My only real complaint was it took forever to cool down but it was pretty darn hot outside. Desk staff were very friendly (and American). Wifi worked fine for me as-is. Since they are studios we could have cooked dinner as well but we had just eaten out before arriving. The second bed is a fold-out sofa in the kitchen room. The motel sits on the west side of the divided road so you need to go past it and make a u-turn (hoped those were legal) at the next light if you're headed north.</p><br>VERY NICE<p>We arrived early before check in time. The lady at the front desk was nice enough to have them clean our room first so we could check in early.
We are very impressed with the room. It is the one bedroom studio. Very large. Could service four people with out a problem.
Has a very nice pool.
Price was VERY reasonable.
We have a handicapped first floor room.
Far enough from the hustle and bustle but just a few blocks away from sams town and other casinos.
Highly recommend.
Room Tip: would recommend first floor no elevator
See more room tips</p><br>Not bad for $50<p>Check in person was very pleasant. Room was clean, except for toilet which leaked from fresh water inlet when flushed. TV was small tube type but ad good pic. Says free Internet but to get any speed have to pay $3 in room. I also got booted off had had to speak with tech support to get back on.
Room Tip: No restaurant. Movie theater and food very close
