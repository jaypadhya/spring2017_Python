<html><head><h3>Claremont Hotel Las Vegas Reviews Page 2</h3></head><body><br>Rock'n'Roll Half Marathon Las Vegas<p>The Claremont is a okay hotel. It is withing walking distance to the strip of Las Vegas. I stayed here for the Las Vegas Rock'n'Roll Half Marathon. The room is what you pay for. It was quiet and had coffee for the guest in the morning. I would stay again if I go back</p><br>Bad Idea<p>I chose to stay here instead of sleeping in my car at the air port long term parking, bad idea. Huge mistake. No TV, no mirrors, fake phone, broken items in the room, bottom of the barrel. I even had the "state suite" and it was horrible. If you read this, check your room first and see if anyone is lying...
Room Tip: N/A, the place is bad...

The elevator worked only about half the time, and when it did it had a teeth-flossing device on the floor. Room keys worked sometimes, not others. Furniture looked as if it had been purposely bought to look distressed, with chipped and scratched paint, chipped corners. Internet service was available only in the lobby. The "free" breakfast generally lacked coffee. The hotel was extremely noisy, not helped by an altercation in the parking lot at 5 in the morning. All in all, nothing worked as it should have done.
Room Tip: Hopeless, there are no nice rooms.

No TV in my room. Desk clerk told me there is no TV in many rooms.
Attempted to open the floor to ceiling closet door. If fell towards me. It was not attached.
The great thing was that my car was still there and intact in the morning.
Room Tip: The best room would be at another hotel.
See more room tips</p><br>Stay Away<p>This hotel has got to be the dirtiest hotel I have ever stayed at. If it wasn't for the fact that we arrived so late at night I wouldn't have stayed. The first room we were in was dirty and when I walked in the room, there was a huge cricket on the wall. We left there and got moved to another room. It too was dirty but we didn't see any bugs. The bathroom sink leaked and there was a big puddle in the cupboard under the sink. The drain in the bathtub was rusted, paint on the ceiling in room was peeling, no tv, phone, clock, hair dryer or face clothes provided. All the visible dirt makes for one restless night. I lay in bed trying to figure out how I was getting a shower without my bare feet having to touch the bath tub! I would definitely not recommend and would never return here myself, prefer to stay in the car!!</p><br>Yuck<p>Upon check in we inspected our room amd found it to be unkept. There are no fittes sheets on the beds so we often found ourselves laying on mattress. The shower curtain had a half inch of mildew on like it hadn't been cleaned in months. And when I told the staff rhey handed me a shower curtain and rings and I had to change it myself. Dirty bed linens were piled up in hallway. And to top it off the appliances were lacking as well. No alarm clock to be found, fried. Plugs on the lamp and a tv that made loud popping noises when you watched it.</p><br>Just because it's cheap<p>It is the cheapest hotel I can found when I visited Vegas. I have planned to find the lowest price of the hotel for me and 3 others of my friends. So we decided to stay here. We got about US$ 31/night/nett.
I have been change my room one time, bcause the bathtub was clogged, so We had to move to other room which is the bathtub's work good but the room has no TV.
The bedroom just mess, the bed didn't made up well, and i don't think they did vacuum the floor either.
It's kind of far from the far from the strip, but if you have your own vehicle, it doesn't matter. Otherwise you should take a cab to go.
Room Tip: They have 2 double beds room, its good for 4 people
See more room tips</p><br>Never again!!<p>So we get into our room, no blankets on the bed..had my husband go down and ask them for some, she tells him some rooms get some some don't!! Are you kidding me! The bottom sheet wasn't even a fitted sheet! They had two flat sheets on top of each other and I had burn holes all in my sheets. Then we are checking our room before we check out and my husband finds a pair of panties on the bed in the corner!!! OMG SKANKVILLE!!! This place was HORRIBLE!! Maybe u should raise ur prices long enuff to get ur place up and running in good condition! The photos of this place are so misleading. You can feel the holes in the floor when u walk down the hall. Wall paper comes off the walls...ugh its just disgusting here! I know I said I just needed a place to sleep in Vegas and that was it but DAMN! There is a certain extent! We stayed out of the hotel room on purpose lol!</p><br>Don t DO IT!<p>I booked two rooms for myself, daughter and two year grandson. My room: the door would not open with the lamp turning green ( you had to put your shoulder into it like a ram every-time) didn't have one hanger for clothing, the tub and face bowl both stopped up, and dripped, no remote for 80's type tv (called front desk and asked for one (they hung up on me) I asked for king size beds for both rooms got 2 queens size box springs with double tops each room the same. the floor was gritty. My daughter's room had sand on blankets of one bed (no mattress covers on any) ooh and there was a bullet hole in the window. When I bought up the door business to the Saturday morning 10am youngster female member she didn't seem concerned just replied "You want to check out?" Now where would I even had found rooms on a Sat short noticed? This place is worst then the Bates Hotel....."Don't book here!!
Room Tip: Freeway next to this location too much noise
