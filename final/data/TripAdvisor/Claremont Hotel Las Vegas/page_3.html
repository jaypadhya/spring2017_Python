<html><head><h3>Claremont Hotel Las Vegas Reviews Page 3</h3></head><body><br>Poor<p>Pros-Very friendly staff.
Cons- WIFI only worked in lobby. We were told this had been the case recently and it wasn't going to be fixed while we were there.
-The TV in our room didn't work. We could either get picture or sound but not both at the same time.
-House keeping came by at 8:30 in the morning knocking on ALL the doors. The walls a very thin we could hear them knocking and asking at each door. So even if we had put a Do Not Disturb sign (which we didn't get in the room, but probably could have gotten one from the front desk) we could still hear them asking everyone else.
-Vending machines didn't work well. The one on our floor took my money without counting it and wouldn't return it. Also no ice machine. The front desk did return my money but it also cost 3$ for a bottle of water.
-"Breakfast" consisted of hot water, coffee, poptarts, and oatmeal packets. No bowls, no spoons. The coffee and water was both out when we went down and the lady behind the desk just mildly said "I need to refill it" but made no move to do so.
We will not be staying here ever again. It is not worth the money we paid, which wasn't a lot. Might as well pay a little bit more for one of the lower end hotels on the Strip.</p><br>A great hotel<p>i liked it very much
it was great and near the strip
if you can walk 30 minutes thats a great place to stay at
it was awsome very clean and organized and the staff was very helpful
i highly reccomend staying here</p><br>Nightmare<p>The front desk was kind and polite but the rooms are a mess! I use a medical device at night and there were no working electrical outlets in the room. The hotel gave us another room. There were working outlets and a frig that worked. However it was dirty. The bathroom was not clean, I won't go into detail. The hair dryer did not work. The "maid service" consists of leaving new towels but beds are not made, bathrooms are not cleaned, new toiletries are not provided. The "breakfast" is almost nonexistent. When we saw the completely empty counter and asked about breakfast we were told they would "freshen it up". They gave us 3 Capri Sun punch pouches and put out some Pop tarts. My advice: Spend a few more bucks and have a much better experience.</p><br>Low price alternative<p>We checked in ok the pillows were dirty they didnt service our room when we told the house keeper 1 hour they never came back.. not even the next day. Right next to the freeway. No sign we got lost... wifi not working.. small bathtub. Its one of those hotels where people live at.. is it my fault for booking in a hurry. ? No.. a hotel should be an awesome experience. Not a place for families. Its next to all the strip clubs. I even asked for an iron and no luck they didnt have one. Its cheap for a reason</p><br>Horrible experience<p>Let's say it's Saturday night on July 4th weekend and you are going to the bear event next door at the Blue Moon Resort, but the Moon is sold out, as is the Artisan hipster boutique resort on the north side of the Claremont's parking lot.
I was able to book at hotels.com last minute for $45. Lowest listed room rate in Las Vegas for that night. True, you pay in other ways, low rent hookers out front smoking all night long, no plastic or paper cups in room. There is a hotel breakfast which I suppose is more than the coffee you get at Motel 6.
I didn't try the breakfast.
It could be worse. There was a mini fridge and safe in my room and flat screen TV. The weird design ethos of the place seems to come from the Far East sensibility of it's sister property in Singapore, where they shipped the worn out furniture to Las Vegas. You'll survive, I hope. Not as clean as most Motel 6 properties but many more amenities like shampoo and conditioner, but no cups.</p><br>CALL THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT!<p>This place definately needs a health inspection. I stayed there in May 2013.The place is dirty and it smells.The reception said a lot with dried up flowers and debris on the floor followed by the stench in the lift.The receptionist did not let us into our rooms until 3pm on the dot (unless we pay $20 for early check in at 1430 hrs. The furniture in the room was dusty and greasy marks in the toilet. I would recommend hotel hire a housekeeper who cares about cleanliness.
Night time - ground floor was noisy with people walking up and down the corridors. The same people would congregate outside noisy using the fire exist as their entrance as late as 2300hrs. it felt unsafe
Please note it is difficult to get to this hotel using public transport. There is an expressway to the back of the hotel and an industrial complex to the front. Thus you will either need to hire a car or use a taxi for ease.
Room Tip: If you must book this hotel book 1 night only to see what the complaints are about. There are no go...

I quickly walked passed the front desk to the left as it was a horribly uncomfortable situation to watch the manager yelling at some poor employee. As I walked down the hall, there are doors with the door handles completely ripped off and the door wide open to a clear view of the pool...which is about half filled and completely green. I walked the other way and the sign that's supposed to show on the freeway is ripped off and hanging by a thread and about to blow onto the freeway. That was about the time that I'd had enough went to the hospital for a tetanus shot and a full blood screening. If you plan on staying here, I'd suggest you have some VERY good health insurance, and you might want to think about some life insurance too as I was shocked that I wasn't stabbed by a hobo while there. Also, make sure to wear a lot of bug spray because come summer that pool is going to ensure that everyone who stays there gets West Nile Virus.</p><br>stay away from this hotel<p>I recently stayed at this hotel with my family. This place is a dump. The lobby is dirty. The hall floors look like they have not been vacuumed in weeks. One bright side was there was a Front Desk Clerk named Joseph who was trying his best to help me out even though from what I later found out he was only hired a couple days earlier. All the time while his manager was overlooking his shoulder yelling obscenities and insults towards him. After seeing the room and the hotel me and my family decided to just check out and go stay elsewhere.</p><br>DON'T DO IT!!<p>I know money is tight for some travelers, but a cheap place like this should be avoided. I will be brief, stay away from this hotel not worth your money. Location wise was perfect to be near the strip is the only positive thing i can say about this place.</p><br></body></html>
