<html><head><h3>Claremont Hotel Las Vegas Reviews Page 4</h3></head><body><br>The most deplorable place I've ever NOT stayed in<p>This was the worst hotel we have ever experienced in all my many travels. After going 10 rounds with the front desk associate and then the manager on duty, we were stuck paying and we didn't stay! It was so bad, we left and continued our late night drive all the way to our son's in Los Angeles. This place was filthy from head to toe. We should have realized it was terrible just from outward appearances before we went in the front door. Signage outside was gone; umbrella table outside was broken and on the ground; many window curtains on each floor were off their rods and dangling. It looked like an abandoned slum building. The elevator was so dirty, I didn't even want to ride in it. But we went up to our room and found the key didn't work. I thought we were in an old "B" movie when we looked at each other and together, decided it was time to "Get out of Dodge!" Had we stayed, I would have been afraid to eat their continental breakfast the next morning. We could have stayed on the Las Vegas strip for a comparable price, but we wanted to get a short distance away from the hub-bub of the Strip. It was only a couple of blocks but a world away from anything else in the area. Do NOT book a stay here. If anyone writes a good review, they must be Claremont employees or the owner. That would not be a review from one of their hotel guests. This hotel should not be allowed to be on reputable sites like Expedia and Tripadvisor needs to evaluate this hotel. I was very disappointed to see the Tripadvisor sticker on their filthy front window.</p><br>HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HOTEL!!!!<p>First of all I got here at 11pm and my room was not ready. I had to wait TWO hours for a room to be cleaned! Manager has the worst customer service ever! Every single customer there was complaining about the 2 hour wait to get their room. We finally walked into our DIRTY SMELLY room at about 1:45am! Carpet was discusting, restroom was even more discusting! Overall the WORST EXPERIENCE EVER! Horrible location as well! I would rather stay at a brothel than here again! Not to mention I decided to get a soda from their vending machine, took one quick swig and immediately spit it back out! Turns out the expiration date was 2011!!!!!!
Room Tip: rooms are disgusting!!!

Lets just say Thailands "guest houses" (hostels) were 1200000000000x better than this hole. First of all location is HORRIBLE and thats unfortunately the best part. After a 12 hour drive we finally pulled into this dump. Exhausted, we find out that Orbitz has over booked us at this hotel. The receptionist was no help, stoned and did nothing to help us. Said it wasnt her fault and we have to deal with orbitz. With no phone we decide to ask to hook up to their wifi....Oh but thats broken to...and then we ask her what she can do to help us or if we need anything for proof so we could get our money back and she simply says she doesnt know and walks away. We stood there strandad. So long story short we call orbitz (to get a refund) the next day and they call this Claremont hotel back and spoke to the manager who is a liar and told orbitz that they tried to do their best to accomadate us and that we didnt want any of their assistance.....HAHA what a joke. Honestly, I ended up sleeping in a walmart parking lot this night (because Vegas was all booked, surpirse Presidents day weekend and same as the next town over Mesquite) and I am so thankful I slept at the walmart parking lot vs this dump.</p><br>RED ALERT<p>Please Please do not waste a dime of your money to stay here. This is the WORST hotel in the United States. How about 29 degrees outside and no working heater? AND no blankets!! AND they had none to give us. Filthy, smelly and in the ghetto. PLEASE DO NOT STAY HERE IT IS NASTY!!!
Room Tip: Hope it has burned down

Locks on doors were a nightmare, several bad experiences. Had to break in my room a few times. No one can really help u here..3 GMs in the last 90 days. The new one acts like he's busting his butt to do things right but eventually blames all things on "corporate" or the absentee(Singapore) owner. First thing is, be prepared to give them a photo copy of ur ID and ur SS number because they are trying to locate and identify criminals.. I called around and only found 1 other hotel that does that. Gives u an idea of who must checkin there. This place is DIRTY- housekeepers are nice but too frazzled and restricted to even vacuum the halls or elevator floor. The only vacuum doesn't work everyday and don't expect housekeeping if u stay over.. Front desk people are not helpful and some even sarcastic! (Maria was great) the GM keeps apologizing but bottom line is the owner isn't interested in the customers! Even ran out of toilet paper for a COUPLE OF DAYS!!!! Had to buy our own and so did a few other guests! Furniture looks homemade and beat up and strange looking. The pool had water but garbage bags floating in it- heard they were going to close it up-check it if u go in the summer. Breakfast is meager and the vending machine up front is always empty. Motel is in a light industrial area with automotive places and strip clubs... No restaurant on property and a very long walk for food or anything. Located right up against I-15 and all the noise that brings! We all got an extremely cheap rate so we stayed here.Only way !!!The pluses are that they have working air conditioners,32" flat screen TV sets and best of all- right next door to the Artisan Boutique Hotel and super fabulous Ultra Lounge!!! I could say a lot more but this is just the basic facts. You can probably get a low rate here and it IS Vegas- but be prepared!</p><br>dirty<p>i feel sorry for the owners who tried to make this place artsy and perhaps 'boutique' style. i have to say, i agree it should have only been 2 or even 1.5 stars. it tried to be updated and trendy. but the painting on the walls sucked and the whole place seemed dirty. the finish on the elevator walls was some kind of gritty artsy texture, but it was also dirty and sticky. there were cigarettte burns on the tub and on the toilet. the bathroom wall had wholes in the plaster and flooring. yuk yuk yuk. we thought it would be find for just being a quick crash for one night, but no. it was yukky.
Room Tip: yukky. you can probably find something better.
See more room tips</p><br>Bad choice<p>Stayed there in December for some days. Their comfort slogan is pure irony. The carpet is full of stains and dirt and actually partly wet. Staff is friendly but spare with help. They can't tell you anything about the strip, buses, where to find a grocery, where to change money and so on. They keep saying "I don't have this information, sorry". You definitely need a car. You can't hike to the strip, even if it looks close on the map. The highway has no sidewalk, so you have to make a big detour. Neighborhood is strange and full of strip clubs. The somewhat of "hotel chief" wasn't even looking at the guests. Something in my room made a terrible loud noise every half an hour. I could not find out what, and sleeping was absolutely impossible. Fortunately i have got another room.</p><br>Disgusting horrible stay far away<p>I was booked here once threw hotwire and besides it being really hard to find and get too by bus it sucked. The inside lobby reminded me of some of those dirty nasty cheap sro hotels in downtown los angeles except worst. Then I got up to my room and it was bar none the worst hotel room that I have ever had to stay at and I say have to stay at because I booked same day reservations threw hotwire and had no choice but to keep them. Now I stayed in dive hotels in my day but even the worst of those was still better than what I got here at clairmont. The hotel room looked as if the furshings where something they picked up out the free section craigs list and the single bed was just a twin bed with the matress of the removed and the frame left there so you know that was at one time another bed in th room. The curtains on the window where falling off and the floor and bed felft so nasty I did not want to sit in them with my clothes off like I like to do in some hotels but this was too nasty. This felt like a place they might paroll you to after you get out of prision.
So I manage to get threw the night out of and into the morning and loojing forward to there breakfast. So I walk in to what is breakfast and reach for the thing that is holding the hard boiled eggs and it looked like it had not been clean in a decade dirt all around it. So I gave up on breakfast and just hurried and got my things together and got out as quickly as I could and usually in hotels if i like to stay right up to the time of check out if there no where I have to be but I was just anxious to get the heck out of there before I cought something. Then on top of this being such a hole of a hotel they want a 100 bucks depsoit on top of price of the room. What in God's name is there to damage in the room the only nice piece of furtinure in the room is the new flat screen looks like stuff from a junkyard. The only thing really close to this hotel is about 15 minutes walking distance is the palace station. The strip and everything else is far enough away you need a car or a bus to get there and getting from the hotel to the bus is about a ten minute walk. Your out of the way the hotel itself is digusting do yourself a favor and do not book here because what the pictures show and what it is really like are light years apart.
I did want to end with the only postive thing I can think of to say about the hotel and that was the lady who helped me find it once I got off and was wondering around looking for it after I got off the bus. Other than that the staff I met in the moring was rude and gave me hassles about giving my depsoit back but he did.</p><br>Beyond Terrible. Disgusting. A dump that should be condemned<p>There is no way on the face of this earth, no possible stretch of the imagination that this hotel could be considered 2 1/2 starts as rated by Expedia. This is not even a one star.

Whoever at Expedia who rated it as 2.5 stars should be tarred and feathered, drawn and quartered and then exiled to Siberia.

The most disgusting hotel I have ever set foot in. If I had not already pre-paid non-refundable, I would have walked out the door within 5 seconds of waling in. My plane was 4 hours late in arriving and I didn't get to the hotel until 11:00 pm, so I really didn't want to change hotels at that late hour. I just wanted to get too sleep.

What's wrong with this hotel? Everything. This is the kind of hotel where drug deals take place. I mean hard core meth and heroin kinds of people are staying there.

The lobby is not air conditioned.

The room numbers are printed on paper and scotch-taped to the door.

The carpet is so badly stained, I couldn't tell what was a stain and what was the real color.

The room is painted dark brown Dark brown!?

The ceiling had been (badly) matched numerous times

The bathroom was so disgusting I wouldn't even brush my teeth in there let alone take a shower. . The wallpaper was peeling. The bathtub was dripping. There was mold non the ceiling. The wall tile must have been installed by a blind chimp. The worst tile job you could imagine.

The carpet in the hall hadn't been vacuumed in weeks. Disgusting.

The view out my ground floor room was a pile of concrete rubble.

The "breakfast room" was down the hall and outside. Again, it was so disgusting I wouldn't dare eat anything other than a prepacked yogurt.

I could go on for pages.

I have been to Las Vegas many times and I never knew this hotel existed. it is down a dark alley right up against the I-15 freeway. I wish I still didn't know it existed.
Room Tip: I'd rather sleep in my car than stay in this dump.
