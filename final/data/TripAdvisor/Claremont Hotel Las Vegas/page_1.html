<html><head><h3>Claremont Hotel Las Vegas Reviews Page 1</h3></head><body><br>This property is permanently closed<p>Due to Freeway off ramp construction, the Claremont Hotel and the adjacent Blue Moon Resort are permanently closed. Probably will be demolished soon. The nearby Artisan is still open. Both properties were shut down quite suddenly by Clark county road authorities or property holders on their behalf in late 2014.</p><br>This place doesn't deserve any stars<p>Booked a room,almost two months ago through Travelocity. Thank God I didn't pay in advance. We booked it there because they accepted cats and it was inexpensive. I called one week ahead to confirm the pet fee amount. I was told a $50 fee and $50 refundable deposit. Upon my arrival, I was told they changed owners a month prior and no longer accept pets. No one said that the week before when I called. There was no apology. The woman (manager?, owner?) showed no sympathy and had a terrible attitude. Here we are in Vegas with no place to stay and a cat in a car carrier in the back seat. My fault for not reading the awful reviews this place has gotten (267 of them) before making the reservation. Fortunately I was able to get in the Motel 6 on Tropicana with no problems. Plus it is 1000 times cleaner and in a better location. The Claremont should be permanently shut down just like all of the other 267 reviews stated. Hate it - Hate it - Hate it. Travelocity will be notified.
Room Tip: Pretend this place doesn't exist.

Razor blades, screw driver, gum, drug parifanalia, duct tape. Used tape to tape the cord of laptop into the only working outlet in the room. Wife was brushing teeth, than I noticed her tooth brush still in our bag. One that was same color as hers was left in room. Hilarious! Elevator is an unbelievable death trap. Emergency phone held together by tape, begging one to question how much it has been used. Guy in the parking lot looking in car windows. Receptionist has 10 minute conversation about nails and hair before helping you. Faucet of bathtub can not be completely turned off, and loudly trickles. Only one working light in room. Epic experience

See more room tips</p><br>This is vegas, you get what you paid for!<p>Wow, if something is too cheap online. You got to believe, you're in for a treat! This only goes to tell me, don't believe the pictures! Or rather, anything looks good in the right light! Let's just say, the price I paid in taxi rides too and from the strip in one day, I could have paid the difference at stayed at a hotel on the strip. Now I know!
Soooo, to pull this hotel apart. Where do I start. I guest, when the taxi driver from the airport had to look it up in his book, should have told me something. None the less, I forged forward, $35 cab ride later. We found the "spot", pulling up to it, I thought, wow, I've hit rock bottom. Okay, looks from the outside can be deceiving. I was able to check in early ( around 10am) for no additional fees. So I count my blessing. The room, reminded me of places you see on tv that charged by the minute! Only one light worked in the room, I figured out why, it looks better in the dark. Before I forget, I almost dislocated my shoulder while attempting to open the room door. Again, all signs from above that I should call it a lost and leave immediately! I went up to the front desk to ask how to get to the monorail ( according to the Travelocity, walking distance). They couldn't begin to tell me. They gave me a phone number to call a taxi from my cell, after waiting for an hour, walked to another nearby hotel to get cab service. $14 to the Mirage. From the mirage $16 because the driver again, did not know how to get there. Like I said, I could have easily saved cab fare and stay on the strip for a higher rate.
Oh before I forget, that night we had someone trying to get in our room. Apparently, the so UN attentive clerk that checked me in, took my CASH and failed to register that the room was occupied. I had the new front desk grilling me, how did I get in the room.....REALLY!!!! I'm so glad that I was in the room at the time....could you imagine!!!
Bottom line.....if it looks too good to be true......it's NOT. PAY THE HIGH PRICES AND STAY IN NAME BRAND CHAINS.......
Room Tip: don't stay here~!
See more room tips</p><br>I'd rather stay in my car!<p>This place is absolutely horrible! I don't even know how they are allowed to stay in business! The outside is sad and pathetic, hasn't been taken care of in years, the lobby and halls are filthy and disgusting, wallpaper peeling off the walls, it smells like something died all through the hotel. The front desk staff is rude, unprofessional, inappropriate, and don't even know how to correctly read their online bookings and apply them to the rooms. When we walked in the staff was sitting there texting on their phone dressed in random fashion jeans and an areopostale shirt bumping rap music. I could't tell if I was at the swap meet or checking into the hotel I had booked online. The staff then proceeded to tell me that I never booked anything for the hotel. Then she asked me where I booked and I told her online. She replies to me with "ohhhhh yeahhh not a good idea" I asked her what was wrong and she told me that the "internet doesn't work so good" and that I should have called them and to not use any website or trip planner i.e.: trivago expedia trip adviser etc. But when I did call them the person who picked up didn't speak english and hung up on me. Half of the rooms in the hotel have CONDEMNED UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE signs on them and they put us in a room right next to one of them. the rooms are filthy, face make up or something all over the bed sheets, filthy old leaking and moldy bathrooms. Their "continental breakfast" consisted of POP TARTS GAS STATION BREADS AND CAPRI SUNS. THE WORST PART OF ALL, they charged me for three nights and after the first night, they kicked me out of the hotel room. I came up to my room the next day into my room (yeah my key card still gave me access to my room) to find out it was a COMPLETELY CLEARED ROOM WITH ALL OF MY PERSONAL BELONGINGS MISSING. I went down to staff to ask where my things had gone and what is going on as they proceeded to tell me that its my fault because I should have known that I was to check out the very next day when I had clearly booked three nights and my BANK STATEMENT CLEARLY REFLECTS THOSE CHARGES. the front desk staff proceeded to argue with me and tell me that there was actually knew record of me ever being there period. (so what I just brok into the hotel, gave myself a key card, and moved my things in without anyone noticing? I probably could have done so at this terrible place!) The staff refused to give me my belongings and show me a break down of what I was charged and what we had both agreed on. I then asked to speak to a manager and they told me that THEY DIDNT HAVE A MANAGER. so what? no one over sees this place? BS. After much arguing the staff finally gave me my stuff back except for the fact that they forgot to give me back over 200 DOLLARS IN CASH AND 300 DOLLARS IN MAKE UP THAT HAD BEEN IN MY BAGS. Yeah, they went through my bags and took those things. I didn't just have it out in the open, they would have had to dig very far through my belongings to find it and turns out they did and took them from me. The staff continued to give me the run around and tell me that there was no boss that I could speak to and being in appropriate by using an excess of profanities to "tell me off". After a while, the staff told me that they won't give me their manager's information because he "WOULDN'T WANT TO WASTE HIS TIME TALKING TO STUPID PEOPLE WHO DONT MATTER LIKE ME". This place is an overall pathetic excuse for an establishment and I'm sure the better business bureau will love to hear all about this!

Furniture would not sell even in a thrift store,worn out mattress. staff does not know difference between a double bed and a queen or king.
Ordered a king ended up with 2 doubles,</p><br>Dont stay there<p>Rude awful had to wait 4 hours to check in. Then when we were able to check in they tried to charge us an extra 30 dollars saying that's the price of the room we booked even though we had a gaurenteed price threw booking .com will never stay there</p><br>This Hotel deserves a -10 rating.<p>If you are adventurous and like to find horrible hotels, then you will not want to miss this one. The night that I stayed, there were numerous guests from Europe or Asia. I just hope that this wasn't the highlight of their visit to America. The room had NO television, NO clock, NO telephone. It did have stained carpet, peeling wall paper and the largest cochroach that I have seen in years. I was so anxious to get away from the hotel in the morning that I left a coat in the room. I tried calling the hotel, but they do not answer their phone which goes to voice mail that isn't set up. They eventually answered an email that I sent to their reservation email address after 3 days. Do yourself a favor and stay away.
Room Tip: Go to the hotel up the street.
See more room tips</p><br>Not worth more than $10 per night<p>Stayed on December 31, 2013 for one night. The hotel looks decent from the outside, lobby is ok but my room was dirty, the faucet of the shower was broken. No way to turn it on unless you travel around with tools. And the celing of the bathroom was discusting, I wonder if the housekeeping people are blind or what. Dont know if all rooms are like that but mine was. Pictures speak for themself</p><br>If your looking for a pet friendly hotel at a low price, try again<p>I picked this hotel for the price and it said it was pet friendly. I tried calling to confirm I was bringing my cat but after calling 3 different times with no answer and no working answering machine I gave up. When I got there the staff was nice enough but slow. Then they told me that they charged a $50 pet fee, (I've never had to pay more than $20 before). So much for getting a deal on the hotel. When I booked on kayak the description said it was newly renovated so I ignore the reviews about the conditions, I was wrong. There was no tv and the furniture in the room was falling apart. I also chose this hotel for the "continental breakfast" that was supposedly from 7-9. I went down at 8 and there was no food in sight so I asked about it. The lady at the desk said she thinks she could find me an oatmeal packet and some hot water. I've stayed other places in Las Vegas for around that price but this was my first time with my cat. Definitely should've realized something was up when I couldn't even get a phone call answered.</p><br></body></html>
