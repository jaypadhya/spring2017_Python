<html><head><h3>Aviation Inn Motel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 1</h3></head><body><br>Good lodging close to the Strip @ L.V.<p>Room has been partially refurbished - bathroom, walls, large screen TV. Bed was comfortable. Maid service was excellent, not problems. Front office was not open when I attempted to check out @ Mon 8:oo AM. Had to come back after having breakfast @ 9:00 AM. Carpet in #204 was stained.</p><br>Good only for early risers only.<p>I did not know when i arrived that night that the hotel is right across the street from the Air Force base runway. At around 6 am you will hear a loud horn song outside that must serve as an alarm for the troops. At 8 am you will be awoken to an earthquake in the form of fighter jets flying right over your head. If you still refuse to get up at about the same time you will hear high school kids constantly yelling at each other over the jets because there is also a bus stop at the hotel. Also, no coffee in the rooms. Furniture was broken. Bathroom wasn't clean enough.</p><br>icky...<p>i accidentally cancelled the hotel i already paid for through another site and they refused to refund me for 2 weeks... since we were leaving in 2 days, i was in a huge pinch... my mom found this one and we booked it because everything else was either really expensive or full... the ladies at the front desk were VERY nice.... it can't be easy to work there... it's in a somewhat seedy area, the hotel itself is old and our room needed new carpet and a new pull out bed very badly... it also reeked of cigarette smoke even though it was listed as non-smoking... it was obvious that a partial remodel had been done.. the kitchenette was nice and had new appliances... there was also a new flat screen tv but instead of removing the old tv cabinet and getting a proper dresser, they just moved it over to be used for clothes storage... the carpet was crusty... seriously bring slippers or leave your socks on... the beds were extremely comfortable though... if you like a somewhat softer bed, this one is heaven... my daughter loved being on the pull out couch bed but i had to ask for sheets for it from the front desk... i also got an extra sheet and blanket because the bedspread was scary and the sheet didn't go all the way down to the end of the mattress on the main bed... it was also obvious that the door had been kicked in at one point or another... this is NOT a glamorous hotel... the fact that they advertise being remodeled is a half truth... i will most likely never stay here again but it wasn't all horrid... the shower and the bed were the best parts... the room really didn't look too bad with the lights off... lol
Room Tip: Bring slippers and some febreeze...

Check in took some time but it was not so bad, because the staff people were really polite and friendly. They gave us renovated room (we did not ask for it) so we were really happy.

The room was really clean and everything was in good condition. We really liked that this hotel was saving energy and used the card system which helped to do it in the rooms. That's nice!

There is Air Force base really close to this hotel. So it is really difficult to say if this place is safe or unsafe. We spent all the day and evening in the City Centre and came back to hotel just for the night. So it was nothing bad about safety.

In conclusion - it was good place for the night!</p><br>A non-casino motel with clean rooms and good prices<p>I'm not sure why some reviews were bad - I liked this place! We stayed overnight while traveling to Oregon, and it was clean, comfortable and reasonable. This location is north of the city/strip, but we were looking for something quiet and without a casino and cigarette smoke. This was the right place!</p><br>a disaster<p>we arrived late at night and the office was closed. the numbers posted were not answered, the manager was incredibly rude. the room was filfthy, the rug was disgusting. Believe me, this is the worst hotel I have ever stayed at.</p><br>Filthy rooms unsafe area<p>I stupidly looked at reviews on Yelp and Google which can be falsified. This place needs to be closed down until they clean it up. Its not good value miles from the strip and considering the state of the place by no means cheap. We were put in a non smoking room. The room stank of cigarette smoke so clearly the non smoking is not enforced. The area is scary and does not feel safe. The carpet was filthy. Do yourself a favor and go with one of the chains at least the room would be clean. Pay a bit more to be closer to the strip and safer. The front desk staff were very nice but it is what it is not much to work with.</p><br>Aviation<p>Had a great stay! The room was clean, the beds were comfortable, and the front desk was very helpful! Would definently stay here again! The pool was a little small but its a great spot away from the strip! Many places to find good restaurants and easy to find the freeway!</p><br>Disappointing Stay<p>Unfortunately, cannot give a good review on this property. Firstly, for anyone who is a tourist and wants to see the Las Vegas Strip etc. this is just too far away from the downtown core. Secondly, our friendly receptionist, although diplomatic, inferred this area is not the safest area to be. Apparently, reception closes at midnight and is unmanned til eight in the morning - for any emergency you can call a number? For the price we paid, with a $100 deposit! we could have probably found something closer to downtown. It is always nice to support smaller, independent establishments, but this one certainly requires some work to get a better rating from us. On the plus side, although the room seemed tired and old, the bedroom and bathroom were clean, and we did get our deposit back! We hope if there is new ownership they can manage to turn this motel around to a place that is comfortable, safe and secure for travelers.</p><br>Dangerous area, room filthy, $200 deposit charged in addition<p>You know you're in a bad part of town when you don't feel safe in the Walmart across the road from the motel... and when the motel charges an extra $200 as a 'security deposit' in case you ... firebomb the room?? There was certainly nothing worth stealing in the room, that's for sure! Given the disgusting state of the carpet etc, and some of the other patrons, we did wonder if our car would still be there in the morning. When my husband asked the receptionist just how bad the area is (given the clear gang activity in the Walmart across the road) she said that no one had been shot there in the last six months!!! Of course it was my own stupid fault for choosing somewhere so cheap, but they really sucked me in with the idea that it was a special offer. There is no way in hell this place could ever have attracted the price they allegedly usually charge. Absolutely not. This is the second worst place I have ever stayed in my life, the worst being an actual prostitute 'hotel' whose sheets had clearly not been washed. Our rooms looked nothing like the ones in their pictures. If there is indeed new management and they want to turn this place around, what they need to do is decide what kind of place it is, and if they expect to attract law-abiding guests, changing a 'security deposit' is going to put people off, because that is just not what normal hotels and motels do. They also need to replace alarmingly stained carpet and bedding, etc. Sorry to give a bad review. I just want to warn others. Definitely not one for a lone female traveller. Had I not been travelling with two strong men I would absolutely not have stayed here.</p><br></body></html>
