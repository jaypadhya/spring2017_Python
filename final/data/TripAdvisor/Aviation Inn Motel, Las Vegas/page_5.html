<html><head><h3>Aviation Inn Motel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 5</h3></head><body><br>Better than expected<p>I was in a bind and needed a place to stay. Without time to prepare or book in advance, it's difficult to find a place to stay on a Saturday night in Las Vegas. The Aviation Inn was the only place in town available that was less than $200/night.

Beggars can't be choosers, so I was prepared for the worst. Aviation Inn is a little worn around the edges. There are stains in the carpets, some paint chipping on the walls. But I was expecting far worse. What I got was a safe, quiet room at a reasonable rate (I see below that someone stated that the doors didn't lock, but I don't know what that's about - the door locked automatically, and could also be locked with a dead bolt and chain from the inside). It didn't smell bad, nothing was leaking. There were ample outlets for me to plug in and recharge my devices. They have free wifi. The bath products provided in the bathroom were excellent quality.

I was most impressed with the front desk staff. They were friendly and helpful and made me feel a lot better about staying there alone.

I would like to say that I would stay there again, but at the same time, I hope that I'm never in a situation again where I would need to stay there. It's not really close to anything but Nellis AFB. I want the real Vegas experience when I'm there, and that means I'll need to stay a lot closer to the Strip or Downtown on future visits.

But thank you for being available and comfortable, Aviation Inn. I appreciate it.</p><br>Hotel was terrible (Run Away Fast)<p>I booked for 2 nights during the Nascar races 2014, only stayed 1. The minute we walked into the room what a bad choice I had made. Grey dingy sheets on the bed, stains on the carpets, tub leaked and had cracks in it, towels had stains on them. Of course, no refunds because they have a 48 hour policy (nor would they let me look at the room before I accepted it). Because of the weekend being busy with nascar they charged me more per night than they had advertised on there building for a weekly rate. Run way fast. Very disappointed.</p><br>Management sucks<p>1st off read the manager's response to the review about the homeless people as a manager she should not have responded that way next it is illegal to give a person a price then change it after its been reserved 3rd she is the meanest most disrespectful person i ever met the rest of the staff are great people especially the 2 maids</p><br>do not stay here<p>so i called hotel to make reservation for june of 2013, guest agent made me two reservations for 70$ a night gave me confermation #'s and sent me comfermation emails.. 20 days later they send me a email saying that they have a big concert in town and that there was a " COMPUTER GLICH" and that they would not be able to HONNOR the rate that they gave me and that they would be so nice to give me a discounted rate of $ 150.00 a night ( reg rate is 160..) and that they were a " FRANCHISE" so they did'nt have too...lol REALLY..ok my sister has worked in hotels for 25yrs and said this was so rediculious that she could'nt believe it. i can't help it if their agent was not informed as to what was going on in the area and gave me a reg night rate , it DOES NOT MEAN THAT THEY CAN JUST GOUGE UP THE RATE TO A GUEST THAT ALREADY HAS RESERVATIONS WITH A CONF..# ..i called customer relations and was told that the hotel will not do what's right and honnor the rate THEY gave me, but that they would be so nice to give me a FREE NIGHT STAY SOMEWHERE ELSE..NO THANK YOU....SHAME ON YOU RED ROOF INN..TERRIBLE TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE..AND I WILL NEVER NEVER STAY @ ONE OF YOUR HOTELS EVER AGAIN AND HOPE OTHERS DO THE SAME...</p><br>Exceeded our expectations!<p>If you are looking for accommodations in Las Vegas that are affordable, clean, quiet and safe, look no further. We lived in Vegas for 7 years and come back every couple of months to visit friends and family as well as to take care of personal business. We wern't looking for glitz and glamor but did want to feel comfortable and safe without spending a fortune.
We've stayed in several "suite style" hotels on S. Boulder and therefore were a bit hesitant about what we might end up with. Even though our business is in the Henderson / SE Vegas area, we will definitely stay here whenever we visit. The staff was great, they were always accommodating and happy to help us with faxes we needed to send as well as copies, etc. The rooms were picked up every day and even though there was no kitchen, there is a small fridge and microwave in the room which was perfect for our needs.
As for the area, there is a good Chinese Restaurant across the street as well as a BBQ restaurant. (They must cater to the NLV Police because there were always a number of them around the place.) We had no problem with that! More satety as far as I'm concerned.
The hotel is located at the entrance to the Nellis Air Force Base so the only drawback I can possibly see would be the noise from the jets during the daytime. We were never there during the day but I'm sure they must fly those jets sometime!
A special thank you to the staff at this hotel!
Room Tip: We requested non-smoking, bottom floor.

It quiet and peaceful at night here and hasnt been any problems at all they do security checks and keep the rift raft out. There is plenty of place to grab a quick bite to eat near by and a Super Walmart across the street. They also have parking for 18 wheelers which is nice that my hubby can bring his truck home when hes in town. We plan on staying here for a while while we decide where we want to go.They have reasonable rates and Free wifi in rooms and free local calls. I cant say enough about the courtous and friendly staff at the front desk and the maintance and housekeeping staff.... Mary John Lynnette and Anetta ty for the friendly feeling and for being so helpful when we need assistance and For Making us feel at Home....</p><br>Splendid service from Mary in the reception<p>Me and my friends stayed one night at this motel upon our return to Norway. The motel is in the outskirt far north in Las Vegas. Distance to the Strip in Las Vegas is about 20 minutes with taxi. You can also take the bus, but it will take you a little bit more time, but then again you will experience more along the way. 3 dollars for a single ticket into the Strip. Taxi around 40 dollars. All in all i have to say that this was a nice hotel, reasonably priced for an overnight. The rooms were newly re-furnished and painted and were very clean. Mary in the reception was very serviceminded and helpful to us. A great employee to have for any motel-chain. Thank you Mary !</p><br>Beautiful room and service<p>We stayed two nights at this hotel, staff was very friendly and the swimming pool was open until midnight and the kids were greatful for that. When we walked into the room we were like wow, they were very nice. It is about 20 minutes from the strip but for the price it was worth it. Love that they are trying to be earth friendly with their energy efficient system. If you are going this is a great place to stay.</p><br>Good for overnight in Vegas<p>This was a nice hotel, reasonably priced for an overnight. The rooms were newly re-furnished and painted and were very clean. I liked their "energy efficient" system for the electric power. The staff was friendly and helpful with restaurant suggestions. We got a paper in the morning (albeit the day's before).

The inn is quite a ways from the strip but we were just there on the way to Reno so we checked in, drove downtown and parked at Caesars and explored the strip and had dinner before returning to the inn for the evening. It was easy access north out of the city.
Room Tip: We stayed on the ground floor, we had a lot of stuff to carry

Maria, at the front desk went out of her way to make dinner reservations for us. One thing we do not understand is why the changed to a RedRoof Inn. We hope the quality of service remains the same, and they do not lower themselves to the RedRoof standards.</p><br></body></html>
