<html><head><h3>Aviation Inn Motel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 2</h3></head><body><br>My stay at Aviation Inn<p>Overall what a pleasant experience. Me and my wife come to Vegas quite often and whenever we do we stay here. They have friendly staff, big screen tv's comfy beds and solid appliances. I strongly recommend Aviation Inn as a go to hotel in Vegas</p><br>Awesome weekly rates!<p>New ownership and management have really turned this place around. Comfortable beds, new large televisions and carpet, clean and spacious rooms, and clean swimming pool. Stayed in a non-smoking room, and in my experience that's not always totally true, however didn't smell any smoke at all.</p><br>Bad neighborhood, doesn't feel safe.<p>I stayed at the Aviation Inn as I was traveling through Las Vegas but did not want to be on the strip. This place is dirty and doesn't feel safe at all. Carpets are torn up and dirty, the room smelled of old cigars even though it was a non smoking room. Outside its a pretty rough neighborhood and there...
More </p><br>Pretty good for what you pay<p>The front desk clerk was polite and helpful. The hotel itself isn't new. The rooms are in average shape. The carpet is dirty. Housecleaning did a nice job making up the room. The price is quite a bit better than the surrounding hotels.</p><br>Wonderful! <p>I stayed in room 115. My room was silent, very nicely appointed and impressive clean. I cannot believe how nice this hotel is for the price. Do not be dissuaded from staying. I have paid $100 a night for significantly less. My recommendation to management, give your house keeper(s) a raise, they deserve it. Lastly, both the lady that checked...
More </p><br>Great place,, unexpected!<p>Really surprised how good this place was, it was great staff, accommodating and rooms were really reasonable for Vegas ($44.00!) Took dogs no problem and free coffee. Relatively close to the main drag if your travelling through or around Vegas and not on the strip.</p><br>Week-long Stay, Happy we Stayed Here.<p>This is your basic motel but with a little more; read to the end. First let me say, the Aviation Inn is one block from the main gate to Nellis Air Force Base, so you may, from time to time, hear the aircraft from the base, but it definitely isnâ€™t problematic. There were four of us renting three rooms. Two...
More </p><br>Last minute Arrival in Las Vegas<p>Well our family arrived quite late 2 hours before 12 am, we started walking in to a variety of hotels , all sold out , by the 10th hotel the clerk finally told us " you won't be getting a room tonight, all hotels close by midnight, they will tell you there booked but we aren't , it's just everyone's...
More </p><br>Nice and quiet place to stay<p>This was our first time to stay there, the staff and all were just great. Also it was very close to I-HOP and you get a discount there when you show them you room key. They also have a large parking lot so we could park our car trailer and unload our show car.</p><br>Good experience, nice size room for the price!<p>After attempting to call for many times early in the morning, drove from the airport and told front desk didn't open till 8am, but after that inconvenience everything else was ok. Room was nice size right next to front desk, bed and pillows were comfortable, nice size flatscreen tv, good ac. I've been to Vegas at least 15-20 times, and...
