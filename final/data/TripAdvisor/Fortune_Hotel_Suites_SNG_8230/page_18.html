<html><head><h3>Fortune Hotel & Suites, Las Vegas Reviews Page 18</h3></head><body><br>Friendly service.<p>We were greeted by name on our late arrival, room was very clean, minor plumbing problem was repaired immediately, breakfast was adequate. No slots was a plus for us. Staff provided us with directions without being asked. Overall the courteous staff made our visit better.</p><br>Good location, free shuttle, decent breakfast, needs improvement otherwise<p>Stayed here one night on arriving in Vegas in Feb. They have a free shuttle to pick you up 24x7 from airport and drop to strip. Location is great and I like that it does not have casino or cigarette smoke. Breakfast was decent though very crowded.

The room we got faced the strip and a parking lot with very noisy motorcycles and this kept us up. Had we known this we would have chosen rooms facing otherside. Toilet seat was dirty and we felt the room was not cleaned well. We just wiped it ourselves instead of making a long walk to front desk in a different building at night.
Room Tip: Avoid rooms with windows towards strip to avoid parking lot noise from motorcycles, etc.

Breakfast was decent but understaffed and the food offerings poorly organized. They ran out of coffee (horrors!) and my wife waited about fifteen minutes for access to the waffle maker.</p><br>Better than expected<p>We needed a one night stay near the airport with a complimentary shuttle. This hotel provided it so we decided to stay here. We did not expect much but we were pleasantly surprised. The front desk personnel was exceptionally friendly and accomodating. The shuttle arrived quickly to pick us up. The trip back to the airport was very efficient as well. The room was average but very clean and comfortable. The complimentary breakfast was FABULOUS. Overall a very nice (but short) stay.</p><br>Quick Las Vegas Visit<p>This was a family time meeting up for a short visit in Vegas. We booked and prepaid through our travel company & were happy with the deal. Clean place and not fancy. The window drape was broken & we told the desk when checking out. They have a really good breakfast with hot, cold & plenty of coffee. They have a shuttle that will drop you at the MGM, Flamingo or Rivera. You would have to walk back or get transportation. We would book there again for such a great price, when we were not in the room except to sleep & clean up.</p><br>Great place would reccomend<p>I enjoyed staying at this hotel. For a start its in a great location. The bus stop is a stones throw away and most importantly the Las Vegas Strip is a mere 10/15minute walk away. You can physically see Caeser's Palace from the Ramada so the 10/15minute walk really isn't that long. My first thought when i walked into the hotel was WOW. It has a huge chandelior and just looked very impressive for, excuse me, but "just" a Ramada. The reception staff were very nice. Our room was located in an additional building out the back where we had to walk across a small parking lot. This wasn't a problem and you must use your key card to gain entry into each building which is good as it made you feel secure. The room itself wasn't as nice as the lobby. There wasn't anything wrong with it, i just assumed it would be a bit nicer having seen the lovely lobby. It was clean, had a fridge and sink, tv etc. The pool was great. It had a pretty fountain in the middle of it and lots of sun loungers. Very refreshing during the 40 degrees weather i experienced! There was a little gym there too which i used and was great. Breakfast was good. I have no complaints about this hotel. It's away from the noise and hustle and bustle of the strip but not too far to be an inconvenience. Did a great Grand Canyon and Hoover Dam day trip too where we got picked up from the hotel by the tour operator. so yeah i'd definately reccomend this hotel!</p><br>Pretty nice<p>This hotel was pretty good. The building and our room were clean, pretty well kept-up, but the water pressure was terrible.
Breakfast was nice, there was a good selection; waffles, eggs, sausage, yogurt, cereal, etc.
It's not too far from the strip, but far enough that there's less traffic, light, and noise.
There was plenty of space for our moving truck.</p><br>OK Place<p>We, 8 of us, stayed at the Ramada Las Vegas from Dec 30th/11 to Jan 5/12. The hotel is a bit run down for a Ramada. I expected more from this chain of hotels. The continental breakfast was awesome and plentiful but get there before 10am because everything is put away at 10am on the dot. The room was very hot and air conditioner took awhile to start working, pillows small and very lumpy, bring your own, hair dryer not working in our room, I always bring my small one, but besides that it was ok for the time we spent in it. The pool wasn't in operation or should I say no one was there to clean it so we didn't use it. Hot tub was usable but no hot, warm bath like. Speaking of bath, it took about 5 mins to get hot water going in the shower. Some guest were using the upstairs sitting area as their private party area on New Years Eve and it was quite disturbing and loud. Complaint to management got nowhere except to say it is New Years Eve. We went out to the strip to celebrate and when we returned to hotel party was still going strong until about 2am when I finally fell asleep. I told management that this is not acceptable for a Ramada hotel and if someone came in off the street for a room they would have left right away the noise was that bad. People had to yell to hear each other over the noise. We would not stay there again when the Westin Hotel is down the street closer to the strip than the Ramada. Shuttle was a bonus for the airport or to visit the strip because the walk was about 1/2 hour from Flamingo Rd to the Strip. We had booked 4 rooms and for the money we spent we would go somewhere's else next time.</p><br>Great price, but you get what you pay for!<p>My first experience, with the hotel shuttle and the charming man at the front desk, was wonderful. Then I got to my room to find that it hadn't been finished by housekeeping. It was sweltering in there, so I turned on the air conditioner. The pillows were piled on the couch and had no pillow cases. No big deal, right? So I just call down and ask for pillow cases. Granted, it's 11:30 at night and I have to get up at 7:00am for a class. I still need to shower before bed. But I wait for the pillow cases. Half an hour later, still no pillow cases, so I call down again. They assure me they're on their way. Twenty more minutes pass before a pillow case shows up. So I finally can go take my shower. I find a large wad of tangled hair on my towel. Not my hair. EeK. Finally manage to crawl into bed at almost 1am to find that the noisy air conditioner hasn't cooled down the room and the sheets were rough and scratchy. Didn't sleep much. So, in the end, don't stay here if you need a good night's sleep. If you wanna party in Vegas, you'll probably be okay. Cheers!</p><br>Extremely Satisfied<p>Well my title says everything. I highly recommend this place. I stayed there Friday, Sat. and Sunday and paid $165 including taxes. No resort fees. While booking from the web I requested a room on the top floor. This is what I got! The front desk actually was very polite and professional. The king bed room was huge with a view of the strip. Everything was clean. The room had a (clean) couch, fridge, coffee-maker, kitchenette, free wifi with fast internet. The TV was not flat and the channels were very limited (about 15) but this was not a issue for me. The room was really quite: no noise from airplanes, no noise from neighbors. The hotel has a free shuttle to the LAS airport. Interestingly, you can reserve the shuttle whenever you want. Just ask for the shuttle 15 min before your departure time and it will be there. The location is not superior but not bad either. It is a 15 min walk to the strip (flamingo area). You may encounter some homeless people asking you for money but this happens almost everywhere in Vegas. There is a strip club close to the hotel but it is small and doesn't really bother anybody. Breakfast was free and awesome. It icluded from the "classic" stuff like donuts, muffins to more fancy stuff like waffles, sausage, omelets, fruits. Breakfast was really good but only available from 6:30 am to 10 am! Closest casino is the Terrible's within 5 min walking. This is a nice casino with not so high minimums. Ellis Island casino is not far away either and they have some good selection of beers.
In summary, for the money I paid this place rocks. It is a very clean hotel, semi-professional, with many free amenities (shuttle, wifi, breakfast). If walking is not a big issue for you then check this place out I think its worth to it.
Room Tip: Ask for a room with view of the strip. I think Building 2 in the hotel is the best for that.
