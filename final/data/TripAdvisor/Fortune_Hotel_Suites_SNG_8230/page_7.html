See more room tips</p><br>I got very good value for my money<p>I only stayed for one night and checked out very early the next morning, so I cannot speak to their breakfast. What I can say is the room rate I paid I probably would not have found elsewhere, with the added bonus that they gave me an airline employee discount which is the only discount they seemed to be honoring at the time. I showed up at the hotel early and without a reservation and the woman at the Front Desk was very polite and helpful. They had no rooms ready for check in, so I went off to explore for a little bit before coming back. I got a room in the main building and I didn't find anything wrong with it other than there being no alarm clock and the hair dryer was an old wall unit with no strength to dry my very long hair. Other than that, I did not experience any of the negatives some of the other reviewers mention, I guess it depends what room you end up in. I had no trouble finding the room. The king size bed was very comfortable. I lounged by the pool in the afternoon, the pool area was very clean. There were no pool towels, but when I saw one of the staff members and mentioned this, they promptly brought some over. There were soda machines by the pool and the first floor. I had rented a car which I probably did not need, as I did not realize they would have picked me up at the airport. The hotel had its own parking area and I found a spot. For a woman traveling by herself, I probably would not walk back to the hotel alone at night, but I experienced no issues staying here. It is not a brand new hotel but it was great value for the money and I would stay here again.</p><br>MY experience<p>When attending my trip to this business we had an amazing stay & this was ensured by the employees . Especially the manager mark , he came up to the room with me and my lady friends and since i was turning 30 he showed us to a good time
Room Tip: Ask The manager Mark for the sugar daddy treatment
See more room tips</p><br>Very inexpensive, and the bed was very comforable.<p>Six guys had our annual guys weekend in Vegas. It was our 15th year. We have been downtown a lot of years. This year we went out on the strip. From the hotel it was 15 minutes out to the strip. It had breakfast with waffles and pancakes, and hard boiled eggs. We saved our money for gambling. It does need some up keeping, but it was clean, and fine with us.</p><br>Gross<p>I stayed for two nights for work in March 2015. There were stains all over the place on the carpet, tape holding the batteries in on the remote, the blow dryer didn't work, and the phone did not work period. It was just awful. I would NOT stay there again ever and definitely would not recommend it.</p><br>Un'Fortune'ate<p>Fortunately I only had to stay for one night. This motel like hotel is a dump. Rooms are old and bathrooms are tiny. I'm not sure if I was clean or more dirty after my shower. Fridge was falling out of its' cubby hole. The bed and pillows were of poor quality.
This hotel needs an update.
Also, I suppose I shouldn't expect much from a 'free breakfast' anywhere in Vegas but their breakfast spread consisted of frozen pancakes, Eggo waffles, hard boiled eggs, and toast. Why even bother?</p><br>Fleas and Rudeness Equals a Horrible Experience<p>Without the fleas, it would have been a nice enough room, but the fleas were crawling all over the counter in the bedroom, and also the bathroom. The front desk clerk moved me, but by the time I discovered the problem, I had quite a bit in the room to move. Even though the security man helped me, it was a lot of work. I felt they could at least have apologized, but did not. I was moved to a different building, and had to move my car as well. The security man showed me where to park. I thought at least this was the end of my ordeal, but it was only the beginning. They called and woke me up at 10pm, and told me to move my car. I explained their person had told me to park there (and the fleas were the reason I had to move in the first place) and I was not going to move it for that reason. He told me to move it or they would have it towed and hung up on me. This was Keenan, the night auditor, a very rude individual to say the least. I went down, and said they had told me to park there. He said "I am not talking to you. I will not argue with you. Move it or you will be asked to leave." I moved the car, then told him I WAS speaking to him and that he was very rude. Expedia and I tried for 2 days to contact Mark, the manager, but were unable to speak with him. Expedia finally gave me a refund, since it was impossible to get a manager on the phone. The day crew apologized to me, and was much nicer, but there is no excuse for the rudeness of Keenan. Obviously he is a night auditor at a dump because that is all he can get with his lousy attitude. The place is also run down and shabby. I did like the day time security man and desk clerk. They should move to nicer hotels. Don't stay here! You can get a better deal at a nicer place.</p><br>Nice Hotel<p>We stayed at the hotel for 3 days and were very pleased with the stay. The staff was very nice and clean the rooms were also in order. It is not far to The Strip - 10 minutes on foot. A good hotel which can be recommended for those wishing to visit the city.

The hotel is a no smoking hotel very nice.

Specilly thanks to the Manager Mark who was more than helpful - if we ever return to LV we will use this hotel again.
Room Tip: We had a room away from the road facing the pool area and there was no noise - nice!
See more room tips</p><br>This sucks!<p>This place is not the one shown in pictures.

This place is like a motel, is two blocks far to Flamingo Hotel, when you get inside, the place is scary, dirty, staff is terrible, don't think in a little smile.

You need to walk 50 mts to the rooms, no signals of stairs or elevator. When you can finally find any one, you have problems with the key for to open it.

Rooms are really darks, dirty, bad smell, you think that you can find any body on bed.

Wi-Fi free is the only good; but for that you have a nice Starbucks crossing the street.</p><br>Disgusted...and disappointed..<p>I booked two rooms on Friday Feb 27th through Expedia..when I showed up at the reservation I was told there was no reservation under my name when I showed him my e- mail confirmation he said there was no reservation and blamed Expedia..I told him to write me a letter stating that there was no reservation for me...then he change he's mind and said he found my reservation..when I finally got the rooms there were dirty and had left over food laying on the floor and table it was a mess....I will never again set foot on that place.</p><br></body></html>
