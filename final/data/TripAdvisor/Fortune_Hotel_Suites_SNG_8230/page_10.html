<html><head><h3>Fortune Hotel & Suites, Las Vegas Reviews Page 10</h3></head><body><br>Ok for an overnight stay when all you want to do is sleep<p>The concierge at the desk was very nice and helpful and this hotel was easy to book online. The price was cheap compared to every other hotel near the airport and it also being a Friday night. The room had two queen size beds which were ok to sleep on, nothing fancy. The room definitely showed its age but was clean enough and the AC worked. The hallway reeked of stale beer and you can tell this hotel has seen better days. However, when all you need to do is fall asleep and get up the first thing in the morning and hit the road, it is not a bad deal.</p><br>It's not that bad!<p>We stayed at the Fortune 28 Sept to 11 October 2014. We booked before looking at the previous reviews on Tripadvisor, so when we read the bad reviews we were not looking forward to our stay. But we were pleasantly surprised. Apart from having a very difficult door that would never open first time (third floor, room 1327) everything else was just okay. It is a rundown building, even so our room and bathroom were clean and serviced well every day. The fridge was a good size. My one biggest complaint is that it did not have coffee/tea facilities in the room, so we bought a kettle, teabags and milk at the local grocery store. Breakfast was provided for those up early enough, we only made it the first morning and there seemed to be a basic choice of food - cereals, fruit juice, eggs and toast. We preferred to eat at the Silver Sevens Casino or Ellis Island, both within walking distance. The staff were pleasant enough, especially the security officer who kept helping us enter our room with the dodgy door. I wouldn't recommend the Fortune to anyone visiting Vegas for the first time, but for us knowing our way around very well it was a cheap option that I would use again.</p><br>terrible<p>They attempted to raise the price by $20 per night, said it was a reservation fee. The breakfast had no eggs, meat, pancakes, or sweet rolls. Could not even qualify as a continental beakfast There were urnine stains on the bathroom floor. Room was not made up after first night stay, Had to request new towels,</p><br>Trike Trip Day 10 &amp; 11<p>The management and staff were very accommodating and friendly and resolved some issues with our room. A/C wasn't working so we had to relocate to another room. A hassle but worth the move to enjoy our stay. From the outside, you would think this place would be highly rated. Unfortunately, the interior is in need of a good rehab. Carpeting is less than eye appealing. The rooms and bedding were comfortable. Don't know what their problem with towels and such but seemed to be in short supply. The pool is beautiful with a fountain but not many use it and most likely that is because it is kept super chilled. Hot tub was nice. Not a casino! We got a good price on the room so we were not to disappointed by the wore out carpeting.

This hotel is ideally located within walking distance of the "strip" and all the major casinos. I would stay here again.</p><br>review<p>Well its a nice looker outside, the room was dirty the floor for sure. Bar sick leaked, no pillow cases, no towels. When talked with the manager, her gave us a new room, cleaner but still a Hassel
. still no pillow cases. clearly the manage needs to be re-trained.
Room Tip: Go elsewere

Sheets were clean and bathroom was clean so we stayed for 1 night. If you are coming to Vegas for vacation this is NOT the experience you want to have. Cheap decorations and old floors (couldn't tell that they had been vacuumed in a while) Overall pretty sketch.</p><br>Great Management Team Service<p>The Fortune Hotel management team was outstanding in helping me with my reservations and taking care of our accommodations during our time. If you need anything from this hotel or want to know any information on this hotel contact the Manager Mark Kunie. He was outstanding in resolving some issues we had with our school district paying for our reservations. Mark and his team did all they could do to make this a very comfortable trip. My basketball team enjoyed the pool the workout center. The breakfast is good, I did wish they had scramble eggs instead of hard boiled, but overall the breakfast was good. The price is very reasonable and if you are looking for a more upscale suite then you need to pay more for that type of hotel. I would stay at the Fortune again because of the great customer service and Mark Kunie...
Room Tip: Contact the manager Mark Kunie and he will take care of your accommodations.

It's right down the street from the strip for those who are interested in that and breakfast was decent. There was a variety of food offered and we had our fill. Bathrooms were clean and the bed was comfortable.

The only complaint I have is the front desk staff is extremely rude. There was a woman working who barely even spoke to me and treated me like an intruder. This is the rudest hotel staff I have come across. Also, the resort fee of $10 is something of a joke. It's not a resort, people, it is a two star hotel. Just another way to bleed money out of idiots who think Vegas is really something special. We were just passing through and even with the resort fee this was the cheapest place to stay.

It was a fine stay but then again, I was not looking for luxury, just a nice bed, hot shower, and free breakfast.</p><br>great place to stay<p>this was the 2nd leg of our trip and this place was great the room was great, near the strip they had a shuttle bus that took you to the strip and that weather was hot but with the air con room it was a blessing the pool was too cold even though it was hot it did heat the pool up then spa was nice after all the walking I want to use the gym but some morning it was close and never opened the breakfast was ok but they had no coffee making machines in the hotel room because there was a starbucks across the road for you to go get your coffee but overall it was great they got us to the airport early for our early flight to san diego will stay there again if we can
Room Tip: I would say if you got kids get a joining room so they can have their own bed having a pre teen he w...
See more room tips</p><br>Uhhhh...<p>Bought a deal for $35 a night. Wouldn't dare pay more. The lobby looked nice, but the real experience began in the elevator with the sewage smell. The hallway smelled of sweat and malt liquor, and my room had shabby curtains with rips and holes all through. Someone elseâ€™s hair was in the bathroom to greet me, and I killed a cockroach about midnight. Cheap, flimsy mattress, funky smelling towels and a hole in the wall where the shower curtain was held up by duct tape. About 8:00 am a man with no ID repeatedly tried to use an old key card to access my room, which was super scary due to the lack of a dead bolt on the door. The front desk said it wasn't maintenance, and the manager told me I should have invited him to breakfast after I complained. The best thing at the Fortune was the free ride to the airport. Creepy.
Room Tip: Don't pay much and don't expect much.
