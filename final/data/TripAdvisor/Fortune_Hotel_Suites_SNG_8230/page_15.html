<html><head><h3>Fortune Hotel & Suites, Las Vegas Reviews Page 15</h3></head><body><br>Never stay here-it is cheap[does not mean less expensive!]<p>Worst hotel I have come across in all my international travel so far. Everything about this hotel is sloppy. Front desk is a nightmare. Problem started soon after booking the room online. They never replied for any number of emails. They promise airport pick up but when you call from airport only a synthesized voice greets you. Most of the shuttle operators refuse to come or have never heard of this hotel. Most of the persons at front desk follow do not smile policy and carry a huge attitude. When I checked in I was directed to my room through a maze of corridors when a simple walk in front of the main building was easier. I asked for a taxi and it never came. When I asked for walking directions between two famous casinos I was told by the 'girl' that she never walked between these two places! And the driver of the so called free shuttle to the strip claimed he never heard of "Monte Carlo Casino" and ended up giving wrong directions after dropping us at MGM. Monte Carlo is right opposite. We always got the impression that hotel could not care whether guests are comfortable or not. Refrigerator in our room never worked throughout our stay. And every complaint was greeted with a shrug and "I can only forward your complaint" answer with out even an apology. Even the manager who was at the desk did not even bother to shrug which otherwise is the standard response in this hotel. Less said the better about amenities in the room. Carpet is dirty and stained, room is not cleaned on regular basis, toiletries and coffee never refilled , the electronic lock in the corridor does not work. You do not even feel safe. If you come back hungry there is no place for a mile or so where you a can have a simple meal. Hotel of course serves only a stale breakfast. We were relieved when we got our only request honored during the stay-a drop back to the airport after waiting for one hour. Nearly missed the flight. But it was a pleasure to get out of the hotel. The hotel made our entire stay in Vegas a nightmare.If you still want to stay here I can only assume that you are the owner or an employee! As a guest never stay even if you are offered a free stay!</p><br>Sloppy service, run-down facility, you get what you pay for<p>It's cheap, I'll give it that. And it's close to the strip. But beware--sloppy front desk (gave us wrong room number to someone else's room) and run-down facility (room #2's ac didn't work), slow service (understaffed and those they have are indifferent and at times, surly). Reasonably clean rooms, but the baths have seen better days and the halls are alarmingly hot and dusty feeling. The elevators are old and clangy. Breakfast was ok--usual toast, cereal, hard-boiled eggs and waffle maker. Waffle maker timer was broken, melon was turning, but, hey, the coffee was good! They tack on a $10 "resort" fee and take a $100 deposit for damages. The rooms have a price list of things they'll charge you if you take it. Must be a spring break type of destination. In September, filled with Europeans, looking for a bargain. And it is a bargain for its location, but, buyer beware, you get what you pay for.
Room Tip: Ask to be in building 1 if possible, otherwise they schlepp you around a dusty, hot parking lot to 2...

The elevators are a nightmare, they make a startling vibrating sound and its very slow it really should be inspected. Also the facility outside the rooms is a complete dump! there was filth inside the ice machine and underneath, mold maybe? it should definitely be cleaned pronto, ew!! and breakfast? forget about it, its very bland, nothing looked appealing what a complete disappointment!!!!! The rooms are way outdated it felt like i was in 1975, old tvs, old furniture. Some of the pictures in the fortune website is misleading, the lounge does not look like the one you saw in the pictures on the website, the bathrooms are very old looking and needs to be caulked. I would have given this hotel a 1 but decided to give it a 2 because the beds were comfortable and i liked how there was a fridge and free wifi. other than that stay away from this hotel. It may not be the worst hotel i have stayed at but this hotel needs a lot of work and work on faster, effective service.
Room Tip: stay clear of this hotel!
See more room tips</p><br>Forget all your apprehensions<p>When I walked into my room, it was an instant relief from the 100 degree heat of Las Vegas, the room was clean and well maintained fantastic A/C. Yes there is a scuff mark here and there in the bathroom, if you get on your knees and look closely at the bathtub, but it is very clean. Beds clean and comfortable, and the staff friendly. Special mention must be made of Ashley, who I class as one of the best Hotel receptionist I have ever met. She struck the PERFECT balance of friendliness and adhering to hotel policy and professionalism.

Generally I was a bit nervous about booking this hotel especially with some of the reviews, citing the area. Forget all of that, the place is not a bad area, yes you find a homeless person now and again walking by, but the hotel is clean, quiet and SAFE. The shuttle from the airport is prompt and friendly. They also dropped me by the Flamingo, to embark on my adventure on the Strip, you have to find you way back, which is understandable, given the size, traffic and the organised chaos the strip is and besides it is really only a 10 minute walk away if you dont use a cab or a bus, one night I walked with my camera in my hand with all to see and I still have my camera.

The only negative of the hotel is the continental breakfast, there was orange Kool Aid for orange juice, the waffles were a bit tasteless and the jam was stale, but the jam was corrected on the second morning.

I came for one night ended up staying two nights, I highly recommend this place for a stay in Las Vegas, and the rate I got was not half bad. Between 30-50 dollars.
Room Tip: The ice machine is on the third floor.
See more room tips</p><br>Nasty place for low class one, slow and rude front desk<p>Will never come back to this one ever, worst experience in life.

I stayed in most hotel in LV, from top class to the lowest, give this no credit, basically it show no value to customer, plus they charge people for a $10 property/resort fee on it.

It is hot when you walk in to the hall, and even hotter when step into your room, you feel exhausted and tired with it already besides of the hour long check in procedure.

Not only that, they put a deposit on cc, if you don't call and ask for they will just intend to keep it. Pure robbery, property take you back to early 80s time, you also gotta wait for room to be checked during check out, what can/will you take for this no value place? SMH</p><br>Fortune Hotel<p>Pros:
1. Jacuzzi
2. Couch
3. Fridge/microwave
4. No smoking
5. Near Tuscany casino & Lawry's prime rib restaurant
6. Exercise room
7. Good rate for labor day weekend
8. Close to strip

Cons:
1. Long line @ 3 pm check in
2. Wasn't told of $100 deposit on credit card. Have to wait for a few days reimbursement
3. Long black hairs in tub & bathroom floor
4. $10 extra to stay an extra 1/2 hour (Mirage valet had lost car keys night before, so had to wait until new car keys were made. Fortune had no sympathy)
5. Radio/alarm clock not working
6. No coffee pot in coffee maker
7. Requested extra pillows, never recieved
8. Elevator loud. Took stairs instead.</p><br>Rude and Hidden Costs<p>This hotel use to be a Ramada. It is in fairly good shape. The shuttle runs on YOUR schedule which is extremely nice. Plus they give a free breakfast. Small but free. BAD POINTS: There is a $10 resort fee after you have paid online...no resort, it has a pool. Make sure you add in this stupid fee for each night you are there. They blame you for not reading the fine print when you book it. Unfortunately I thought the price I booked it for was the price I would pay. They would not let us check in until exactly 3 pm. If you want an extra hour after check out its an extra $10. Finally was able to check into my room and it had not been cleaned. So I had to wait an extra hour before getting to my room. The girl I checked in with was nice, but the girl answering the phones and also running the front desk (Shelly, I think) was so incredibly rude to everyone. I was embarrassed for her!!! She was mean and hateful. Would I stay here again? Only if I couldn't find another place to stay. I cannot get over rudeness or hidden fees.</p><br>Best guess..it's a 'by the hour' hotel!<p>We booked the king jacuzzi suite. We always book king jacuzzi suites so i know what of i speak...
Sounds lovely right...NOT!
The room was dark and dingey. The king bed slumped from years of service; its coverings equally tired and worn. The jacuzzi tub squished in the bathroom beside the toilet. The room smelled musty or musky, I am just not sure which. We could hear the neighboring rooms TV blaring out of scratchy speakers. My husband didnt / wouldnt even set our bags down on the floor while I called the desk to say we would not be staying.
Plus side; lovely check in and check out service with no charge to our credit card. Get with it Fortune Hotel. There is no value at your establishment.</p><br>Ididn't even stay but I highly recommend this place !<p>booked my stay with hotel.com , arrived at the hotel at 3 AM (flew from Toronto so it is 6 am ), was told they are sold out , hotel.com never confirm the booking with them , Mike @ fortune was very patient gave me great tips on how to deal with the situation ,(he said this happens a lot with ppl booking thru hotel.com , looked around the hotel , it does look great , I will definitely come back and stay with fortune .

lesson learn : DO NOT .I repeat.. DO NOT use hotel.com
ever ! unless you want to have kids crying in the rental car tire to dealth and found out at 3am that no room is available for you ..!</p><br>Overall good experience will consider staying here again.<p>My favorite thing about this property is that is smoke free. The rooms are older but clean. The staff was fabulous, very nice, helpful, and efficient.
There were two things that I didn't care for about this property. First you have to pay a $100 deposit that is refunded back to you after they make sure there is no damage to your room. We had no prior knowledge of this when we booked our room. Secondly the air conditioner was off when we walked in our room. This was a major disappointment since we had been walking the strip in 100+ degree weather. So we were not able to come to our room and relax like we had planned. We turned the ac on and ended up going to ride around Vegas a little longer while the room was cooling off. This for my family was a major turn off. I've never been to a hotel in the summer and they not have the ac on for you.</p><br></body></html>
