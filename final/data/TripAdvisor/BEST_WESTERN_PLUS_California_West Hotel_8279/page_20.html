<html><head><h3>BEST WESTERN PLUS Las Vegas West Hotel Reviews Page 20</h3></head><body><br>Here to visit family (but not to get underfoot)<p>For the 3rd time visiting, we were able to get the same room, even. And, Yes, the staff were great to meet again. The pool is ever so comfortable to relax in after a busy day. The exercise room has everything you'd need to de-stress, too. The breakfast buffet is nice, and you also have BurgerKing across the parking lot. For dinner, there is an Outback Restaurant across the parking lot. Great food. Beds are very comfortable, very quiet rooms, even with other families there. The laundry room is very easy to use. Showers were quite refreshing to help overcome the sleepiness. We truly enjoyed ourselves here.
Room Tip: As with all Best Western's you can place requests for type of rooms, floor preferences, etc. Sen...

Had a room on the 3rd floor the first night. Four adults (two 20 year olds and 2 adults). Room was nice enough,clean, nothing special, but it was WAY more affordable than staying on the strip. We had two queen sized beds. Not enough luggage racks for 4 adults with suitcases, but they brought more when asked. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. The 'free' breakfast was good and well stocked. It was 15 miles from the airport and 7 miles from the Strip, so not super convenient if that's what you're looking for. We used it as a base for trips to Death Valley and the Hoover Dam, then headed out to the Grand Canyon and beyond from there. The AC ran constantly and never cooled the room off. I informed the desk when we checked out the first time...no idea if it was fixed since we had a different room on our return. Thank goodness it wasn't super hot weather yet. Return stay was one night and we had a room on the first floor. Not as nice as the upper floor room, a little more 'worn' looking, but still clean and adequate. Has a very nice pool, which we didn't use, and a very small exercise room. Lots of restaurants and stores near by and had a fridge and microwave if you wanted to prepare small meals. Again, the staff was awesome. Overall a nice stay for our needs.</p><br>Great hotel away from the strip<p>We stayed here a week on our first trip to the area. The staff were extremely helpful and the breakfast was excellent. The only thing I'd recommend would be to keep it open until 10 am for guests that want to sleep in a bit. Our room was clean, comfortable and quiet at night.
We had a room on the 3rd floor. The ground floor is actually floor 2 and the first floor was below that, but still seemed to have windows.
We had a car so getting to and from the shows was no problem. Even if I stayed on the strip, I wouldn't want to be without a car. As Meat Loaf said, everything seems close until you start walking.
This hotel is located near a large grocery store and lots of restaurants. It was great to see the hotel is dog friendly.</p><br>Off the strip<p>We stayed here for 4 nights as we wanted easy access to sights not on the strip. The staff were extreamly helpful and pleasant. Excellent breakfast, nice hot tub and pool. Location for us was excellent as we toured around during the day so we didn't have to fight the traffic on the strip. When we did go to the strip it was easy to get to as we had a car. I am not sure how easy it is without a car. Location is very good close to resturants .</p><br>DOG FRIENDLY, CLEAN AND FRIENDLY<p>Las Vegas does not have very many dog friendly hotels. We were very happy to find hotel. We stayed 1 night at the La Quinta INN down the street and checked out due to dirty, smelly and loud rooms. This hotel was clean and had a friendly staff. It is located in a very quiet office complex toward the back of the main street. No pet deposit and very welcoming to our 80 lb chocolate lab. It was about 15 minutes to the strip in a great area. We would recommend and come back again</p><br>Pleasant Stay<p>The stay was very pleasant. Staff is friendly, courteous and efficient. The breakfast was nice to have, so we could eat before getting started for the day. The location is nice, since it is away from the strip and quieter. Plenty of restaurants and shopping close by.</p><br>Trip Advisor<p>Incredible hotel. We would give it a 5 star rating! One of the best Best Western hotels we have stayed at! Beds were great, room was exceptionally clean and quiet. Everything worked properly and staff was great!</p><br>What a surprise!<p>Very nice off the strip hotel! Most pet friendly hotels are not this nice- we were pleasantly surprised! Clean rooms with excellent beds and pillows! Breakfast had nice hot and cold selections and a friendly staff. Very reasonably priced too! Did not mind the drive to the strip as coming back to the best western was a nice QUIET retreat!!! Would definitely stay again!</p><br>Nice room<p>The room was great, the staff was great, even directed us to a good place for dinner. The place was quiet. The down side was the bed, it was hard as a rock. The hot breakfast was more than I thought it would be & the attendant was on top of it all the way. It was very nice!</p><br>Very comfortable hotel<p>Stayed New Year's Eve and everything from check in to check out was fantastic. The front desk man was very helpful and the room was spacious, bed was comfortable (excellent pillows) and shower was adjustable and clean.

Breakfast was outstanding. Biscuits and gravy, eggs, bacon, pastries, waffle machine, fruit, coffee and juice.

We would definitely stay here again if looking for a comfortable off strip hotel away from the noise.</p><br></body></html>
