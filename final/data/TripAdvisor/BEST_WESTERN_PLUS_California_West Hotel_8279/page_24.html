<html><head><h3>BEST WESTERN PLUS Las Vegas West Hotel Reviews Page 24</h3></head><body><br>Great location<p>It's quiet, breakfast is excellent, indoor pool and jacuzzi. Parking is very close to the rooms which minimizes trips back and forth. The key card mag strip is very weak and overly sensitive to cell phones or credit card proximity. We needed to get three replacements during our five days.</p><br>Very clean and comfortable stay, all at an excellent price.<p>I stated here for a couple days for a small vacation. Very quiet and conveniently nearby the Strip. I cannot complain, the service was great as well as the people. Young man at the front desk, Jose Quiroz, was quite charming and helpful. I would definitely come back here on my next trip to Vegas.</p><br>Great location with great service.<p>It was a nice place with a good location really close to the strip. Relaxing room, and a nice pool to also relax in. I also had excellent service, especially from Jose who worked at the front desk. He answered any questions I had and also told me of some excellent places to check out. Would definitely come back.</p><br>Great experience! I will definitely go back!<p>I stayed in this hotel last weekend and I really enjoyed my small vacation. Jose was very patient and willing to answer many questions about Vegas since it was my first time there. I can't wait to go back some time soon! :)</p><br>Very good hospitality<p>I really recommend this hotel to future guest, i went along with my family this past weekend and i have to say it's very clean and people very helpful. A big thanks to the Jose who answered all of our questions and providing efficient service. Great hospitality, I will definitely stay at this hotel on our next visit hopefully next August. Keep the good work up!</p><br>Relaxing in a nice and quite location in the heart of summerlin<p>Stayed here in April. Walked into the hotel lobby with a warm friendly greet. Jose was so friendly to me. He was fast at checking me in. He was also very helpful. Really enjoyed the fresh bake cookies.</p><br>Best Hospitality ++++<p>This hotel is clean, the staff is courteous and helpful but most of all they are accommodating. We had an emergency that made where we needed early check-in and late check-out---NO PROBLEM. The staff especially Jose and Erica put us at ease and brought our stress level way down. The pool and sauna are opened 24 hours and they serve a hot breakfast in the morning. Thanks for great service and a commitment to making a travelers stay a good one.</p><br>I would stay here again and will recommend to friends and family<p>We were looking for a hotel in Northwest Las Vegas and found this jewell of a hotel. We loved our stay here, the staff was more than helpful, the location was quiet and close to amenities, we actually walked to a wonderful restaurant several nights and had great food and service. Very family friendly and stay here again without question.</p><br>Very nice place<p>Handy location about10 minutes from the strip. All accommodations were nice but what is with best westerns a/c units? They are so loud. Sleeping is intermittent all night due the racket. This isn't a problem for just this location. Stayed in 7 best westerns in the last two weeks and the a/c noise has been a problem at each</p><br>Excellent choice for quick easy parking<p>Clean & comfortable stay with decent breakfast- bacon, eggs, biscuit , gravy, made to order Belgian waffles, cereal, yogurt, & good coffee--- all complimentary!

Indoor pool is perfect for family with small kids.

I highly recommend this Best Western for those on roadtrips & looking for a place to rest.

It's about ten mins from the strip which is faster than driving a block on the strip. It was faster to get to the best western than to get out of the parking lot f Bellagio !
Room Tip: Same floor as lobby
