<html><head><h3>BEST WESTERN PLUS Las Vegas West Hotel Reviews Page 10</h3></head><body><br>Location, nice ambiance<p>This hotel is warm, quiet and comfortable. The location makes it easy to head to the Strip or Summerlin areas. There are restaurants, some small casinos and shops (not highend). It doesn't back up to a freeway or major gambling casinos. Small indoor pool and fitness center. Breakfast quite decent with sufficient variety to suit most people.</p><br>BEST WESTERN<p>If i could live in this hotel i would it has everything and the location for me is perfect and the only issue i had only one time and i have stayed here twice was during my last visit at check in it took to long cause desk worker had a issue to deal with and was only one there working at front desk on a Sunday feb 15th 4pm and i think in lasvegas this should be not the case no matter how small you hotel is always have 2 people in the front desk at all times he did greet me but was dealing with a issue.</p><br>Nice nights sleep.<p>The Hotel was the last stop on our 12 day trip so we had a lot to compare. This hotel was one of the better stays. It was clean and up to date. The beds, as usual, were not the best as I am used to a firmer bed, but it was a better firmness than most of the others. The location was away from the city and airport, but this being said we had a reasonable nights sleep. One thing I found throughout the trip was the need to buy your own water. Most cities had disgusting water, this hotel was no exception, so be sure to stock up on bottled water.</p><br>expensive<p>bad parking lot security, hotel unable to provide clear video of thieves. hotel ran professionally, staff was friendly and helpful with the exception of choice of breakfast. room was too expensive for my budget. I would have been better off sleeping in a truck stop and using their showers.</p><br>Cheap and cheerful<p>We stayed here February 10th 2015 as a quick stop while passing through Vegas and found the place to be clean, cheap and full of cheery staff. The room was clean, the TV was in good working order, the bed was comfortable and the breakfast was exactly the fare you'd expect from a Best Western franchise. Bacon, eggs, potatoes, yoghurts, fruits, breads and pastries. A great bolt-hole if you don't want to be in a casino or resort hotel.
One tip: truckers park their rigs in the west parking lot and some of the trucks have refrigerated trailers so the refrigeration unit runs all night. The soundproofing in the rooms is very good but if you're a super light sleeper try to get an east-facing rooms.</p><br>My Recent Stay<p>I had excellent service and the room/bed were very comfortable. It had a refrigerator and tea/coffee which was perfect and the breakfast was excellent. I attended a conference across the street so this was very close and we didn't need to drive in. An early checkout was also possible so when I got up at 3am to leave I didn't need to deal with that. Great trip and stay!</p><br>Check in Surprise<p>This is a very nice BW and I had selected it as it is in a residential quiet area of Las Vegas . I made reservations well in advance of arrival and had checked in a couple of times to make sure all was OK as I am disabled and travel with a caregiver. Upon check in however we were told the room reserved was not available because the previous occupants had not checked out. The place was pretty well booked so we were put in a regular room which was difficult for me. The next day we were moved to the handicapped room originally reserved for us. The manager made a generous adjustment on our three night stay for the inconvenience for which I am most appreciative. I would recommend this BW. Staff was very concerned, caring and helpful and aside from the check in glitch, all went well..</p><br>Best non casino stay ever<p>I stayed here 4 days while visiting my brother and wanting to stay away from the strip. It was well worth the couple extra dollars. The staff were very nice and professional. The room had everything I wanted including all lights that worked, anon noisy heater, and plenty of outlets. The only minor problem was the direction of hot and cold control on the tub was backwards. I reported it and it was fixed that day as nd on a Sunday! If I ever come back to Vegas this is the first place I will stay.
Room Tip: Ask to see your room before making reservation.

Very nice property. Quite clean, but things weren't maybe up to standard because when we stayed they were busy replacing mattresses and carpet.

Beautiful indoor pool and hot tub. Nice little business centre with PCs for us fossils to use. Breakfast was the usual serviceable Holiday Inn standard albeit in a pretty small breakfast room. Lots of restaurants you can walk to, including a great Greek place across the street.

We got up early and had enough time to eat breakfast, go to Red Rock Canyon (maybe 20-minute drive from the hotel), come back and shower before checking out.

One foible.......They have to work on their communication a little. The nice man at the desk assured us the previous night that we could stay until noon instead of 11:00 AM but obviously the message never got through.........the housekeeper tried coming in at 11:15 AM, and then the desk called us to ask if we were staying an extra night. No huge deal, but if it were my business, I would have offered some nominal compensation for this little screw-up.
Room Tip: Always ask for a top-floor room in a woodframe hotel like this one. We asked for top floor, but at...

The service was as good as would expect on the strip, if not better, and the beds are amazing! Breakfast was fantastic and the entire hotel felt clean. The only downside was slow internet speeds.</p><br></body></html>
