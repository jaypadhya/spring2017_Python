<html><head><h3>BEST WESTERN PLUS Las Vegas West Hotel Reviews Page 18</h3></head><body><br>Great time in Las Vegas<p>I stayed here while working at a seminar at off strip resort. Well located about 10-15 minutes from Strip. Breakfast was amazing each day. Eggs, sausage, bacon, waffles, yogurt and more. 24 hour Pool and Hot Tub were Awesome. I soaked in both each night after the event. This saved my feet and my back. Cost was good less than 100.00 per night. very good value. Staff was very nice and hotel was quiet at night.</p><br>Beware of pool area<p>Our stay at the best western was great until the morning of checkout. My husband was still sleeping so I decided to take the kids to the pool. Against the wall is a water dispenser. The kids were playing around throwing cups of cold water on each other in the pool. My 5 year-old went and got some water and unbeknownst to me it was scolding. My daughter started screaming and the front desk guy came to see if everything was ok. The blisters had yet to form and there's nothing he could do anyway so he left. By the time we got to her room she had blisters all over her back. I went and asked the front desk if they had any burn cream (they did) but the clerk suggested putting toothpaste all over it instead (I didn't). I went back later to fill out an incident report and to simply make the suggestion of taking the hot water out of the pool area where lots of kids play. The clerk responded with, "people like to have tea at the pool and your kids were supposed to be supervised." I said, "they were supervised. You came out and spoke to me so you know they were supervised. And it clearly states no food or beverage allowed in pool area." I asked for an incident report paper and he said they didn't have any. I asked to speak to the manager and what do you know...they do have incident report forms. I wasn't asking for a free stay. I wasn't asking for them to take responsibility. I simply wanted to make a suggestion. But when Jose tried making me feel like I was neglectful and when he was so adamant the hot water was safe I lost all respect for this hotel. I wish I could attach a photo of her back.</p><br>Chasing that elusive big win...<p>Came here with a group of friends on a 'quiet' stag do. Had the time of our lives and the hotel was a perfect place to come back to and crash. I don't think we declared that we were on a 'batchelor party' as the hotel was very quiet and had a mix of business and families staying there but the service was excellent, the food and drinks great and the whole stay was very enjoyable!</p><br>Off Strip Hotel<p>The office staff was very polite and helpful. The breakfast was very good and well stocked. The hotel is off the strip but with a rental car it was located in an area that made it easy to access any part of the city,</p><br>Relaxing<p>Relaxing, good staff, pool was great. Convenient to all Las Vegas attractions. No smoking anywhere inside was a plus. Parking was a pleasure. Grounds were clean. Walking distance to food and stores. Will be my first choice in the future for trips to Las Vegas.</p><br>ProfessionalStaff, Clean Pet Friendly and Great Value<p>Perfect for a traveling family with a pet. No hidden pet fees or rules ie pet must be crated. Property was well maintained and very clean inside and out. Breakfast was good and the pool was heated just right! We highly recommend this property.</p><br>Best Western Plus Las Vegas<p>Great hotel for a reasonable price. The room was very clean, all of the amenities worked and the staff was friendly and accommodating. The area surrounding the hotel is populated with several nice shops and there is a casino nearby.</p><br>Good Hotel for a stopover<p>We stayed at this hotel overnight for our trip to and from San Diego. The room we had was very good. It was quiet and we got a good night's sleep. The free breakfast was ok. The hotel was within walking distance of an Out Back restaurant where we had dinner. Note: this hotel is not located on the Strip.</p><br>Best Western Summerlin<p>I was in the area to visit my son and had no interest or desire to be near the casinos. This motel was perfect for me. I had no issues with traffic or noise and was able to get around all of LV quite easily. I was afraid when I realized a young soccer team was also staying there but heard no noise from them. It was a very basic motel which was exactly what I needed.
Room Tip: I was in the "basement" and found it to be very quiet

The hotel is located a good 15 minutes drive to the Strip. It is a good choice if you have a pet with you. However, in my opinion, if you don't have a pet, it is better to stay somewhere closer to the center.
Our room was clean, and the bed was very comfortable. The wi-fi was free and worked very well. Breakfast was good and included coffee, waffles, biscuits with gravy, eggs and bacon, some fruit, and juices.
Employees at the reception desk were friendly and polite with us.
There is plenty of space to walk your dog around this place.
If i return to Vegas and my dog will be traveling with me, i would definitely stay at this hotel again. However if i am coming without the dog, i would stay somewhere on the Strip.</p><br></body></html>
