The handicap room had all the bars in the bathroom and a seat in the tub with a low enough shower. The mattresses were very comfortable. The WiiFi was free. They had a good free breakfast. We had a Microwave and a fridge. They had no smoking rooms. They had Handicap parking. They had an indoor pool and hot tub.</p><br>summerland - las vegas<p>the staff is always helpful and friendly, its conveniently located for me for business purpose. it keeps me a way from the traffic of the strip. rooms always clean, breakfast is always filling. I stay here every month for a few days and i keep coming back, that says a lot</p><br>Great Stay, Great Price<p>Everytime I visit Vegas, I stay at this place. Breakfast is included, it's not far from the strip, I like that it's not in the center of the commotion. Carlos the guy at the front desk, is always friendly and the price doesn't break the bank so I have $$ for the fun things.</p><br>Nice Quiet Stay, Close to Strip and Attractions<p>Stayed here 3 nights with family. This hotel is very clean, beds were comfortable, refrigerator and microwave in room, free wifi in room, and most important the staff was very professional and friendly. We arrived about 4 hours early (before check in time) and Jose was at the front desk and we asked him if we could check in early, he was very pleasant, and contacted the cleaning staff to get our room set up. Sahara Ave is not too far from The Strip, about 45 minutes from Hoover Dam, approximately 2 1/2 hours from Grand Canyon WEST RIM, Arizona (where the Skywalk is), and about 2 hours from Death Valley, Califorinia. We were able to drive to all of these places from our hotel during our stay. They have a nice area for breakfast, eggs, sausage or bacon, potatoes, french toast, fruit, breads, and a Machine to make your own pancakes. Also, there is an indoor heated pool, and a hot tub. Very clean area. Hot tub had many more jets than most hot tubs. Close to everything, shopping, restaurants, gas, etc. We stayed on 3rd floor, and is was very quiet. Our overall experience was very good at this hotel.
Room Tip: Third floor room was very quiet.

We parked right in front of the doors so he could keep an eye on it and he was so helpful and courteous, making us feel right at home. Best hotel experience I have ever had, exceptional staff. Breakfast the next morning was lovely, the room was clean, a perfect stay. I would highly recommend this place to anyone travelling through Vegas.</p><br>Exceptional hotel, staff and pet friendly <p>We spent a night while we were traveling with our small dog. We really like Best Western and this hotel was the nicest one we stayed at and the breakfast was the best we had. If you want to stay off the strip, and save money, this is the perfect place for you and the staff was super.</p><br>The best place to stay in Vegas!!<p>This hotel was 7mins from the strip but it was worth it. it was quite and clean. They had the best staff there. We wanted to order Chinese food but didnt know any place that would deliver but Carlos H. at the front desk was soooooo nice he helped us get the place and he even went to go get it when he was going to get his own dinner. He was the best.
Room Tip: if you have a small dog and 3 kids this is the place for you in Vegas.

We had an extremely clean room, with a comfortable bed, nice decor, and good seating. Everything looked newly refurbished. Our room was a little on the small side, but we were only there for one night. Standard breakfast offerings in a pleasant dining room. Nice staff. (I do wonder why they put a comforter on the bed, though. It was 99 degrees outside, and we had a little trouble keeping the room cool enough to sleep comfortably--comforter not necessary! I wish hotels would use a good old blanket instead, but they all seem to,have comforters these days.)</p><br>Clean quiet and comfortable,relatively close to Red Rock Canyon<p>My wife and I stayed here on 5/19. The hotel looked newly refurbished, it was within walking distance of 5 restaurants and it was easy to find. The room was reasonably big, clean and nicely decorated. The breakfast was one of the better ones I've had at a Best Western
We picked this hotel as we were going Red Rock Canyon the next morning and this hotel was one of the closer ones to the canyon.
We enjoyed our stay and would stay there again.</p><br>definitely again<p>If you are travelling to Las Vegas NOT for the casinos and don't want to mess with the casinos or downtown, this hotel is perfect. We were very comfortable in this location and shopping was very close.</p><br></body></html>
