Good places to eat close by and a golf course very close. I was headed to Death Valley so this was good for me. Pool area was nice. The room was nice clean and quiet.</p><br>Great Free Breakfast Included in your stay!<p>My wife, baby and I just stayed here for one night. The hotel was clean and completely smoke free and casino free. It was great to get some shut-eye and the breakfast was outstanding! Included were: waffles, bacon, sausage, eggs, cereal, muffins, juices, milk... just great for the whole family. I would definitely recommend this hotel for people wanting rest and an escape from the casinos and noise of the strip. The good thing is it is only a few miles away from all the gaming, so you're not too far away.

Plus... FREE WIFI</p><br>A staff that works with your needs<p>Before staying at this location I read many reviews many of which were not very good but I did notice that the manager was very attentive towards most of the reviews which gave me some comfort in knowing that they would do what the can to make the stay enjoyable for their guest. Long story short...that is just what they did. Thanks you guys! Carlos! Mike! & Erica!</p><br>Friendly staff<p>Overall the location was convenient, the appearance of the hotel and common areas were well kept and nicely decorated. The rooms were quiet, which is nice as some hotel walls seem paper thin. The rooms were of a decent size and the decor seemed updated, however the cleanliness could use some work. Overall the room was well kept and clean, however the bathroom tub hardly drained our feet turned a tint of black when walking barefoot. I am unsure if this was due to the tile flooring or maybe the carpets needed a good shampoo. The continental breakfast offered a decent selection for all pallets. Overall the stay was pleasant.</p><br>Out of the Way in Vegas<p>This hotel is quite a distance from the strip - which is what we were looking for, since this was an overnight on our way to Zion in Utah. Everything about this Best Western is adequate. It is tucked into a shopping center area and somewhat awkward to get to. The room was fine - included a kitchenette, which we had no use for. It was quiet and a good overnight alternative to more expensive hotels closer to the strip. Certainly clean and comfortable, if not spectacular.</p><br>Clean, Quiet and Nice<p>This is a very nice Pet Friendly hotel in Las Vegas, that doesn't charge an arm and a leg for your dog. The hot breakfast is nice, and the rooms were VERY nice. It is 7 miles from the strip, but there are lots of business's and restaurants on Sahara.</p><br>Quiet and Comfortable<p>The property is in a quiet and safe location in a great west Las Vegas location. The rooms are spacious and well appointed and the pool/spa area is great. Good breakfast and friendly staff. Excellent accommodations for the price.</p><br>Vegas stay<p>Nice new big rooms, with kitchen, large screen TV with all the channels Very clean and all the amenities. Everything was easy and convenient. Would stay here again. Check it out you will not be sorry.</p><br>Just what you would expect<p>This suburban property is just what you would expect in any city. I was here during an extended business trip in a remote area, and it's a nice location with lots of surrounding businesses that are lacking in the small town where I work most of the time. Plus, it's nice and quiet, and if I'm looking for Las Vegas tourist stuff, I can drive to the Strip.</p><br>Great hotel with great service<p>I stayed 3 nights at different Best Western Hotels for each night during my trip to Minesota and Illinois and got a free night voucher. Found this Best Western Plus hotel in Las Vegas with ~$110 per night on line for July 4th and able to use my free night voucher with this hotel. Great hotel with great service.</p><br></body></html>
