<html><head><h3>BEST WESTERN PLUS Las Vegas West Hotel Reviews Page 15</h3></head><body><br>A Great Hotel with Great Prices<p>We stayed at this Best Western by accident since our car broke down there and I can say the next time I'm in Vegas, I will stay here again. It is on the west side of Vegas off the strip, but within easy access to the strip. The hotel is fairly new and in great condition. Extremely clean and the staff was awesome. Vegas has gotten pretty expensive and this place has great prices. Check it out, it is pet and family friendly with a lot of good businesses nearby.</p><br>Amazing!<p>Beautiful place, Excellent location. The hotel is just simply amazing. They have a indoor pool which my family really loved. The prices are really good, they're not expensive and the associate are really wonderful and very respectful, and the girl at the front desk was very helpful and very respectful with all my questions and concerns. Overall a 5 star hotel and I recommend it to anyone.</p><br>Very good hotel!<p>Very good hotel...15 minuts from the Strip, so it's perfect if you want to "visit" the city without "living it"...comfortable and elegant rooms, average breakfast (it could be better), great attention of the employees and great indoor pool, which it's a great value. Some negative points: the outside aircon is a bit noisy.</p><br>Quiet location - great rooms<p>Looking for a hotel in Summerlin Las Vegas area, stayed here because of the ratings and reviews on-line. Did not disappoint. Friendly and helpful staff, clean and well appointed room and hotel overall. Easy access to major streets and nearby dining. Very quite location.</p><br>Wonderful Stay<p>Best Western Plus always meets my expectations. Reasonable rates, clean room and great service staff. The cinammon rolls were the highlight of the stay. We travel w/ a large dog and the facilities for the pet friendly room were convenient. Have stayed here before and look forward to staying here again.</p><br>Unprofessional Customer Service Staff - Jose &amp; Erika<p>Don't bother staying here unless you are sure there won't be any problems. The front desk clerk Jose and the Mgr Erica are HORRIBLE with customers, if there is anything they have to resolve. The hotel itself is nice however, but the way I was treated by the staff i would NEVER go back there. The mgr refused to talk with me when I was in the lobby and when I called later - she was conveniently "out". I had some personal family problems that led to my cancellation and rebooking the hotel twice. I apologized for any trouble for the clerk Jose. Meanwhile, he had messed up using the gift card I had and he didn't know how to fix it - so he asked me to come in next day to see his manager to get it straightened out. Which I did, but the manager didn't come out to see me and Jose started acting rude and stand off to me. I later rebooked the hotel and he called me at home and told me they would NOT HONOR my rewards voucher (for staying 2 nights earlier this year) and they would NOT HONOR my gift card. They would only take my credit card. I couldn't believe this. The mistake with the card was originally his fault and I didn't get upset with him!! I had actually apologized for his mistake and was trying to be nice about it!! Anyway, I couldn't believe his phone call to my home, so I asked to speak with his manager or the owner - he came back and said she had "stepped" out. I called again in 20 minutes and he said she had gone home early for the day. I am completely disillusioned with Best Western West Las Vegas. I have spoken with Corp Customer Care and hope to get a call back from Mr. Clark the owner. Just so he knows what is going on at this hotel. I didn't know a Best Western would refuse their own rewards program and gift card purchased. I hope others will read this and be sure they are aware of this staff who is so unreasonable when something abnormal should happen. I sincerely don't think I deserved this treatment - it is like they have never had a customer book, cancel and rebook before. I don't think they were full or anything like that - the parking lot was empty. I don't understand their behaviors.</p><br>great !<p>I really loved my experience at the hotel very we'll cleaned , room was in perfect conditions breakfast was great !
front desk employee jose was very helpful and amazing .
I look forward into coming again in the nearest future .</p><br>Non Existent Breakfast<p>Hotel is a decent enough property, and the only BW that I would stay at in las Vegas. That said, the location is so far away from anywhere, that is an issue. Plus, make sure you get there early for breakfast, as regardless of the time that you told that breakfast is served, it is not true. We went and everything was shut down early and the staff member informed us that they stop making things quite early as if they don't, then people will just keep coming and coming until 11 am. The staff member also mentioned that the Hotel does not pay them past a certain time, so if they don't shut things down early, then they get stuck there working for free! No wonder they stop things so early, I would be as well. Unfortunately there were many others in my situation, well before the time the breakfast room was to close down, standing around, seeing that everything was shut already, so nothing to eat, not even bread. Very disappointing for a BW, even worse for a BW Plus!</p><br>Great value in Vegas!<p>A lovely hotel with a pleasant staff, not far from Red Rock Canyon and the Red Rock Casino and restaurant area. Rooms are a little small and the free hot breakfast a bit plain, but all that we needed. Indoor swimming pool and hut tub and small fitness center were pleasant and clean.</p><br>GREAT STAY, FANTASTIC SERVICE<p>After traveling in the car for 8 hours. Me and my family were really tired. Right when I walked in I was greeted right away. We got our room right away. We were in Vegas for like 5 days. We have a fantastic time. All in all it was a great stay!!</p><br></body></html>
