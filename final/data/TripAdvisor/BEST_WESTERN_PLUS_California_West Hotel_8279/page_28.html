<html><head><h3>BEST WESTERN PLUS Las Vegas West Hotel Reviews Page 28</h3></head><body><br>Very clean . Staff very helpful<p>Will stay here again. Breakfast was awsome. Staff was great. Location is perfect. Rooms very clean. Loved the indoor pool.
Liked it was not to far from they strip. But not to close. And it was very quite.</p><br>Nice place off the Strip<p>Our check in and check out left a lot to be desired: Young man couldn't find our reservations and then gave us a queen instead of the king we reserved. At check out we couldn't find anyone to give us a receipt and had to rush off to the airport. We got our room changed to the king by a very helpful front desk the next morning. Would recommend staying in a king suite room as it has lots of room and better set up than the queen room. The queen room was cramped and the heater/air machine was NOISY!! The ladies at the front counter were pleasant and helpful. The gentlemen working weren't. The breakfast was varied and fresh, lots to choose from. We would have appreciated an elevator, but it is only a two story hotel. There's an Outback in the same parking lot and a Burger King right next door. Room was clean, but the beds were hard. We would stay there again.
Room Tip: Get a king suite for more room.

After the first night I noticed that they had double billed me for my room. I went to the front desk and the lady at the counter said that she could not help me and that she would have to ask her manager. She then said that her manager would never answer her phone before 9:00 am so I would have to wait. Later that evening I went back to the counter and asked the man working about the bill (the same man who checked us in) he said that we were not double billed but that they had changed their policy the day we checked in and that they hold $165 until we check out just in case "we trash our room" I asked why he did not tell me he was going to do that and he told me that I should have read the fine print through Expedia because they can do whatever they want. I've stayed at many hotels in my life time (much nicer than the Best Western at that) and have NEVER had my card charged like that! I've also never been treated with such disrespect at a hotel. When I told him that I would never stay at their hotel again and that I would be writing a review he just smerked and said ok. What a joke!</p><br>conference<p>Overall this was a nice hotel. I really liked the price. The bed was a little too firm but the room was clean, although small. The breakfast was good and the staff was very helpful. The main complaint was no elevator. This was not a problem for me as I only had a carry on but if I had been there with family with more luggage it would have been a problem. The exercise room is also very small.</p><br>Will be back<p>Great 2 night stay . Very clean room . Check in is quick and easy. The pool is open 24 hrs a day. The hotel is about 10 mins away from the strip. Excellent hot breakfast. We stayed in a double queen room. We asked for more towels and they
were there with in 10 mins. All the staff were very help full.</p><br>Cute hotel in Vegas style<p>As the Best Western level always is, this hotel doesn't dissapoint. Staff was very friendly, location was great, and the prices were not sky-high as in the other hotels. I would very much recommend it for a trip with limited budget.</p><br>Keep up the good work!<p>My bulldog and I recently had the pleasure of staying at this hotel for about a week towards the end of August. Erica and her entire staff were very friendly and knowledgeable of the area. They took a liking to my bulldog and would come from behind the desk to pet him which he definitely enjoyed. They even washed my blender and shaker so I could continue drinking my protein smoothies while displaced from our apartment due to a mold issue. The room we stayed in was clean and spacious. It even included a jacuzzi big enough for two (no I did not let the dog bathe with me lol). If we're ever in Las Vegas again, this would be our first choice for a place to stay. Thanks again everyone for a pleasant stay!</p><br>A nice stay away from the strip<p>This was a great place to stay after a hectic night spent in a hotel on the strip. Very clean, comfortable and has a good continental breakfast. Desk agent/mgr Erica, was very helpful and spent time giving us ideas on places to visit and to eat in the area. We loved her recommendation of the Mad Greek restaurant next door. AMAZING greek food and service...but that's another review. :) Oh, almost forgot...the pool, even though it was indoors, was perfect for us.</p><br>Excellent Hotel<p>Very clean room. Quiet,friendly staff, great breakfast. Was in town for a wedding and the location perfect. Within minutes of any of the Las Vegas attractions.I would recommend to my friends and definitely stay there again.</p><br>A good stop in Las Vegas<p>I really have no complaints about my stay at this Best Western Plus except that I don't like basement rooms. I was happy with the price. The room was excellent, clean, comfortable, nice desk, good bathroom and shower, wifi that worked well. I should have requested a room on the second floor when I discovered I had been located in the basement. The breakfast was reasonable and there was a Subway nearby for snacks. No restaurant nearby as far as I could determine, but no gambling machines which was a plus with me. My stop in Las Vegas was necessitated because I needed to have my new motorcycle serviced or else I would have pushed on to Pahrump.</p><br></body></html>
