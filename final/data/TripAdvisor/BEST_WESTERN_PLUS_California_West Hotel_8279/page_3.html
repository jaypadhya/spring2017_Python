<html><head><h3>BEST WESTERN PLUS Las Vegas West Hotel Reviews Page 3</h3></head><body><br>Excellent Stay<p>I had an enjoyable time. All staff was very helpful, Breakfast was fantastic I had lots to choose from. The room was very clean & the bed was extremely comfortable. There are several eateries in the area. I would definetly stay here again.</p><br>Stay Away<p>Manager in this hotel has no clue how to treat customers, I'm wondering how did someone like that became a manager?
Rude ,Disrespectful ...!!!
You would expect a manager to know what a prepaid voucher is, this one had no clue, and because of that he thought we stayed at the hotel 3 nights for free.
I would not recommend this hotel to none.

There a much better choices in Las Vegas ... where you get the respect & Service for your money.</p><br>Still Outstanding<p>We always try to stay here when we stop in Vegas because it is perfect for us--very nice, reasonable hotel way off the Strip. We don't even mind that it is so far from I-15. A plus for us is that a nice Outback Restaurant is right next to the hotel. It upholds well the Best Western brand.</p><br>Nice rooms but Noisest aircon ever<p>I stayed in this hotel for 2wks whilst looking for a permanent residence. The rooms are big, spacious and well maintained, however, the aircon unit was so loud I couldn't hear the TV for it.
The staff were friendly and helpful on the most part. Especially the housekeeping staff. The breakfasts are pretty basic with throw away plates and cutlery! Free WiFi is what redeems this hotel.
All in all, an average hotel away from the hustle and bustle of Las Vegas.</p><br>A hidden gem<p>Booked this hotel for a great deal, we stayed on the strip the last time we were in Vegas, but this time we were looking for something quiet and away from the strip, we had plans to be on tours outside of Vegas almost every day, so we wanted a simple hotel to sleep, shower and take a swim in a pool every now and again, we enjoyed the hot tub, the kids liked the pool. It was bang on what we were looking for, quiet, clean, well maintained property, not too smokey, had a decent pool, great complimentary breakfast, helpful staff. Definitively a good value, it took a load off the trip budget.</p><br>Quiet oasis in Vegas<p>Hotel is well maintained. Rooms are lovely, king rooms have a comfortable chair with ottoman. Rooms smell good, are clean, quiet and the bed is very comfortable. There are several dining options within walking distance which is always a plus. I didn't use the pool area this trip so can't comment on it here. I was able to avoid downtown coming in from Phoenix and there is easy access to 95 North so that I could continue my journey.</p><br>Best Best Western In Las Vegas<p>I have stayed in two other best western hotels in Las Vegas and so far this is my favorite of the bunch. Its right off Sahara and its clean, quiet, and comfortable. The staff is personal, and friendly. The rooms are quiet and parking is easy. They took care of me and made me feel welcome and at ease. Its away from the crowds, noise, and airport runway.</p><br>The Quiet Side of Vegas<p>We were coming off a two-week trip and just wanted a nice, quiet place to relax and we got it at this Best Western. It was extremely clean, nice and comfortable. The room was really nice, the value was great. We were across town from the strip, which is what we wanted. They are pet-friendly and offer the free breakfast which was above average with lots of choices. Overall, an excellent experience.</p><br>Clean, friendly place to stay<p>Not usually a Best Western fan as locations vary greatly in quality from city to city, but this one is definitely one to put on your list if you are in Vegas visiting friends. Staff is excellent, breakfast was surprisingly good, and business center is a plus.</p><br>Great Location and a very pleasant stay<p>We were really pleased that this hotel looked new, had nice and comfortable furnishings. A really nice breakfast and super nice employees. Close to an Outback Steak House, we could walk, and liked the general surrounding of this property. We will stay here again on our next trip to or thru Las Vegas.</p><br></body></html>
