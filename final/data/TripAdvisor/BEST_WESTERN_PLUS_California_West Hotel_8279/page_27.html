<html><head><h3>BEST WESTERN PLUS Las Vegas West Hotel Reviews Page 27</h3></head><body><br>Quite, Convenient and Value<p>Found this gem of a Best Western Plus off the beaten path of hustle-bustle Las Vegas and enjoyed it immensely! Great vale for the price, very clean rooms, friendly staff, and a wonderful hot breakfast in the morning. Also, it is close to one of Las Vegas' wide, main thoroughfares, yet in a quiet setting. Outback Steakhouse and Burger King within walking distance. Very helpful and friendly staff!</p><br>Best service<p>I highly recommend this hotel. They are clean, professional and always provide excellent service. We stayed for a week and didn't want to leave! For the price and quality, this is the best place to stay off the strip.</p><br>Great location...<p>away from the strip for quiet! We had a bit of a problem finding the place since we came into Vegas area at night. However, the front desk guy that night in August, talked me through it on the phone. Once we arrived, our room, which we booked on the first level, was lovely. Easy parking access and quiet room.
The hot breakfast was wonderful and the hot cinnamon rolls are addictive!!
We like the suburban location as we visited the strip mostly at night do to the heat during the day. The weather was better by the hotel, too!! No rain as on the strip! I go back there again. The price was great, too.
Room Tip: Ask for a room near the back door so you don't have to walk through the lobby.

From the minute we checked in, Jose was very professional and helpful. He greeted us with a smile on his face. He was very friendly, so right off the bat I knew we were off to a good start. The rooms were also very clean and comfortable. The housekeepers do an excellent job maintaining the rooms clean. Not only that, but there were various stores and restaurants at a walking distance. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone who is trying to stay away from the strip and is looking for a pleasurable experience. I assure you, you will not regret it!</p><br>horible<p>My room was in the basement!! The beds are hard as a rock and the pillows the size of a dolls pillow. There was mold on the wall and ceiling in the bathroom. Never again!! The exercise room is a joke. But hey there are cookies on the counter for you when you arrive.</p><br>I Recommend Best Western Plus<p>First off when i checked in, the front desk agent, Carlos, was very helpful. Early in the morning i got up and went straight to the breakfast and it was terrific. The food smelled amazing and tasted delicious! Everything was good ! The bacon, the eggs, and the cinnamon rolls were my favorite. But mostly there was a breakfast hostess. She was a young woman that was very kind and helpful. Also the rooms were great! They were clean, the beds were comfy,and the room service was just great.. The pool is always open and it is indoors which was great! The pool wasnt too cold & there was a jacuzzi which was very relaxing! But i think the best part of this hotel is that when i checked in there were fresh cookies that i had to try!</p><br>Best Western<p>Great quality, great location and very nice hotel. It is clean and good looking. The staff is very helpful and friendly. I very much enjoyed my two nights here. Room service here is the best, and way better than other hotels in my opinion. For the two nights that I spent at this hotel, I felt great. I slept pretty good, considering that there is no noise level to complain about. Aside from that, everything else is really close. Small stores and restaurant are only a few minutes away.</p><br>BEST HOTEL IVE EVER STAYED AT!<p>Me and my gf decided to stay at this hotel for a few days and it was the best decision we could of made for our trip. Hotel was clean, front desk was very polite and professional. The pool and spa is open 24 hours and we loved it! We would deffinitely come back and stay at this hotel again.</p><br>A beautiful experience<p>I came to the Best Western with my mom from Colorado to stay for a week while I had surgery. The manager was so sweet and accommodating and offered a great rate to stay for the week. We had a king suite with kitchen and were so happy to be able to cook at home while I recovered. The front desk staff was always very kind and the cleaning staff were very very sweet!! The breakfast buffet was tasty and highly recommend. Thank you for a great experience!</p><br>Best Western<p>The hotel is fine and the pool is great. My main concern is that the key card readers do not read the keys very well. In a three night stay, I had to have the keys recoded 5 times. It was very frustrating.</p><br></body></html>
