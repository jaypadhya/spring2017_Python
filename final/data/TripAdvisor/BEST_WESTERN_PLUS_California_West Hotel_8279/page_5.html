<html><head><h3>BEST WESTERN PLUS Las Vegas West Hotel Reviews Page 5</h3></head><body><br>Business Comfort<p>If you are in Vegas for business and want a room away from all the noise of the strip and casinos, this is it! Easy to get in and out of. All the amenities you need. Affordable price. Friendly staff. Well worth the money. Up to 20 mins away from any given point in Vegas.</p><br>Great location<p>I use this hotel quite often for business. It's far enough from the strip to have a quiet nights stay but close enough to the freeways and there are many options for food and entertainment near by. The staff is always great.</p><br>Fabulous Pool and Hot Tub<p>Driving across country and stopped . Pet friendly and super clean. All employees were extremely nice and gave us the best treatment - from check-in to breakfast (Yanut) . Thank you for your hospitality and friendly care. Definitely stay here. Just a wonderful experience all around !</p><br>3rd year in a row!<p>Stayed here three years in a row for EDC and I absolutely love it! The property itself is super clean (and smoke free!) - from the lobby - to the elevators - to the rooms. The breakfast in the morning is a great addition. The beds are comfortable and the TV's are huge with a great selection of channels. The location is perfect where it is tucked away off the freeway but it is close enough to fast food, etc if needed. The only thing that kind of annoyed me this year was the housekeepers. Three of them showed up at our door on checkout day after I told them we had a confirmed late checkout from the front desk. One of them said "no I don't think so, you better check because you will get charged". I had to politely let them know that it was in fact confirmed without charge. The housekeepers have never bothered me on years previous so it was just annoying that they could ruin the experience after the rest of the staff is so amazing. For as long as I attend EDC this hotel will always be my choice!</p><br>50th Anniversary Tour To See America<p>We started our tour with a stop in Fla to visit Family with stays at Best Western at Houston, San Antonio, El Paso,Oceanside, Calif, Las Vegas. Each and everyone has been a very good experience for us. We will visit the Grand Canyon the 25th and then north to Yellowstone and look forward to many more stays at Best Western.</p><br>Weekend Getaway<p>Stayed for EDC weekend. Had a fantastic stay here. Unfortunately AC had issues but thanks to Carlos helped out & got fixed it ASAP. The rooms were nice and clean plus breakfast was good. Stay here if you're looking for good customer service & good rates.</p><br>Average Hotel<p>Nothing special about this hotel. Perhaps an update in furniture and decor is needed. Hotel staff seemed non-existent and I was looking for a bell to ring while checking in. Room was okay but was fully cleaned. Forgot to take out trash and clean bathroom.</p><br>Blah, Average hotel; Yuk on the breakfast!; Poor bad internet on 3rd floor; Rude morning staff &amp; absent management; Meh<p>Decent, bathroom a little cramped, must fight with the door to get into the shower. Last guests hair is on the shower wall unless that is the maids hair. Isn't mine as I am bald.
Breakfast sucks. Is fake eggs and other barely edible swill. Room is decent and AC works good. Bathroom sink does NOT drain properly so can’t use full water force. Nice TV channel variety. Location is good, away from the strip and peaceful and quiet. Internet stinks! Night guy had to climb/reach into the ceiling panels on 3rd floor to reset access points b4 I could access internet. Asked for late check-out and got a "no". Asked front desk girl to ask manager and she said "I will ask her and call you back". Never got a call back. How rude! Promise to call guest and never do. Staff & manager does not care about guest, so I will simply stay elsewhere next time. Outback is right in front of hotel – too bad they cant cook a steak.</p><br>Love Best Western Plus<p>We always enjoy Best Western Plus. Loved the pool, the breakfast, nice rooms, helpful staff. Our family really likes the value--it's enough comfort without feeling like you're paying for unnecessary extravagance.</p><br>Indoor 24hr Pool<p>Big Family event in the area and this was a great place to come home to for rest, recoup, and regroup from the Strip, Downtown, and Family get together.....all the expectations of a regular Best Western guest</p><br></body></html>
