<html><head><h3>BEST WESTERN PLUS Las Vegas West Hotel Reviews Page 19</h3></head><body><br>Excellent hotel on the edge of Vegas<p>My 2 kids (ages 11 and 15) and I stayed here for two nights in April 2014. It was so much more than I expected of a Best Western. The rooms were clean, the front desk staff was helpful, and the location was good (I didn't want to stay in the heart of Vegas, and this was a short 5-10 minutes drive to the Strip). Parking was plentiful, there is a (small) fitness room with 3 or 4 machines, which was never crowded. The (free) breakfast was good - included a waffle maker, breads, juices, cereals, cinnamon rolls, and a few other items. All were fresh. There was a pool too (which we didn't use). I was very impressed overall and would definitely recommend. As a bonus, the hotel is only about 10 minutes drive from Red Rock National Conservation Area, a must-see if you are in this area, and a lovely change of scenery after all the neon lights and crowds of the Strip.</p><br>my place to stay in Vegas<p>When visiting family this where we stay this is your second time at this hotel and once again all is right here. No problems, great breakfast, nice pool, nice room, and great staff
What more could I ask for ?
Room Tip: Make reservations in advance

After 1 hour - he still could not fix the problem, he became even more mad and rude to me and my mother. He never politely spoke or explained situation professionally. What he did just make a small fixing because a severe insult to the customers. The whole hotel during the busy Saturday night only had one other staff than Mike, Luli, who is Mike daughter, as the front desk person. Staying here totally ruined my night in Vegas. Too few staff, bad management, noisy old AC & lack of customer courtesy training - AOVID this hotel if possible.</p><br>One night on road trip to San Dieo<p>Stay at this BW on a family road trip from Salt Lake to San Diego. Traffic was bad in Vegas at 3 pm so it was nice to stay somewhere off the strip. Very nice comfortable beds, excellent breakfast buffet.</p><br>BW Las Vegas West Very Good<p>Very comfortable and quiet room. Room layout was very generous. Plenty of hot water. Internet service was pretty slow (<3MB/S) for streaming videos but okay for email. We skipped the free breakfast because the room was jammed with people.</p><br>Not the best but will do.<p>We stayed here for 2 nights. I chose the location as there are NO bedbugs(vegas is riddled with them)!
The hotel was clean and away from the strip. Which is what I wanted! Upon arrival the check in lady was not the friendliest! Did not want to accept my Canadian Credit card as a deposit-even though it is a Mastercard (that is what I booked my hotel with on line!) I offered to pay cash and she would not accept that either!
Finally she accepted the mastercard. She was not friendly at all! The rooms were nice( I had booked online and phoned to confirm that the rooms were adjoining and they were not!They were beside another (but not what was promised!). The keys repeatedly did not work. Breakfeast was complimentary and the parking was free.

not the best value for a pricy hotel.
Room Tip: A/C noisy.
See more room tips</p><br>quiet place<p>For Las Vegas, a very good value. About 10-15 minutes from strip, so well removed from the hassle, traffic and noise of the strip. No rip off "resort fees." Beds were on the soft side but pretty comfortable. We did not use the Wi-Fi but it was available. Breakfast okay as free food goes. Staff was helpful at check in.</p><br>Very comfortable hotel<p>This is a very comfortable hotel. The room was spacious, there is a refrigerator and the beds were comfortable. The breakfast buffet was great. It wasn't just cereal and bread, there were eggs and potatoes. The staff is friendly. The hotel is away from the strip and is in a quiet area. I would definitely stay here again.</p><br>Nice getaway from heat and bustle<p>It was a good quality and value Best Western Plus standard product. Very good breakfast and reliable wifi. Convenient location to NW Las Vegas and all soccer venues granddaughter played at, and seemed far from the "strip".</p><br>Cozy spot<p>Great motel. Delicious breakfast. Seemed a little pricey, but beds were super comfortable, and hotel very quiet. Good location. Near Death Canyon. Easy to get in and out. Would stay here again, but would not pay more than $110.00 per night.</p><br></body></html>
