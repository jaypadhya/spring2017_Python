Everything in room worked as promised,Good water pressure,drains that do not back up in tub</p><br>Above and Beyond<p>We stayed at this hotel twice, on our arrival to Las Vegas beginning a two week tour of Utah and when we flew back home. The staff went above and beyond to accommodate us. We had a problem with shipping out our luggage. The manager kept in touch with me via email and made sure that UPS picked up our luggage and delivered it safely to our home. The rooms were clean and well decorated. The internet service was fast. It was far enough away from the "Strip" so we were not bothered with the traffic and noise!</p><br>Good for business travel<p>I only stayed here one night and overall it was a good experience. I didn't give myself enough time for breakfast at the hotel, but it looked good and I did get to grab coffee, which I love being able to do. The only negative is that the walls are thin and noises seep through easily - definitely a place where I recommend having your earplugs.</p><br>Would stay here again<p>Customer Service
This was a nice hotel in a nice area. It was about 12 minutes from the strip. The area, Summerland, felt safe.The customer services was good. They were very accommodating with my request to move rooms. The original room was too close to the breakfast room and we had anticipated a lot of noise early in the morning. The hotel clerk let us pick which room we wanted.

Complimentary Breakfast
I have stayed a several Best Westerns, and this one had the most impressive breakfast of them all. It had eggs, bacon, scrabbled eggs,fresh made warm cinnamon rolls, biscuits and gravy, oatmeal, cereal, juice, yogurt, apples, bananas, oranges, bagels, toast, waffle maker. We saved a lot of money on food having breakfast everyday at the hotel.

The room
The room had all the essentials, fridge, microwave, desk, free wifi was great, nice furniture, it had comfortable beds. My only issue was the carpets were very dirty. They were a dark brown which disguised the dirt. My socks were filthy after just 5 minutes. I usually wear sandals in all hotels but I forgot them for this trip.

This was a great hotel and I would stay here again.
Room Tip: Rooms away from the breakfast room are quieter.

He actually listens to people who work for him; like Mirela a 10-year veteran breakfast buffet room manager. Mirela, a charming woman /w a strong work ethic, makes your problem her problem. She Is so good I would hire her if I owned a biz. People are "MY GUESTS, said Mirela." She is the reason I return (6 Xs). I am an insomiac so when I woke up 10 minutes to close Mirela fed me, smiling. The Front Desk Carlos recognizes us! Kudos 2 mgmt 4 valuing those who earn profits</p><br>Best Value for the Money<p>If you are looking for a safe and inviting place to stay while in Las Vegas, this is the hotel. It's like a home away from home! My husband and I love staying here whenever we visit Summerlin and Las Vegas.</p><br>Great Stay.. great customer service..Awesome Staff<p>I stayed at this hotel recently and had an extremely pleasant stay, even before finding out I left a bunch of my clothes there. The staff retrieved my clothes unscathed and returned them promptly. The continental breakfast was delicious and every front member staff, especially Jose was amazing.. please send my regards to the wonderful housekeeping staff. Best place to stay outside of the strip if you're looking for peace, quite and a relaxed atmosphere.
Room Tip: I like the ground floor, which is one below the lobby. Access right to parking.

The staff were all pleasant and helpful. We especially appreciated that it was a non-smoking facility. And did we mention it was quiet!?
Room Tip: Our room was at the far end so you could park at the back. It was convenient to come and go.

Had one issue where when upon check-in I requested a late check-out time and the person who checked me in did not make note of it in the late check-out log book. This created a disturbance by housekeeping when I still had an hour left. When I called the front desk they were very apologetic and made sure I wasn't interrupted again. When I checked out the front desk advised me of the lack of notation for my room and the late check out. He was very very friendly where as the person who checked me in was very aloof. Over all, great hotel to stay in.</p><br>Mixed review<p>Stayed twice when flying in and out of Las Vegas. The first night was great, the room was very comfortable and the breakfast very good for hotel breakfast. The second night we were in room 222 and the mattress on that bed was awful. Did not sleep well at all as the mattress creaked every time either of us moved and I felt like we were compressing the mattress to the box spring. (we are NOT too heavy for the bed). Went to breakfast and there was no hot food ready, almost 20 minutes to get egg and bacon, never did get potatoes. Hotel is away from the strip as we wanted it to be, and the trip to the airport was easy driving. Did not see an airport shuttle.
Room Tip: The rooms that we had were both on the main floor. I did not see anything other than one corridor.
