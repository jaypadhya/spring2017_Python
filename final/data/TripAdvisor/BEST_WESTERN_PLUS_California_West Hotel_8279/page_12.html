<html><head><h3>BEST WESTERN PLUS Las Vegas West Hotel Reviews Page 12</h3></head><body><br>Great stay<p>I really enjoyed my stay here. I stay here for business. They always make sure everything is ready and clean for meme. Erica and Luli always go above and beyond to make sure my stay is the most comfortable it can be. Restaurants are close by and it's in a safe location.</p><br>Comfortable stay<p>Nice hotel with several restaurants next door (Outback and great Moroccan food). Room is nice but a bit small. It was quite, comfortable and I slept great. Wifi was great.

Breakfast was OK, it would be nice if they had traditional oatmeal. Small exercise room with bike, treadmill and weight machine. It would be nice if they had a elliptical machine.

All and all a good place to stay at reasonable price. I will stay again on next visit.</p><br>Nice Stay<p>The room are clean and the beds are really confortable. The staff was very helpful and friendly. The breakfast was great. The best part was that their was not any noise. I will definetley be staying again at this hotel.</p><br>Quiet and comfortable<p>Las Vegas is usually noisy and smoky in the hotels. We loved that this isn't. We laughed that we were the only ones that could find a great hotel in Vegas that is quiet and no gambling.
The beds were wonderful and the room spacious and very clean. Pet friendly, quiet and reasonable what more could we ask.</p><br>Solid service and value<p>This is a quiet hotel with consistently good service. Good breakfast selection, decent wifi, good beds and reasonable cost. It is located off the Strip, but is very close to a good selection of restaurants and shopping. We've stayed here on several occasions and have not been disappointed.</p><br>Thanksgiving <p>Family and I stayed here over Thanksgiving. The hotel is centrally located with easy access to freeways and shops. I have stayed at many bw hotels while traveling but this one was at the top. Very friendly staff that goes above and beyond for any of your needs. I have two younger children so being able to take them swimming in the indoor heated pool was a huge plus! Overall we were very satisfied with our stay. Thank you to all the staff at the BW Las Vegas! We will be back.</p><br>Hey<p>Hey, it was an amazing night at you're hotel last weekend, and i wanted to say that the place was very clean and the staff were amazing especially Carlos! next time i will come and stay at this same hotel again. thank you very much :)!</p><br>Great place to stay<p>We enjoyed our visit, it was a very quite hotel, great service, pool and spa was awesome. I would recommend this hotel to everyone . My wife uses a cane and the Breakfast lady looked out for her she was awesome. Rooms were clean ,comfortable bed. Breakfast had a lot of variety too. we were pleased with the Hotel as we usually are with most Best Westerns we stay in.</p><br>Simply the best.<p>There is nothing to complain about, everything is the best, over the past year iv Seen different places stayed in different hotels, and this one is by far the best hotel iv stayed at, the most friendliest people ever, it makes you feel like your right at home, the best customer service.</p><br>If you want a nice room away from the strip this is it<p>This motel is away from the strip and a little ways from the airport but very clean and nice. Clean rooms and comfy beds.The Continental breakfast was great they had scrambled eggs, sausage,bacon,biscuits and gravy and waffles pus all the other carbs most have. I did not have time to try the indoor pool but it looked nice. The staff was very nice when I checked in and out. I would definitely stay there again for my next business trip in that area.</p><br></body></html>
