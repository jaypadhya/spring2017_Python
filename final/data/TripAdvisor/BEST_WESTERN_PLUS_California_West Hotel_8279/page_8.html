<html><head><h3>BEST WESTERN PLUS Las Vegas West Hotel Reviews Page 8</h3></head><body><br>Deserves the "Plus" Rating!<p>A very nice hotel for my needs as I wasn't interested in the "glitz" of the strip hotels and this one certainly lives up to Best Western standards. I had a very nice room ("suite?") with modern furnishings, including a flat screen TV and a Keurig coffee maker and it was immaculately clean! The comfortable king bed had very nice large pillows and the bathroom was large and accessible. Breakfast was above average for a Best Western with hot foods available (the bacon was real but the eggs appeared, and tasted like they were powdered). My wake up call came five minutes late but, fortunately, I was already up and moving about when it did come in. Overall, I have a very favorable impression of this hotel but I do think it was a bit pricey as I've stayed in better hotels (e.g., the Tuscany) which are located closer to the action at about half the price. I would definitely consider staying here again, but, if I did, I would try to negotiate a better rate. Other than that, two "thumbs up!"</p><br>Great stay<p>Hotel is beautiful, clean, and good breakfast. Bed was very nice, looked like all new furniture. Lots of amenities around. Has a nice indoor pool and spa. Front desk, housekeeping and breakfast all had very friendly staff.</p><br>GREAT<p>Would recommend this hotel to anyone, we had a super quick check in, and the room was great, the beds out standing, and the noise factor none. Breakfast was amazing, if in Vegas would stay there again.</p><br>Comfort &amp; Amenities in a nice neighborhood<p>We enjoyed a nice, quiet & clean room with ample free parking in a lovely neighborhood. We even took the time to take our morning walks after eating a full breakfast provided with our room charges. A very pleasant experience</p><br>Nice place<p>Quiet, off the strip. Rooms are decent, clean and fairly quiet. I didn't hear much noise. This is my go to hotel when I'm on business in Vegas. The hotel breakfast is pretty decent, just wish they would serve gravy. Last time I was there they had bisquits and no gravy, was a disappointment.</p><br>Incredibly poor service<p>We chose this hotel because of its location - on the west side of Las Vegas, close to Red Rock Canyons Park. We made reservations about three months before we went, and prepaid to get a better rate. We arrived at 2:30 p.m., and I requested a quiet room, as far from the elevators and vending machines as possible. When we found our room, it was in a semi-basement (with the ground outside level with our window - easy for a thief to kick in), tiny, and directly across from not only the vending machines, but also the hotel staff's laundry room. We were exhausted, so after an early dinner I went to the front desk (with a different attendant) and asked to move to a more acceptable room. When he asked what room we were in I told him 102, and he started to say, "Oh no, we never....." and then he stopped. He then informed me that the hotel was sold out, and he couldn't move us. My best advice - DON'T GO THERE! My second best advice - don't accept a room that is on the 100 level, especially 102, 104, or 106, and NEVER prepay.
Room Tip: Never accept a room in the 100 level, never prepay.

Makes visit to Las Vegas easy and a pleasure. Close to strip without the frenzy.</p><br>excellent hotel<p>This was the best best western I have ever stayed at great customer service and a very clean facility. The breakfast was very good. Alot of stuff to choose from. Will never look for any where else to stay in vegas but here. The indoor pool and jaccuzi was also great.</p><br>Great Accommodations and Service<p>Jose, Eduardo, and Carlos provided wonderful service. Our room was clean with great housekeeping service. Cookies were always offered at the front desk. Also, the breakfasts were well prepared, fresh, and offered great variety.</p><br>Still a great place to stay<p>We have stayed here a number of times as we travel between Oregon and Arizona each year. The service is always nice, the rooms are very nice and the neighborhood is peaceful and quiet, unlike the downtown Las Vegas area. The only short coming is the breakfast area is a little small for the number of folks wishing to eat in the morning and gets pretty crowded with some folks having to stand and wait for room.</p><br></body></html>
