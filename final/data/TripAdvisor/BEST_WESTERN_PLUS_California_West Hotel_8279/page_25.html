<html><head><h3>BEST WESTERN PLUS Las Vegas West Hotel Reviews Page 25</h3></head><body><br>comfortable place<p>this place is ten minutes from the strip and tucked away off the main street, the staff including house keeping were very nice and pleasant people, I would recommend this place if you have children as down town Las Vegas strip is not very kid friendly except maybe the M&M factory.
rooms were very clean, the A/C kept it cool as temps outside averaged 104 deg. I didn't use the indoor pool, but it looked inviting, breakfast is 6:30-9:30 with plenty to eat, there are no elevators, if you need assistance in that area, call ahead I'm sure staff will help, one of my travelers had a walker and they were easy to place us on the main floor.</p><br>L V Stay<p>Price, quality, service, cleanliness were all very nice. Made the stay for business very easy. And it is located next door to an Outback Steakhouse, so dinner was easy and convenient too. This place is my first choice because I work just down the street, so thankfully, it meets all my needs, like free wifi and decent breakfast included.</p><br>Best western Plus las Vegas West<p>We have stayed here 2 or 3 times now on our way to Pheonix and have always had a nice room clean and a comfortable bed, the breakfast was good had nice choices. Check was quick and effecient and met our needs with a pet allergy. The location was great and not close to the strip which was even better.</p><br>Just the right distance away from the strip<p>Good hotel though no lifts so beware . In residential area a few miles from the strip very quiet close to shops and restaurants. Breakfast was fine usual continental breakfast. Indoor pool and spa a bonus.
Room Tip: No lift so ground floor if you have a disability or heavy luggage !

The beds in both rooms were HORRIBLE. They sagged 8 inches at edges but not in middle - we (in different beds) were rolling off the beds every night. Why this hotel was chosen - it is close to our family living in LV and our usual - Southpoint - is now charging resort fees and we no longer wish to deal with them. It took two days for my back to recover.</p><br>Great location if you're going to Vegas for Red Rocks<p>A comfortable and clean hotel with free breakfast, and one of the closest hotels to Red Rocks, if you're in Vegas to climb or hike rather than to visit the Strip.

The hot tub in the pool area was a wonderful place to soak our sore muscles after a day full Red Rocks' long approach trails.

The rooms are roomy, and the beds and showers are great. This will be our go-to hotel in Vegas from now on.</p><br>Excellent stay!<p>My family and I stayed here for memorial day weekend. We really enjoyed this hotel. The gentlemen at the front desk were very friendly, professional, and accommodating. The rooms are spacious and very quiet. The beds are very comfortable, and everything overall was very clean. We will definitely be staying here on our next visit to Las Vegas!</p><br>I loved my stay<p>This is a lovely, quiet hotel away from the crazy Strip. My room was large; had a king bed; and was well maintained. The whole property was smoke free. I used the indoor pool and jacuzzi; both were clean with windows on 3 sides. The breakfast was great! Lots to choose from and very tasty. There were an Outback, Burger King, Subway and Greek and Italian restaurants in the same complex. I felt I got a lot of value for the price, and would stay here again.
Only problem: the maintenance man was to check on the shower head--it only responded to one setting: mist all over--but nothing had changed the next day. I also suggest that the hotel add grab bars in the bathroom.
Room Tip: No elevator, so request a room on the lobby floor if you have mobility problems.

There are many excellent restaurants and shops in nearby Boca Park. It's not far from the strip or downtown Las Vegas. Plan to stay here for your next trip to Vegas. You won't regret it!</p><br>Great location and wonderful experience<p>I travel on a regular basis and found this property very quiet and clean. The staff is very friendly and accomodating. Great location right off the 215, adjacent to a retail center. All you need is within walking distance! I travel to LV on a regular basis and will continue to stay at this property. Thank you for a great experience - I'll be back!</p><br></body></html>
