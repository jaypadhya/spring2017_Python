<html><head><h3>BEST WESTERN PLUS Las Vegas West Hotel Reviews Page 2</h3></head><body><br>Great off the strip<p>Room is clean, comfortable, and has everything you need for a business or pleasure stay. Staff is friendly and helpful. Nice to have a mini fridge and microwave in the room. Close to restaurants and stores. Was close to where I needed to be for business.</p><br>Breakfast not what you expect<p>This hotel is clean and doesn't smell of smoke, which is good. The rooms were nice, beds and pillows good. It was pretty good. The breakfast is not as good as other BW Plus. And if the hotel is crowed, expect to wait. We will check with management about the breakfast before we stay here again.</p><br>Off strip basic hotel.<p>I stayed here recently for one night as I was passing through the Las vegas area. I am not a fan of Vegas at all, so didn't want to stay anywhere near the strip. This hotel is a little bit away from everything but easy enough to get into the centre of things and parking at all the major hotels...

Nice pool area, okay breakfast, nice (small) fitness room, the rooms were nice, clean, nice updated d√©cor, beds were a little soft but overall a very comfortable room.</p><br>Business hotel<p>Spacious room and very clean, fresh fruits provided for breakfast. The bed sheet was starched and clean. The staffs are friendly. the location is far away from the Strip if you plan to visit the casinos.</p><br>Vegas Wedding and Family Trip<p>This hotel is awesome. Staff is courteous and professional. Clean Hotel and nice neighborhood (Outback Steakhouse right out front literately steps away). They were very accommodating (I asked to be away from everyone due to daughter being a little rambunctious and floor level for accessibility for convenience. Also they have a full breakfast with a good selection (save money by...
More </p><br>Great Stay<p>The front desk girl was friendly and helpful and every encounter during my two night stay with the staff was similar to my first.

More </p><br>A Pleasure<p>The staff was perfect, friendly, knowledgeable, and professional. Everything was perfect, except that I found our king mattress kind of hilly. Rooms were large, spacious and very clean. Location was great (if you want away form the casino Vegas life).</p><br></body></html>
