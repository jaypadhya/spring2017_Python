Staff was very accommodating and professional. Good breakfast with espresso coffee. Highly recommend when in Vegas.</p><br>Great hotel!<p>Stayed at this hotel during our trip to Vegas. It's a really nice hotel in a quiet area of Vegas, away from the strip. Very nice large room for a reasonable price. The staff was also really nice. We had taken a red eye into Vegas and landed at midnight. They had a bunch of samples at the desk and I was able to get toothpaste and a razor right away! Breakfast was also good. Definitely recommend staying here!</p><br>Las Vegas<p>We were very satisfied with this hotel. Off the strip and downtown but close enough to be there in minutes. We were heading North out of town so this was very convenient. Our room was fantastic with a Jacuzzi in the room. The breakfast was standard but very fresh and well stocked. Would stay at this hotel again.</p><br>Nice place at an affordable rate<p>We had one of the handicapped equipped rooms on the 2nd floor (which is actually at ground level). Unfortunately we could hear every step in the room above us which was a bit annoying but that was pretty much the worst of it. Room was clean and smelled good. Towels and sheets were great and even the pool towels were nicely sized and not the postage stamp size that you often get. Breakfast is adequate, but this morning they were out of eggs/omelette so that was disappointing. Staff is friendly and courteous. Would definitely recommend this place to friends and consider staying here again.
Room Tip: Go for the top floor if you can.

Hotel was beautiful, breakfast in the morning was so good, the staff was exceptional, especially Jose who was the nicest most professional front desk employee I have ever met! I definitely will be back in vegas, and this my hotel of choice!</p><br>Quiet &amp; comfortable<p>Away from the Strip but within easy distance. Near Summerlin. No casino noise to deal with. Staff is very helpful. Rooms are comfortable and the breakfast has variety. Coffee always available whether in the breakfast room or in room where there is a Keurig and a refrigerator.
Restaurants at all levels within very easy walking distance. Bed and pillows comfortable. Only things missing were an in-room safe and a lighted make-up mirror. I definitely recommend for those who want to be away from the hubbub and noise of the Strip, and want to get around easily to the other areas of Las Vegas. There is a small in-door pool and gym. Free wifi.</p><br>Look no further!<p>Look no further when looking for a nice place to lay your head! The staff’s professionalism here is as or better than some overpriced hotel on the strip. The GM has been nothing short of amazing on every facet of her business. I have been a guest here since January due to business and can’t say enough good things about my stay. From the heated indoor pool to the quality of the high speed internet and the amazing breakfast this hotel does not disappoint!</p><br>Nice Location<p>This is a pleasant location a few miles west of the strip next to Summerlin. There are many restaurants of all types nearby from fast food (next door) to high end at Tivoli Village or Downtown Summerlin. Best of all, they do not charge the $25/day resort fee of the casino hotels.
Room Tip: The handicap rooms do not have a bathtub. Also the bathroom lighting was dim.

This location is excellent, close to everything and a short drive to the Downtown strips, yet convenient to cycling, the Red Canyon Park and other attractions, shopping and dining away from the downtown area. Will definitely stay here again and would recommend it to others coming in. Community atmosphere in the area.</p><br></body></html>
