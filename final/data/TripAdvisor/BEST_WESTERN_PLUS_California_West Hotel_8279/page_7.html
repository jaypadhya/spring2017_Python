Very helpful personnel and great full breakfast. Easy to get to without getting involved with traffic on the Strip. Will definitely stay there in the future when we are traveling with a planned stop in Las Vegas.</p><br>What a Value<p>We went on a recent mountain biking trip near Red Rocks and stayed here. I figured it would be a pleasant stay but nothing to significant. I have to admit they did a great job, well above my usual thought of a Best western. The hotel was nicely decorated and the staff was pleasant and professional. The room was large and well done. The breakfast came with the room and was well done. I would definitely stay here again. Good location too near many restaurants.</p><br>My Stay at BW Las Vegas<p>I have stayed at your Hotel in Las Vegas over 100 days in the last year and the front desk staff you have there are very well trained and professional . Carlos, Jose, and Mike do an excellent job in customer service and are also very helpful in any request that I had. Francisco also doses a great job in assisting in any issue that I have had in the room. Ericka Hines manages that property very well you are lucky to have her onboardâ€¦ I will continue to stay their anytime I am in Las Vegas</p><br>Great location &amp; staff!<p>This location is a perfect spot to enjoy Las Vegas away from the strip; incredible Moroccan restaurant next to the hotel was fabulous; hotel staff are very helpful and the upgraded room was comfortable. We would recommend this hotel to family & friends!</p><br>A great hotel in an out-of-the-way location<p>The ambiance of the hotel is comfortable and quiet .... far enough from the "busyness" of the Las Vegas Strip, yet close enough to make access uncomplicated. Staff is very friendly and courteous. Staying here was a breeze. Definitely will be back!</p><br>Great for corporate groups<p>I am not sure how this hotel would work for somebody coming to Las Vegas as a tourist and wanting to explore the Strip but it is certainly great for production crews. And even if not on the Strip there are plenty of restaurants in walking distance.
We were in the area several times this year needing up to 10 rooms and Erica the General Manager could not have been more helpful. We constantly had to make changes to dates, names and number of rooms for all these trips and she was always on top of it, responding to my emails even late at night and always patient with us and our changes. We also got a great group rate even during times when other hotels in the area were claiming to be too busy and selling at higher rates than usual. And her team at the front desk was just as helpful.</p><br>Another great stay!<p>I travel quite a bit for work. When traveling in the Las Vegas area, I always chose this hotel. The staff is friendly and attentive. The rooms are always clean and very confortable. I also like avoiding all the hustle and bustle of the Las Vegas strip. This location is great for getting away from all the traffic yet it is close enough to the Las Vegas Strip so you can be there in minutes.</p><br>Great place on Red Rock side of Vegas<p>We were traveling through Vegas, but didn't want to see "Vegas" with our family. Also wanted a good night's sleep, so we chose this hotel. It was close to Red Rock and in a very nice area. We asked for a quiet room and were put on the top floor, which was perfect and indeed quiet. I had read there was no elevator, but there was one and it was easily accessible. Maybe that's new. The breakfast was pretty average, though fresh cut fruit was a nice addition. Overall, a great stay, very clean, and a good night's sleep. Would definitely stay here again.</p><br>Good for the price<p>We stayed here one night and found it to be a clean basic hotel . We had requested an early check-in and arrived at 2:00 pm , check-in I believe was at 3, the young fellow at the front desk gave us a bit of attitude and told us we we early, even though it was obvious that the hotel was not busy at all as there were maybe five cars in the parking lot besides ours and no one was around besides us. I had requested a higher floor facing the front of the hotel when booking and what does he do but give us the lowest floor facing the back of the hotel, management may want to have a discussion with this guy regarding customer service. Other than the front desk guy with the attitude the rest was good. Our lower floor room was basic but clean, wifi worked great. We went to the morning breakfast and it was just ok, there were only a few people at breakfast( hotel was no where near capacity) and some of the items had been sitting a while as they were a bit cold and soggy but it did get us going in the morning.This place is a bit out of the way but a 15 minute drive and your on the strip, red Rock casino is only about a 10 minute drive away. I would look at this hotel as an option again as the price was right and it was clean.</p><br>Comfortable<p>We stayed her for two nights prior to moving into our new place. the rooms were very comfortable and clean. The staff was great and the pool was 24 hours. I would recommend this hotel to anyone. 5 stars</p><br></body></html>
