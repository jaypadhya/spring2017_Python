<html><head><h3>BEST WESTERN PLUS Las Vegas West Hotel Reviews Page 4</h3></head><body><br>Off the beaten path but worth it!<p>Carlos gave excellent customer service to us by cancelling one of the two days reservation (due to family illness). We enjoyed our one night stay. Clean and comfortable all around. A bit off the strip, but nice and quiet western side of town. And safe. Good a/c. All around a positive experience. Thanks Carlos!</p><br>What a Surprise<p>This is probably the nicest Best Western at which we have ever stayed. We arrived late and were very pleased to find that the Spa/Pool was open 24 hours. The Spa/Pool area was very clean the spa temperature was pleasantly warm and best of all there was no odor of chlorine as you often find at indoor spas. The room was nicely appointed and the little freezer even froze the water bottles that we had in our ice chest. Having arrived late we slept in and got to the breakfast area with only 20 minutes until close. The selection was extensive and the young lady who kept the area supplied continued to make sure everything was available until the end of the time the breakfast is offered. There were only 2 pieces of bacon left when we arrived and when we asked if they could make more they said certainly and after about 10 minutes there was enough bacon for all of the guests waiting for bacon. All of the personnel were friendly, helpful and knowledgeable. My wife and I were travelling with our 13 year old grandson.</p><br>Beautiful W. Las Vegas<p>A brand new hotel at a great price. Full breakfast with eggs, bacon, and many carb options!. Quiet, off the strip but lovely casinos nearby on Rampart Blvd. Super clean and apparently pet-friendly. All at a low, low price. We got this by calling the Best Western 800 number. The representative was professional and helpful.</p><br>Great find!<p>Not one of the big hotel names but this definitely met our needs for Vegas:

1. Great location - right in the middle of the strip: next to Venetian, opposite Mirage.

2. Spacious, clean and comfortable rooms.

3. Great value compared the 'big name' hotels. I've never understood why people pay a premium to stay in a room which is basically the same (and where you are mostly just sleeping unless you missed the point of Vegas!), especially when you can access most of what the expensive hotels have to offer without staying there.</p><br>Decent Lodging<p>I don't like the Las Vegas strip when here visiting relatives so this hotel was ideal for us. Traffic was far less than down on the strip. This is a good location for us. We have stayed here before and will probably stay again.</p><br>Clean and comfortable<p>We were in Las Vegas for just a night on route. What we didn't realize was that the town was packed for a huge convention. The hotels that still had rooms were farther out and priced high. This hotel on the west side of town had reasonable rates. It was near major roads so it was easy to get in and out of town. Plenty of restaurants near by, even Walmart and Walgreens were a short drive away. But the best part was the hotel itself. It was freshly remodeled and very nice. Breakfast was busy but well supplied. I'd definitely stay here again. It's set back in the parking lot behind Burger King. In fact, the BK sign covers up the hotel sign so it's easy to miss.</p><br>Not a quality stay in Las Vegas<p>This is one of the most unclean Best Western hotels we have stayed in. Usually, Best Western is very good. We booked three rooms, and all the rooms appeared as if the bathrooms had not been cleaned. One of the couples in our party refused to use their bathroom shower at all. We also heard another guest complaining to the front desk that his room was dirty. My advice would be that if you want a quality experience in Las Vegas, stay in a quality hotel on the Strip.</p><br>Very pleased <p>Very happy with the information I got at the counter and the girl was very helpful.
The prices are reasonable and it's a clean place nice environment. She let me check out the rooms and a very clean pool .</p><br>GREAT PLACE!<p>Nice hotel, very clean and comfortable, great staff, great service... Even when you have to drive a little bit from the strip, is SO WORTH IT! Quiet place and a little bit of everything really close to the hotel, FAMILY APPROPRIATE.</p><br>Expensive Experience<p>Location was perfect for us, well away from the strip with easy access to the interstate and food. We called ahead and said we would be in town early and could they accommodate us by changing or adding to our reservation. Our original reservation was for 5th and 6th of July, we got there 3rd and 4th and checked out on the 5th. We were billed for the additional two days so this stay wound up being double what we thought it would be. The hotel was full, so I’m sure our room was rented again… it’s my fault but just seems a little unethical to keep money for a room we didn’t use. For this reason, I will not stay in another Best Western hotel, even though it was a nice unit.</p><br></body></html>
