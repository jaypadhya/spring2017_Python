The staff was very friendly, professional. I loved the decor in the room, breakfast was good as well. Good rating overall. Great Experience hands down especially in Las Vegas.</p><br>The Best!<p>The service is one of the best I have ever encounter specially the manager Erika Hines going the extra mile to take care of our soccer team. we travel to Las Vegas every time we have a soccer event and stay at this particular Best Western for its location and to keep our players away from the casinos.
Great service and good food.
The pool been indoors is great at winter time.
We stay seven occasions and the service was always the best
From the room been service to the front desk always clean.
And the food for breakfast always ready and a very clean area.
The location makes very convenient for our players having stores open 24hrs.</p><br>A great option for Vegas<p>I was in town for a geocaching Mega event and was looking for something less expensive that was away from the Strip. I saw on TA that this hotel seemed to be in a good area and got strong reviews, so I booked here based on that Rec. Turns out the area was pretty nice and the hotel was much better than many Best Westerns I have stayed at before. Room was pretty typical but had some nicer amenities (better coffee maker, nicer soaps, etc). Also had custom maid service available, although I didn't use it. Using the key to activate the A/C was also an interesting touch. It was a very smooth, quiet, and comfortable stay. I'll definitely consider this hotel then next time I'm in Vegas.</p><br>The best stay in the west is at Best Western!<p>I was in town for my cousin's wedding. I stayed a week at this hotel and I enjoyed every moment of it. It felt like my home away from home. The property outside was nice and very clean. Same with the inside lobby. My room was spotless when I entered. You could mistake it for nobody ever being in there before I occupied it. The sheets were clean, the bathroom was spotless and everything was arranged neatly. The rates are very fair. Especially for the location where the hotel is at. On top of everything else, the customer service is a phenomenal. Everyone there was courteous, polite and attentive. They made me feel welcomed and made me feel that they wanted me there, to the point that I was sad to leave during my checkout. The manager, Erica Hines is pleasant and wonderful. She has a great location and a great staff under her. Next time when I come to Vegas, I'll stay nowhere else but at this Best Western location. Thank you for everything, Erica!</p><br>Broken Chair and Hair on the Wall Paper<p>We had two rooms. The first room had a broken desk chair and was across the hall from the breakfast area. We were moved to a larger room. That room had a hair stuck to the wallpaper in the bathroom. Not a pleasant experience. The breakfast room is dark and small. It felt very closed in.</p><br>EMF phoenix<p>We stayed here while attending my son's wedding. The rooms were very clean, spacious and quiet. The hotel staff were all helpful and good natured. Every member of our group found something they enjoyed for breakfast. I especially liked the cinnamon rolls. I'll definitely choose this hotel should I ever travel this way again,</p><br>Dave R<p>I had an extended stay for business and I want to recommend this Best Western on every aspect of hotel managment and service provided. Cleanliness, quiet location off the avenue, comfort, wireless internet access, morning breakfast, availability of restaurants nearby, and a great sleep every night. Just a great location in Las Vegas to get anywhere quickly. Erica Hines is the property manager and we got to know each other well during a 4-month stay. Anything that needed attention was promptly taken care of by Erica and her wonderful staff. I mean everything! I had no need to look elsewhere for accomodations. Thank you Erica!,...I had a great stay!
Room Tip: I enjoyed having the sun coming in my room in the afternoon. Ask for a west-facing room. Also, roo...

Clean, comfortable, good amenities for the price. Hot breakfast, not fancy, but far better than most in this price range or rating average. Jaccuzzi jets are weak & heat low, but it's indoors with a good pool. Safe area with close restaurants.</p><br>Friendly staff, great service<p>We really enjoyed our stay the staff was friendly and helpful. Front desk clerk Jose Luis was very helpful and his smile made our stay pleasant and welcoming. Location was perfect first time to Las Vegas and will definitely return this hotel.</p><br></body></html>
