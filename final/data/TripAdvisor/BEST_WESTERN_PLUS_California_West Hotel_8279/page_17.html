<html><head><h3>BEST WESTERN PLUS Las Vegas West Hotel Reviews Page 17</h3></head><body><br>Couldn't Be Better<p>For us, this was an ideal place to stay. Can't think of any suggestions for improvement. It's clean, quiet, comfortable, seemingly on the new side. Everything was up to par. The property is a long way from the freeway and the Strip, which folks should know.</p><br>Stay Vacation<p>We recently traveled to Calif. & stayed at 2 separate facilities. We saw a flyer that if you stayed at 2 separate Best Westerns that you would be entitled to $50.00 off your next visit if you signed up for their rewards plan. Well we did. With that being said, we decided to do a stay vacation in our home city of Las Vegas to take advantage of the offer. This Best Western was a great facility. The welcome we received from Jose at the front desk was terrific. The phones were ringing off the wall & the lobby was filling up, but he still maintained his composure. The room was clean and updated. The bed and the pillows were amazing. We decided to use the pool and the spa which was indoor a plus in Vegas. The next morning we decided to take in the breakfast that is free with our stay and it was amazing. Scrambled eggs, bacon, bagels, pastries, waffle maker the list goes on & on...SCRUMPTIOUS!!! This was by far the best breakfast and room that we have ever experienced at a Best Western. For those of you looking for a place to stay off the strip I would recommend this hotel. Keep up the good work!!!!
Room Tip: Great place to stay.

Even though LV is big and noisey, it was not noisey nor lots of traffic.</p><br>Best Western Plus, Las Vegas<p>I stayed here at the end of a 20 day toiur of Califirnia, Arizona and Nevada and it prooved to be an excellent stay with easy access to The Strip. it was comfortable, value for money and pleasant. A bonus was a very enjoyable dip in the Jacussi</p><br>nice and quiet<p>The location was great for us, away from the strip noise and in a nice area of town. Close to some of the local stores, gas stations and fast food, if that is what you want. Outback Steakhouse is right next door as well as a couple of other restaurants, can't remember their names. Once you get use to the streets the strip was easy to get find. Staff was very accommodating. The room was clean. The fitness room is small, but fine for getting a quick workout before starting you day. The complimentary breakfast was simple but nice. We did not use the pool so cannot comment on it other than to say it is an indoor pool which it would be very refreshing rather than being out in the Las Vegas heat. Will make this our place to stay on return trips.</p><br>A Winner<p>State this at the outset: This hotel is more than 5 miles from the Strip. If being on the Strip isn't a priority, I encourage you consider this great value. It's very clean, quiet, and comfortable. Lots of free parking. The front desk staff is friendly and helpful. The breakfast has everything you'd expect and it tastes great. The room has lots of light - plenty to read by. The a/c was up to the task of working in 100 degree temps. Bed is good and comfortable. Shower had good pressure. Didn't watch tv so can't comment on that.

Bottom line - a winning property well worth your business.</p><br>Quiet, ultra clean, and great breakfast<p>Very nice non-smoking hotel, quiet, clean (my allergies would tell me otherwise), excellent breakfast (make it healthy and choose fruits, oatmeal, and activia yogurt). It is close to a great true french bakery (la belle), and fresh affordable sushi (sushi mon). Quick drive to the main drag, but far away to have peace.
Room Tip: always ask for a quiet room away from noise.
See more room tips</p><br>Best Western<p>Best Western Hotels are good and I enjoy staying there whenever I go out of town or when I'm away from home. I have used them in the state I live and out of state also and my experiences have all been good so far.</p><br>We Came Back<p>Tucked away from busy streets in a reasonably safe-feeling area about 6 miles from the strip, we found this newer-appearing BW clean and quiet, with very comfortable bedding - we wish we could have taken the pillows with us. The Kurig coffee machine in the room actually produced some decent coffee.

The breakfast buffet area was cramped & busy but the attendant kept things clean & well stocked. As this was just an overnight / on the road sleepover, we didn't partake of the other amenities and cannot rate them.

This first stop on a 2-week road trip from California to Missouri & back was a no-brainer for our last stop on the way back home.
Room Tip: 2nd floor is the "ground" floor / lobby floor. Elevator to 1 or 3 is all the way at the en...

A little confusion on the airport shuttle pick-up at 5 am in the morning, mainly because of ongoing construction. Everything in walking distance. For the amount of time we spent there, room, bed and bathroom very clean, sleep peaceful, would go back there again, super value for the price.</p><br></body></html>
