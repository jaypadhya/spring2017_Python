<html><head><h3>BEST WESTERN PLUS Las Vegas West Hotel Reviews Page 26</h3></head><body><br>A quiet hotel, in a busy city<p>I have made frequent trips to Las Vegas in the past 7 years and either stay with my niece or at a pricey hotel on the Strip. Since my niece was in the process of moving to Colorado and I wasn't able to stay with her, I decided to try something off of the Strip. Best Western was "my jackpot". It's a very clean, and comfortable hotel. Check-in was a breeze, The bed was comfortable and the room was very clean. This hotel is located in a residential neighborhood, so it's very quiet. The Strip is only about 10 minutes away, so there are plenty of places to eat in between. I will stay here the next time I do Vegas. SEE? What happens in Vegas, doesn't always stay in Vegas.
Room Tip: There are no elevators in this hotel, so if you have a lot of luggage, make sure you request a 1st f...

Mirela; in the Breakfast bar; supper lady. Very friendly and does a great job making you feel like being at home away from home. One of the reasons that I keep coming back to this hotel.

Carlos and his brother Jose; Both are very friendly and helpful to show you the way around the hotel and the local area. very friendly and helpful...

The people make this hotel! You can stay in alot of different hotels in Las Vegas, but I keep coming back to the place that makes you feel like being at home.

An A+ rating for the people of this hotel....</p><br>Fantastic<p>I recently stayed here and I have to say that my stay was fantastic. from the people at the front desk being very helpfull to the cleanliness and quietness of the rooms. I would definitely stay here again and would also be very likely to recommend my friends to stay here as well!!</p><br>The guest service was great.<p>I came here to visit some friends for the weekend and stayed at this best western and like the title the guest service was great from when I entered to when I left. The guy at the front desk Carlos was super friendly when I was checking in and recommended a few places to go. The room I stayed in was good as well. I love that right in front of the hotel there was an outback steakhouse. All in all good trip and excellent guest service.</p><br>Great Stay But No Elevator<p>This is a very nice property, located next door to an Outback and serving the same kind of cinnamon rolls at breakfast that are served at Holiday Inn Express. (I really like those rolls :-). Convenient location and courteous staff. .The only drawback was no elevator so it could be a bit of work for some people. I recommend making sure your room doesn't require climbing stairs when you make your reservation.</p><br>Room Smelled Like A Sewer<p>Opened door and was greeted with the smell of feces. I closed the door and asked for a different room and was given one. The second room was fine but my stay was ruined after smelling the first room. Housekeeping should have noticed the smell!!!</p><br>Then hotel nice, Carlos is Wonderful!<p>This hotel is very nice. It is clean, quiet and the rooms are quite spacious. The real gem in this hotel is the front desk man, Carlos. Carlos made a very long day pleasant and enjoyable. I was in the Business Office working and saw firsthand how he showed the same kindness and courtesy to every person upon their arrival even though he was the only person working in an almost full hotel. I would definitely recommend this hotel for its beautiful indoor pool, small but adequate fitness room, spacious and comfortable rooms and beds; however every hotel should have a Carlos at the front desk.</p><br>Wonderful Hotel<p>My family stayed here while we were in town for the Mayor's Cup and I'm so happy we did! The hotel is centrally located between all of the major soccer fields which made it extremely convenient. The staff went above and beyond and exceeded all of our expectations. Breakfast was always hot and fresh with a variety of selections. The rooms were very clean and well kept with really comfortable beds. Although this hotel does not have meeting space the staff always allowed us to occupy the breakfast facility in the evenings for team gatherings and crafts. I want to thank the entire staff at the best western plus for making our experience an enjoyable one. We will continue to book here whenever we find ourselves traveling to Las Vegas!</p><br>Pleasantly surprised.<p>Wished we would have booked our whole Las Vegas trip here. Very clean. Nice to wake up to coffee in your room. Staff very pleasant. Breakfast was good too. If your looking for a room without the cigarrette smell throught the hallways then this is the spot. Felt very comfortable and safe. Minutes away from the strip.</p><br>Great Value. Attentive Staff<p>Nice rooms, attentive staff. Enjoyed my stay. Recommend for anyone looking for somewhere nice to stay out without paying for the strip prices. This is my third time staying here and will continue to stay here everytime i am in town.</p><br></body></html>
