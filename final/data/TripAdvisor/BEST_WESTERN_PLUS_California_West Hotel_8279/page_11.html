<html><head><h3>BEST WESTERN PLUS Las Vegas West Hotel Reviews Page 11</h3></head><body><br>Lovely Pet Friendly Hotel<p>The purpose of our trip was to close out my mother's house after her recent passing. For a variety of reasons, we were not going to stay in the house for this trip so we needed a hotel that accepted pets. We were very satisfied with the experience at the hotel including a nice breakfast and a 24 hour pool/spa.</p><br>life changing<p>when i first arrived to las vegas i was a quite, no self esteem,wanted to be alone, and never wanted to communicate with nobody, the only reason i was out here was for my company work, (originally from arizona), but being here for a little less then 6 months, that all has changed, the staff is so friendly, you would think they where one of your friends or best friend at that, there honest,caring, and pasionate about there work, when i see them, a hi and bye isn't good enough for them, they want to ask how your day was,how are you feeling, etc. its great, actually so great that iv even considered moving to las vegas just to hang out with the best western friends,not to mention everything is so excellent not just the customer service, the rooms are phenomenal, nice brand new comfy beds,the shower feels amazing, i have been traveling a lot with the company,and this best western is by far the best hotel iv ever stayed at. i thank everyone for being so friendly and professional, could not ask for a better place to stay :)
Room Tip: room 119 is good, but 116 is where my heart is :)

I liked that it had the sink separate from the toilet/shower-tub area. The bed was comfortable. In addition to the usual Continental Breakfast fare, they offered 4 hot items that changed each day - scrambled eggs, biscuits and gravy, bacon, cinnamon rolls, sausage, fried potatoes, etc. Instead of a waffle maker they had a pancake maker that made very good pancakes.</p><br>Top quality motel in prestigious Summerlin area<p>Perhaps the term "motel" is demeaning as the comfort and convenience of this accommodation matches top-notch "hotels" that are much more expensive and less in overall value for your money. Location in the Summerlin area is a big plus for those looking to be away from the glitz on the Strip. Without exception the staff were very helpful. They will provide a warm welcome for your next stay in Vegas!</p><br>Off the strip<p>Place is decent, we always stay at Best Western. Had an issue with the thermostat for the 5 days I was there, really cold in the room and hall felt much warmer. Breakfast not so good, really disappointed to the point I left the hotel twice and got breakfast elsewhere. Last day they served biscuits but no gravy, what's the point? I had the Do Not Disturb sign on my door all week, I didn't really need anything and was working all day. Last day a maid blew off the Do Not Disturb sign and walked into my room while I was there. Didn't give me a warm fuzzy feeling that my privacy was being respected during the other days I was working.</p><br>Very Satisfactory Experience<p>The rooms are big and very clean. We stayed in a 2 queens beds that are very comfortable. The service is great! I would highly recommend this hotel to everyone I know who would happen to be travelling in Las Vegas, but don't mind not being on the Strip. The area is very safe and very quiet.</p><br>Best Western Plus Sahara<p>Loved the hot tub and pool being available 24 hours (indoor pool). Loved the free breakfast and enjoyed the friendliness of the staff. Easy to located. Close to anything you might want to do and food places easily available. Quiet and restful.</p><br>Wonderful Stay<p>The staff was very professional and friendly. The room was very nice and clean and the beds were very comfortable. The breakfast was amazing. Nothing bad to say about our stay. Would definitely stay there again.
Room Tip: choose the suit with the king bed and separate bath tub, better amenities

Our room was as excellent as it was in September. The bed was SO comfortable with a pillow top. This is amazing to me as other hotels usually have a basic bed that, to me, feels like a rock! I have a bad back and the mattress is so comfy that I can wake up refreshed and backache-free. I also am impressed with having a Keurig coffee maker in the room and a yummy breakfast downstairs in a breakfast room close to the lobby. As far as we're concerned. we will go to this hotel every time we come to visit our daughter and the grandkids.
Room Tip: We liked being on the 3rd floor but the 2nd floor would have been fine. My husband is disabled so an...
