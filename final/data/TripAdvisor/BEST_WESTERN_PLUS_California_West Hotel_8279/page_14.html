<html><head><h3>BEST WESTERN PLUS Las Vegas West Hotel Reviews Page 14</h3></head><body><br>Nice quiet Best Western<p>If you want to stay away from the noisy busy strip, this is a good place to stay. Friendly staff, clean rooms. Unfortunately for a hot place like Vegas,where air conditioning is a must, the air conditioning units are old and very noisy. They are in dire need of being upgraded to new units.</p><br>Great stay<p>This hotel has an incredibly friendly and helpful staff. Everything you need is here; a gym, hot breakfast, microwave, fridge and coffee maker in the room... you'll be happy here. You're also walking distance from about 100 restaurants and a stores.</p><br>Very Loud A/C Unit<p>My wife and I stayed in this hotel on 9/17/14. The desk clerk and staff were very nice and efficient. Price was right and room was very clean. Decor a bit dated, but we can't have everything. Very convenient to an Outback Steakhouse. Breakfast was nothing special - just OK.
The kicker was the A/C unit in the room. It was very loud and kept my wife from being able to sleep. She refuses to use earplugs, but mine worked just fine and I slept OK. Bed was comfortable.
I'd stay here again - but I'd try to remember to check the A/C before we got settled in.
Room Tip: Check the A/C unit noise as soon as you get in the room.

This hotel was perfect! Very clean, modern and comfortable room with amenities so great my husband wanted to stay another night! Staff are professional and friendly. Outback Restaurant next door is a plus for good meal.</p><br>Away from the Strip<p>A great property if you want to stay away from the craziness of the Strip. On the west side of Las Vegas, probably 20 minutes to downtown. Very clean, spacious, quiet, pleasant staff. Well priced. A really good, suburban, business traveller property (although I was travelling for pleasure). Good breakfast included w. healthy food options. Property is in a small mall and located a bit off of West Sahara Avenue and signage not great - look for the street numbers on adjacent properties to guide you.</p><br>Great value<p>Called from the road and they had a suite available. Great price, excellent value! Clean room with 2 beds and a pull out couch. Very clean and friendly staff. Breakfast was really good. Nice place to stay, especially if you are looking for a place off the strip.</p><br>Like home with family<p>Every time I go to Las Vegas I stay at the Best Western Plus Las Vegas West. They treat you like family, the rooms remodeled clean and taken care of very well. They make cookies in the evening so when you come in you can help your self to fresh baked cookies. One time I came in late and the cookies weren't ready, after about 15 minutes, I received a call from the front desk calling to let me know the cookies were fresh from the oven. That's family. The people are very friendly and helpful. This like a second home away from home. I would recommend it to everyone.</p><br>Work stay (abraham)<p>One of the best places I've been. Staff is very friendly and helpful. Place is kept immaculate! The rooms are awesome and always kept in really great condition. Facilities are kept in tip top shape and taken care of.</p><br>Very comfortable..we will be back!<p>My husband and I were visiting our daughter and her family, who recently moved to Las Vegas, over the Labor Day holiday. We stayed at this hotel which was not only very convenient to our family, but very comfortable and clean. The beds were THE most comfortable I have ever slept on in a hotel. We have stayed at numerous Best Western hotels over the years, but by far, this is the best one. We already have reservations for Christmas here and am looking forward to having a wonderful holiday.</p><br>The Best Bang for Your Buck<p>This hotel is very nice and quiet. The Staff is very friendly and helpfully. The rooms are very nice and not to mention the comfort of the bed and pillows. I always get a good night rest when staying here and to top it off the breakfast is awesome as well.</p><br></body></html>
