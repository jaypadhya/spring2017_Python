<html><head><h3>Circus Circus Manor Motor Lodge Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 13</h3></head><body><br>Hotel is great and full of adventure<p>I have stayed at this hotel several times and have never had a problem seeing homeless people outside of this hotel as I have seen posted in a previous review. This hotel has a lot to offer for adults as well as Children. Adventurdome, which consists of ROLLERCOASTERS, BUMPER CARS, AND GAMEROOMS ARE VERY ENJOYABLE! This hotel is a bit older than most and it is a bit further than the rest of the casinos, but for the price you can't beat it. It's safe, relaxing, and entertaining.. If you don't plan on being in your room and enjoying Vegas, this hotel will be a great option for you.</p><br>Excellent - no complaints<p>It's been quite a while but I did not know about Trip Advisor back then. The only reason that I am writing this now it because I can not understand why there are so many negative reviews. There were four of us in two connecting rooms and it was the second consecutive year that we stayed there. We chose the Manor over the Tower since the Manor is so convenient when you have a car. As it was a while ago, I really don't remember any details but I do remember that we had absolutely NO problems or complaints at all and enjoyed our 4 night stay.</p><br>Beware the elevators<p>We stayed in the Circus, Circus towers. I would not recommend it to anyone. It was not clean and we were stuck in the elevator for 1/2 an hour. It was cheap but now I know why. The bright spot was the scene of the mountains in Las Vegas.</p><br>On the strip, basic hotel<p>I stopped over in Vegas on the way home for a wedding, and stayed three nights. Does this compare to the MGM or the HIlton? No way, but it's on the strip, and a very basic place for a low rate. It served its purpose and my air conditioning and hot water worked.</p><br>OMG, DON'T COME KNOCKING IF THE TRUCK IS ROCKING!!<p>My wife and I were staying at the Circus Circus last week. Besides all the substandard qualities of the hotel, we were surprised when we looked out the window of our room. There in the parking lot was two people bumping nasties in the back of a pickup truck in the parking lot. Apparently they preferred better accomodations than those we had to pay for at the Circus Circus!! Do Not Stay Here!!</p><br>Poorly constructed with paper thin walls<p>We stayed for three nights - never again. Dogs barking in the next room, doors slamming up and down the corridor all night, which happens a lot in 24 hour Vegas
The paper thin walls combined with connecting doors means that anything above a whisper can be heard by the neighbours.
Because it is so out of the way buried in the RV park, it takes ages to actually walk anywhere, like the lobby, let alone the front of the hotel.
We moved after three nights to a Rodeway just off the strip. Free coffee, cable TV, breakfast included, bigger, quieter rooms, free WiFi and staff that were there to help.
Would NEVER go back to Circus-Circus again!</p><br>100%- cant understand the other reviews<p>I am actually stunned about other's comments about this hotel. I couldnt fault the hotel at all, thought it was fantastic. Food was great, staff were lovely and the size of the hotel added to the excitement. We were there for 5 nights and did not have one night bad sleep. Yeah its cheap, and a bit too far down the strip, but the rate we paid for Circus Circus was beyond a joke, you wouldnt get one night in a hotel in Ireland for the same rate.
I would recommend anyone to go to this hotel, its cheap, clean and full of life. Not exactly 5 star, but great all the same</p><br>Past sell by date but adequate<p>A certain faded elegance. As might be expected filled with kids, parents, club, stag and hen parties enjoying themselves. If this sounds too much our room in the tower was isolated from the tumult below. Again the room was large with all the usual facilities a bit faded and tatty but perfectly adequate. The food in various restaruants was of a good standard, the buffet style breakfast was the usual vast bewildering display of food you find in America, you yearned for a simple choice after a few days. This hotel is a vast conveyor belt catering for the mass budget experience. We enjoyed our stay it was totally different from the British experience and mirrored the rest of Las Vegas, vast noisy but interesting in a bizarre sort of way</p><br>RUN AWAY AS FAST AS YOU CAN!!!<p>Ok we have stayed a Circus Circus before in the towers. They were nice. So when we book a last minute night at Circus Circus they said all we have is the manor lodge. Ok I figured that the rooms should be about the same. Well no they are not. First the door was in very bad shape. The hall smelled like throw-up, urine and dead something or another. When we entered the room most of it was clean accept well one bed was messed up and not to mention the room was used for prostitution. Yep because there were things I cannot see that was in there. So we called the front desk and they said that they had no other rooms. But they can send someone up to clean the room. So they sent in a Hispanic woman that did not speak English. She was only going to change the pillows. Then I had to tell her no change the whole bed. She took off the top bedding and left the bloody and other fluid soaked sheet on the bed and began to put bedding on top of that. So at this point I said not take everything off and replace it. So she had to go get new bedding and replace everything.
The shower was cold, and the toilet was clogging. Dirty floor, found a used condom under bed, the TV came from the 1970's wooden panel on the side and all and no remote. Could not go out at night because there were people banging on the doors so that scared us. Fighting and the sounds of people having relations next door. The wall paper alone was just wrong, ugly 1970's gold. Do not stay here.</p><br>DISGUSTING!!<p>With the dirty carpets, lumpy beds, horrid bathrooms that were beyond a "refresh", even cheap rates do not justify staying in such a horrid property. Had to stay three nights with family, all the rooms were equally bad. We could not wait to get out of that smelly place!
Will never make the mistake of staying there again.</p><br></body></html>
