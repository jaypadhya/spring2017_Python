<html><head><h3>Circus Circus Manor Motor Lodge Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 10</h3></head><body><br>You can do better. Really!<p>PROS: -cheap. booked online for $25 + $9 resort fee.
-clean, mostly.
-spacious room with obviously new furniture and TWO safes, one old one new, both no charge to use.
CONS: -no fridge/micro, contrary to previous reviews. The desk clerk said that mini fridges & microwaves violate fire code and no Las Vegas hotel offers them (except in the residential "suite" types.) Shame, too, because that seems to have been the only advantage over Circus Circus's other rooms and was the reason I'd chosen to stay there. There WAS an empty minibar which they were careful to call a "cooler" as it only reaches about 50° (and is therefore in compliance with the fire code, I guess?) Better than nothing but I really needed a microwave.
-clean, mostly - except the bed linens. The bed was unmade and the sheets were stained (i will leave you to speculate with what, I did not care to investigate.) Called the desk, was promised a visit from housekeeping. I feel I should clarify that everything ELSE was clean.
-the AC's not very powerful. I don't carry a thermometer but I don't need science to tell me that room wasn't 65°. Not a big deal to me but... fyi.
-arguing/swearing adults in the hall and the scent of weed. I don't care about the weed but keep your arguments to yourself.

Overall the Manor feels like it used to be a separate unrelated property, annexed by Circus Circus just so they could have more rooms. I guess that IS cheaper than building another tower, but damn.

Oh, and I have read various things about what the "resort fee" entitles you to, but as of this writing, you get only ONE free drink, at Rock & Rita's, value up to $5.75. You also get free wifi (useless to me but...), two gym passes (ditto), and two free rides and two midway games (likewise), and many coupons for discounts on souvenirs and stuff. This place seems to be designed to siphon money from your wallet-- oh, wait, never mind. I guess I forgot I'm in Vegas!</p><br>GOOD FOR THE BUDGET-MINDED<p>My sister, niece and I stayed at the Manor Motor Lodge for 4 days over spring break. Other than the carpet needing steam-cleaned I have no complaints about the room. We did have trouble getting enough towels at the beginning. Only 2 were in our room and there was a housekeeping person on the floor at the time we notice so we went to get another towel from her. We were told they are only supposed to leave 2 in each room so we would have to call housekeeping everyday to get the extra. We thought that strange as the Manor is supposed to be where the families stay, which would suggest more than 2 towels needed. However, on days 3 and 4 we were being left plenty of towels without having to call for them. Other than that weird trouble, it was quiet. Would stay there again if on a budget.</p><br>Avoid the Motor Lodge<p>We stayed in the casino towers last year, and at the time I was surprised that it was perfectly acceptable. After reading the poor TripAdvisor reviews, I had been expecting worse. So when we returned this year and needed a place to stay we grabbed a spot here since it was pretty inexpensive. Ah ha! This time we ended up in the Motor Lodge...that is where all the negative reviews come from. It reeked! We kept the window wide open and put all comforters in the closet. That helped, but didn't solve the problem. Avoid the motor lodge. It also took us about 1.5 hours in the check in line at mid-afternoon on a Sunday.</p><br>More than expected.<p>No complaints. For the price you can't go wrong. For being an older hotel, they have done a good job keeping it in shape. Staying away from the main casino worked out well. No smoke smell and no noise. I would definately stay again.</p><br>Good place to stay if you want to save money on a room.<p>Quite, clean, and very few extras. Also a little far from the main Casino and the Strip. But for the price it's a pretty good deal. Also great if you want free parking and easy in and out.</p><br>Deteriorating...and they've removed refrigerators!<p>It has been a family tradition since 1993 to stay at Circus Circus. This latest visit was my 7th. We have stayed all over the facility including the towers and RV park but have come back to the Manor several times for convenience. It is of course easier to get to your car without winding your way through a casino and until recently all manor rooms included a refrigerator. When I called to ask about the fridge I was told (somewhat rudely) that they had been removed and now came at a charge of $15 a day (with an 8 day stay we could've bought our own fridge from Wal-Mart and kept it for close to this money!). After a debate in which I pointed out that their NEW picture on the website for the manor is misleading as it shows the room with a fridge the manager caved and gave us one complimentary.

They have done SOME renovations in the rooms, new cabinets... new pictures. This is about the extent of it. The carpet (in the WHOLE building) still needs replacing desperately as it is currently holding on to decades worth of smells. Also the bathrooms are in need of work, shower curtains are pretty gross, and we discovered that if the room above us flushed their toilet, water (clean) would leak onto the floor of our bathroom. Maids also had no consideration for guests, often having very loud, laughter filled conversations right outside our door. Elevators are pretty grim too.

Overall right now I think Circus Circus needs to really pick up their game before they go the way of so many other hotel/casinos in Vegas. To be honest I believe the only thing saving them right now is the Adventuredome.

Despite tradition... next visit we will look at staying somewhere else, where they don't money grub over a fridge and the carpets don't smell like 30 years worth of cigarettes.</p><br>An OK place to stay<p>Have stayed twice, Oct. and Nov of 2011 and would stay again. It is an older place, but we knew that going in. Remember, you get what you pay for, it isn't fancy but is neat and clean. Enjoyed being able to park close and keep an eye on the car.</p><br>typical motel fare<p>Lets just start off by saying, its cheap. If it wasn't cheap then no one would go there.

Its not a hotel, its definitely a motel...and its old.

The good: cheap, free wifi, free parking.

It was quiet while we were there (most people were staying in the real hotel). In fact, we were a little isolated back there. We didn't see any bugs. The rooms were cleaned daily.

The bad: the drains were plugged up, the furniture is old, the carpet is worn out, the building is out in the back lot of the hotel.

The gym at circus is old with worn out machines.

The line up to the front desk is the longest that i've ever seen--its like an airport.

The hotel's location is far away from the centre of the strip.

What really bothered us was the smoking--everywhere--the lobby, the casino, the restaurants....</p><br>Lizzie and Lan 4 nights in vegas<p>The manor motor lodge is a 2 storey buidling on the opposite side of the road from the main hotel, we did not choose this but it worked well becuase we were visiting friends and they could park outside each day to pick us up. However, parking in the hotels is easily accessible, plentiful and free.
We had stayed here before in the main tower, so we knew in advance that this Hotel itself is by no means plush, so if you want luxury choose somewhere else, if you want a big room and the basics then its fine.
Dissapointing on arrival that we our room had not been cleaned fully, it looked as though the maid had been distracted halfway through, the carpet was not vacumed, the fridge still had food remains of the previous guests, and there was rubbish in one of the drawers. We did report this to reception, but the time it would have taken for someone to come and sort this out would have meant us staying in the room, and as we were fighting off the jet lag and wanted to keep on the move, we found a vacum cleaner and sorted it out ourselves. The bathroom and toilet were v clean and that was the important part for us,also clean sheets and good pillows. we did notice a sweet stuck to the bed spread! but again just took the covers off and got on with it. Once we got this sorted the room was great with all the things we needed. comfotable queens size beds, fridge almost full size, ironing board and iron, and decent hairdryer that actually blows hot air! it was cleaned well each day with fresh towels daily.
There are plenty of places to eat in the hotel although we only used the deli 1 day for breakfast preferring to venture out to places with more pleasant surroundings. Interestingly smoking is allowed in all the casinos, and it makes you realise how lovely it is here at home to have a smoke free zone when you are eating.
The circus acts are fun to see and run until 10.30pm, nothing specctacular but worth looking at.
there is a 2:1 offer on a different beer each night, but if you can stand the 'smell' of the casino hall, which unlike the other is rather smelly, you can take the bottles back to your room.
There is a bus service for $7 all day ticket or $5 for 2 hours, that takes you up the strip and you can hop on and off as you please, the taxi is around $10 to $15 from hotel to Mandalay Bat right at the other end of the strip.
As ;long as you go prepared that this is not luxury in any way, then you will be okay.
Room Tip: have stayed in both the tower and the motor lodge and rooms are identical

This is a motel setting close to the Main Circus Circus area. close parking to your room so you don't have to drag luggate etc from the larger parking garage. Nice large clean rooms with new furniture, refrigerator and microwave plus lock box. I paid 28.00 + 7.95 resort charge (which gives you WiFi among other things) + hotel tax or a total of $40.26 for 2 people. can't beat that in Vegas.
The coupoun pack they give you was mostly worthless for us but probably good for families with young kids because it includes a couple of adventure rides in the main tent.
Room Tip: Ask for first floor rooms so you don't have to use the elevators to 2nd or 3rd floors.
