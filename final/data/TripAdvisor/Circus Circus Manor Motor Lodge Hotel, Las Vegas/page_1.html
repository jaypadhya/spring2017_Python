<html><head><h3>Circus Circus Manor Motor Lodge Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 1</h3></head><body><br>Yuck<p>We had stayed here years ago and figured it would be a nice stop for the night before we moved on to other ventures . We were wrong . The place is filthy , the carpet is disgusting . The windows on the doors are dirty filthy , I hated to have to touch the door . The wallpaper in the halls is peeling off and looks nasty . We had booked 4 nights at the end of our holiday, but cancelled that because of the state of the place that smelled old, musty and awful . No thank you. I would suggest giving this place a miss .
Room Tip: Choose any room at another hotel !

The whole lodge smelt a little of smoke, but the room was clean. If you aren't going to be in the room much, then this lodge would be fine.</p><br>If you're able, do not stay in this dive.......<p>I booked in this place for 3 nights because the actual Circus Circus Hotel was full. This place is like a highway motel except the price was quadruple 3 nights for $ 350.00 US is a rip off. The first night they forgot to clean the bathroom although they made the bed. The second night they forgot cleaning the room altogether. When I called housekeeping they said to me "really" ? but no apologize whatsoever. As they didn't clean they also didn't replenish the coffee and when I called again, I had to wait over one hour before it arrived. I complained inside the hotel to a supervisor, again.....sometimes that happens and again, no apology. Luckily, after 3 days I was able to move to the Westgate.
Never, never again will I stay there. And remember, they charge you the regular Hotel fees plus Resort fees although you sleep in the Motel behind the hotel.
Room Tip: Do not book here.........
See more room tips</p><br>Not Horrible<p>While it's old and showing its age, the rooms aren't so bad. It's Las Vegas, exactly how much time do you spend in the room.

The price was reasonable but $20+ in a daily resort fee is borderline insanity.</p><br>Bugs, dirty sheets and blankets Third World<p>So nasty! I wish we could force the family members of the president or ceo of this circus to stay here a few weeks. THIN WALLS, bugs, far away from the hotel, tatty everything... wall cooler rattling. This is for poor people with no class. A step above a homeless shelter. Greediness keeps this place open. They invest zero money into upkeep. Just go bankrupt and tear this shanty down.</p><br>Total rip off<p>They mislead the name of circus circa hotel and casino and then room category motor manor, which is kind of a motel behind the original circus circus hotel and casino. On top of that they charge resort fee. I was pissed off when get there and know this then they promise me to give me room in original hotel tomorrow but every time I went there they said no room available so had to stay in that motel. When you exit from your room weed smell welcomes you, dirty and dark like dungeon.
I never ever book or stay in that hotel again.
Room Tip: Don't book with name of Circus Circus Motor Manor Lodge
See more room tips</p><br>Scary Circus Circus<p>If I would give this hotel 0 stars if possible. We booked this room on Expedia. We thought we were staying at the main hotel. The room was old and dated. It smelled like cigarette smoke. It was terrible! The main lobby was old and dated and the casino was full of scary people. Horrible experience!</p><br>Not really good<p>Arrived at circus circus and it looked like an airport. People sitting and sleeping on the ground waiting to check-in. When we Finally could go to our room, manor E, it took us some time. It was a long long walk and we had no idea where to go.. What a shame. Manor E is not really in the main hotel anymore but outside the building all the way at the end. This hotel is not personal in any way and I couldn't find anybody for help.

For kids it is a lot of fun tho and I guess the location and price is not bad. But the rooms are old and smelly as well.</p><br>OLD, SMALL AND NOT VERY COMFORTABLE<p>Small and very old would not stay here again. It was not very comfortable either. Upon entering the hotel to check in, we were 'accosted' by a rep to sell us a timeshare. I don't like that kind of service. The only thing that was worth anything was the Adventuredome for my grandkids.</p><br>Worst hotel I've stayed in<p>This was such a let down. We booked through a travel agent who said we would be staying in the circus circus building. When we found out it was this dodgy place I asked to upgrade happy to pay more but it was booked out so we'll try again tomorrow.
The room stinks like smoke. The whole building is old and run down. There are kids running around screaming and playing hide and seek in the hallways. Had to go buy some disinfectant wipes just to use the toilet.
I was reallly looking to Vegas, but this has been the worst part of our holiday so far.</p><br></body></html>
