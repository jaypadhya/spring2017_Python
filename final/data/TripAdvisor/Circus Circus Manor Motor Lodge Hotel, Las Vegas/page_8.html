The price was cheap and I knew it was older, but it was clean and no big issues in my room. The buffet was good and probably average priced but convenient for tried feet. The free Wi-Fi was nice, the TV had a lot of channels, the bed was fine and check-in was pretty quick.
The only con I saw was no vent fan in the bathroom. I can deal with that.
Room Tip: Ask questions before you reserve.

This was by far the worst. I was greeted by gruesome stained carpets and grungy, smudged wallpaper, plus a vicious chemical stench piped through the ventilation in the hallways. Filthy piles of laundry on the bed when I checked in, many light bulbs burnt out, safe didn't work, no CNN on the TV system, then the TV stopped working. I called for repairs or exchange every day for 3 days, every day they sent a technician out, and still the problems persisted. Was unable to do the express checkout. When I mentioned all of this to a supervisor at the front desk, I got "Oh." Zero customer service. "$150 in promotions" were useless. Ripoff, stroke job "resort fee" (resort? hah!) with tax was $10 a day, this was not apparent on the mobile app. Bad location at wrong end of the Strip in a seedy neighborhood with endless drugged out panhandlers. Long, long walk to the next hotel. Buffet was vomitrocious. Next time: Luxor!</p><br>Don't Stay Here!<p>My wife called and wasn't told she was dealing with HotelSavings.com. She thought she was getting Circus Circus but we ended up in Manor. Old, outdated rooms. Were supposed to be in non-smoking wing but you could smell smoke everywhere. Lots of kids running the halls all through the night. Did not feel safe in parking lot due to lack of lights. When they asked for our feedback and I gave it to them they just dismissed our comments.</p><br>RV Park<p>Do not bother, place is a dump. Premium site is little more then a small patch of grass with a half dead olive tree. Which they do not bother to clean up the Olives that are now stuck to the bottom of my shoes. Pavement is little more then gravel, maybe the State of Nevada can show them what pavement should look like, at least the drive n on I 15 was smooth</p><br>Old, outdated, smelly<p>I had stayed at circus circus before and never in the manor....it is a bit of a walk from the main hotel, after a long day on the strip a golf cart shuttle would be nice, the place had such a small bathroom you had to go outside to change your mind, the beds were old and horriable. The smell of cleaning products to cover up the mildew and old smell were awful. Needs a whole lot of TLC
Room Tip: Stay in the main hotel, not the manor
See more room tips</p><br>Yucky<p>We booked through Expedia and were told that we had a room at Circus Circus, no mention at the time of booking of Manor Motor Lodge. We stayed for a week, our room was flooded by a faulty shower so we were moved but still had to call maintenance 3 other times because of problems with the room. As you walk into Block C you are overwhelmed by the smell of a cheap, sweet air 'freshener' - God knows what that's masking. The room was really dusty and the power sockets didn't seem to like travel adapters. This hotel doesn't seem to fit in with modern Vegas and is crying out for the wrecking ball. The casino looks more like an amusement arcade in Blackpool or Yarmouth.
On the plus side, the staff were friendly but when I go back to Vegas, it'll be The Venetian or Paris for me!</p><br>Wonderful<p>The Circus Circus Manor Rooms in Vegas are really nice, clean, modern, quiet.
I really enjoyed my recent stay there.

Really impressed, very nice hotel registration folk
They were very helpful in every area
The bell folk were very nice

I really like circus circus
Room Tip: Really good
See more room tips</p><br>Not woth it<p>My family and I decided to leave a day early on are trip so we needed a cheap place to stay at. I wish we would have stayed home. The bed was so bad you could feel to springs popping up. The bathroom had so much water damage the wallpaper was coming off the walls and my husband pull the wallpaper back a little and a baby roach crawled out :-p The walls are so thin that the guy next door was snoring so loud it was like he was in bed with us. The only good was the kids enjoyed the games amd the circus show.</p><br>Needed Therapy After Staying Here<p>I have never been more traumatized by a hotel experience in my entire life. Spend the extra money and stay someplace far, far, far away from this cesspool. It'll be cheaper in the long run since you won't have to pay for the therapy sessions you'll inevitably have to attend to cope with your PTSD from the dried urine on the floor and curly hairs in the bedsheets. I believe my stay at the Manor Motor Lodge was God's punishment to me for being cheap. Next time, I'll just beg him to send me straight to Hell. There may be fire and brimstone but at least that guarantees it'll be sterile.
Room Tip: Get a room in a different hotel.
See more room tips</p><br>This is a DUMP!<p>Okay, so from what I am reading, a lot of other people got sort of "conned" into this hotel and I am no exception. We booked a trip through gate1travel.com and when you are booking they give you the options for hotels. The default booking is for Circus Circus, NOT Circus, Circus Manor Motor Lodge. It says three stars and even says this on gate1's travel site: "The rooms are fitted with contemporary decor and furnishings. All rooms are equipped with amenities that will be sure to make your stay pleasant, such as internet access (surcharge), a hair dryer, and a television with cable channels."
We looked up Circus Circus, saw it was nothing special, but alright and went for it...and found out that in fact, we were in the Manor Motor Lodge.
Now, I KNOW that this is gate1's fault and I'll be taking it up with them as well. Also, I want to point out that on my second night, I complained and they put us in a suite for the night, so this is nothing against the overall hotel, but there are still a few things people need to know staying here.
Rooms: They are DUMPS in the manor motor lodge. I asked, when we were checking in, if those rooms had been redone at all and was told that "all the rooms have been updated in SOME way"...well I don't know what way this room had been updated. The carpets were worn and stained. The bedding was the polyester crap from the 80s. The wallpaper was stained and peeling off the walls. The bathroom floor had cracks in the tile and a permanent grunge that could never been cleaned. It looked like a motel room you see in horror movies!
The hallways were constantly loud and smelled of marijuana, with cheap, apple air freshener over top, which was interesting because of the number of small children running around with distinctly trashy families. I even made a joke with a cab driver in Las Vegas, that we were NOT ugly enough to be staying in this hotel. He agreed and said it was the butt of the joke of cabbies on the strip. Good to know.

Hotel: The hotel amenities are geared towards children, but are basically a money grab. There is a small, indoor amusement park that costs something like $8/30 second ride. There are shops and restaurants, but non are high end. We ate at three places while there and overall they were crappy. I'll give those individual ratings though.

Service: This was very good actually. I had a very pleasant bell hop help us out and all the wait staff and cleaning staff were very nice and the woman whom I complained to was very receptive and polite, so that earns them an extra star.

The thing with the hotel is that even these rooms we were stuck in, fall under 3 stars, even though they, by themselves, would barely qualify as 1 star rooms, because the whole hotel falls under one heading.

SO, lesson to be learned, these rooms are NOT nice rooms. The hotel is considerably crappier than other hotels. It's also quite far from the main strip. BUT it is cheap. If you are (for whatever God-awful reason) bringing children to Vegas, I guess this would fit the bill. Otherwise, if you're just looking for a bed and a cheap one, this also fits the bill. The beds, I will say, had clean sheets and were comfortable. But don't be fooled into thinking you're getting this amazing deal on a three star hotel. You're not. You're getting an average deal, on 1 star accommodations.
Room Tip: If you stay here, avoid the first floor rooms, which are the loudest.
