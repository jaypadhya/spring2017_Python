<html><head><h3>Circus Circus Manor Motor Lodge Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 17</h3></head><body><br>Great for a Vegas trip on a Budget.<p>I went to Las Vegas and stayed in the B building of the Manor lodge of Circus Circus. The actual hotel room wasn't too bad. It had a refrigerator, a table, a tv, wireless internet, and the bathroom was decent. The rates were amazing, and it allowed me to spend more money on my outings. The pool was pretty nice. There were three seperate pools which spread out the groups of people. If you are looking to eat on a budget the casino has many cheap places to eat. The casino is at the end of the strip so to get to all the new hotels it is best to take the bus. I rode the Duce bus which ran 24hours and returned to the bus stop every 15 minutes. It is $5 for a 24hour pass, which keeps it resonably cheap. I wouldn't reccomend this hotel for someone who is looking for a fancy new place, and to be in the center of the strip. I would reccomend this hotel for someone like me who needed to travel to vegas cheaply. It is much nicer than other hotels in its price range.</p><br>Not bad, but lock up your valuables.<p>It's a bit of a family tradition to stay at Circus Circus for us each time we have visited Vegas since 1994. Previously we had stayed in the Tower rooms and the RV park, but decided this time on the Manor because we had a rental car for the entire length of stay.
I have to say that the rooms are bigger than the Tower's and are quite clean and nicely decorated, they also have a Refrigerator which you don't get in the tower's, but unfortunately no Microwave or Internet connection. Having to go to the main building to check in and out is a nuisance, but once you are there at least you don't have to drag suitcases through the midway and the casino which is a big plus.
As neither my daughter or myself are gamblers, we didn't miss having to walk through a smoke filled Casino every time we left our room.
However, prospective guests beware, we did have items of newly purchased clothing go "missing" from our room, so I would recommend keeping your suitcases LOCKED and keep money and valuables with you. We contacted 'Security' who were very uninterested and advised that it was unlikely they would find the "missing" items, they issued a Report number only on my insistance, which I will need to claim on my travel insurance.
If you want fancy Pools with slides and stuff this is not for you, also if you don't have your own transport, stay further towards the middle of the strip.
This is one of the older hotels and the local rumour is that it's days are numbered, along with a few others nearby, but I think the theme is good, so hopefully they will re-build it with all the "Bells and whistles".</p><br>Nice hotel, wrong location.<p>I go to Las Vegas every year. My first experience was in October 2004 and my fianc√© and I stayed at Circus Circus. The rooms were very nice, but location wise, it was definitely the wrong choice for us. We spent much of our time walking or busing to the other end of the strip. The only time we actually were in the hotel was to sleep or eat. I will not stay at Circus Circus based only on this. It was a nice hotel, with nice staff, and nice rooms. I did however get lost a couple of times trying to get to my room. The price is right, the buffet is okay. It all depends on a persons plans while in Vegas. If this hotel was up the strip more, I would probably stay again. If you do stay here, make sure your room is not near the circus tent at all. I think this would be a fabulous hotel if we had children. Kids would have a blast in this hotel. If you are going to Vegas for the first time, do some research. Plan out what you want to do and stay close to the things you want to do and see. I wish I had.</p><br>Would not stay there again<p>I stayed at the Circus Circus Hotel, Manor Suites (which is separate from the Tower (the main building) for a show my son was a part of 4th of July weekend 2006.

First off, let me say that the manor suites are like staying at a motel. There is a totally separate facility, parking lot, buildings, pool, etc., which was extremely inconvenient considering the 115 degree weather. If you want to go eat, you have to cross the street to the main building, if your key gets lost or if they go bad, you have to cross the street, if you need anything, you have to cross the street to the main tower to see concierge, front desk support; if you want to go gambling or to eat, and the list goes on and on, again you have to cross walk across the parking, cross the street, go through the indoor parking lot then to the main tower. The rooms have just beds and a phone, no pamphlets or brochures for advice on the areas attractions, etc.

The pool area was crowded, the pool was cloudy and there was nothing fancy about it, no water fall, diving board, slide, nothing. Just hot concrete, and warm water, and even that is a treck from the manor rooms.

The service by every employee I came into contact with was average, non-helpful and sometimes rude, everyone from maid servers, amusement park personnel, front desk employers and even a manager. When I mentioned some issues to the manager she said "oh sorry", but never offered any compensation whatsoever, not even a comment card, I had to ask for one and then was pointed to where I could find it.

All in all, I would not recommend this hotel room, especially not a manor room to anyone, not to sure what the Tower (the main building) rooms had to offer.</p><br>Not the family friendly place it makes out to be<p>We decided to stay at the circus circus hotel as we have a 21mth old infant. Afterall they do advertise as a family friendly hotel. After queuing for over an hour to check in we eventually got to our rooms which didnt even have a fridge. In 40 plus heat with an infant the least you would expect in your hotel room is a fridge !. The net curtains were badly stained and the beds felt like they had no mattresses on them. We stayed here as part of a self organised tour of the west coast and nevada and I have to say it was the worst hotel we've ever stayed in. We then had to queue again (for over 40mins) to check out as the "express checkout" facility on the TV was not available. I really would not reccommend this hotel to ANYONE travelling to Las Vegas. It is badly in need of updating. There are too many other Faboulous places to stay for little or no extra.</p><br>easy parking.<p>Easy parking. Unlike most other hotels, you can easily park your car in front of the Manor buildings and walk to/reach your room within a minute. It's old, yes. But you can't beat the parking....</p><br>Clean, spacious, great for budget travellers.<p>This was my first trip to Las Vegas and after reading all the awful reviews on this hotel I was really not looking forward to my stay at Circus Circus. I stayed at the Manor Motor Lodge as it was the only one with vacancy during the NAB convention.

The room was very clean, no weird smells, no weird stains. Being able to park in front of my room in a well lit parking lot was very convenient. I would say upper-scale MOTEL quality is the best way to describe this place. The clown channel on tv was rather freakish but I've seen worse. As long as you're not expecting golden toilets and silk towels, this hotel/motel is OK.</p><br>Circus Circus---Never stay at the Manor<p>Circus Circus has a "budget" section that is not properly described. The Manor at Circus Circus is in such a state of disrepair it is unbelievable. Stains in carpet, fans in bathroom that do not work, beds with painful springs, honestly, this place was worse than a LOW budget chain. Yeah, they were cooperative, but they had to move us 3 TIMES, and apologized profusely, talk about embarrasing.
Apparently they are tearing The Manor down within the next 2 years. I've stayed at Best Western, Motel 6, Holiday Inn, La Quinta, etc. SO much better. Apparently the management has deemed it unnecessary to make repairs to certain areas, i.e., the escalators, elevator, ice machines, and so on.
We were utterly dissapointed with our stay, even though we were only in the room for an average of 4 hours per night. Next time we go for the NASCAR races, we will get the Package with a better Hotel, possibly TI. From Washington state---------Scott</p><br>One SNAFU but otherwise okay<p>I couldn't get a room at the Hilton because it and almost everywhere else had the day I was arriving as a "no arrival" day, so I was kind of desperate. Finally, I booked a Manor room at the Circus Circus through an online service for the first night and then got a reservation at the Hilton the rest of the visit. Fortunately, I printed and took with me the online service's email confirming my reservation and the fact that the room was paid for in advance and unrefundable, because when I got to the Circus Circus, they had no record of me having a reservation. They did give me a room, though, and by the time I checked out, they had figured out what was wrong and didn't charge me anything. Well, except that silly $1.00 surcharge for the phone. Why don't they just include that in the room rate?

I was pleasantly surprised by the room. It was very large and comfortable. The bed was reasonably comfortable and there was like a dinette table with chairs, too. The only frustrating thing was that the cable TV had only like 4 channels (Headline news, ESPN, TBS, and something else) besides the hotel's in house channels. Who doesn't have CBS, NBC, and ABC on their hotel TV cable???

The porters were very, very helpful.

I would stay here again if I needed to. It's not my first choice, but it did in the pinch.</p><br>8 Days @ Circus Circus<p>Our party of 8 arrived in Las Vegas on Dec. 4 for a week and took up 4 rooms in the West Tower. Our $40 room was on the 10th floor immediately above the check in counter. Apart from a bit of initial confusion over which elevator to take our stay was quite pleasant. Our room was clean and well appointed, the only disappointment was the limited view of the roof of the amusewment park. Not a big deal. The rest of our party had no complaints about their rooms. The hotel was fairly quiet in spite of the rodeo finals taking place that week and the only busy day was the Saturday. We patronized the buffet for breakfast most mornings and it was fine although like much of Vegas nowadays it's not overly cheap. I have stayed at this hotel in the past in the cheaper Manor rooms and have never had any trouble with the property of any sort. We checked out the Strato Tower one afternoon and on hearing that we were staying at CC the elevator guy said, "C'mon now, I hear the rooms there are real dumps." Sorry, partner, no such luck on the 10th floor.</p><br></body></html>
