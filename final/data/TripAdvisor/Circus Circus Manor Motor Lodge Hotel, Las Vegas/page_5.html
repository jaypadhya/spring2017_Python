<html><head><h3>Circus Circus Manor Motor Lodge Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 5</h3></head><body><br>Average/good<p>Layout of property is a little confusing. I stayed at the manor motor lodge with 3 other people for 4 nights. The quality of the room was below our expectations but you get what you paid for. I tried a few restaurants that ranged from average to good. The walk to the strip was further than expected. I would probably stay at a more expensive hotel next time that's located in the middle of the strip which would make up for the taxi fare. We ended up taking several taxi's. By the end of our trip we probably paid approx $120 in taxi fare. Adventure dome and gambling was fun and it was fun watching free circus acts.</p><br>Below average accommodation<p>This accommodation is actually motel type blocks separate from the main hotel.The first thing you will notice is an all pervading "disinfectant" type smell when you enter the block,its horrible!
The rooms themselves are a decent size,clean,comfortable enough beds.The noise inside the block is constant.There doesn`t seem to be any soundproofing and you hear everthing from the adjacent rooms and the corridors.The a/c is extremely noisy but this is ok as you can use it to drown out the other noises all around you.The rooms in the hotel towers are apparently of a higher standard and I would advise anyone staying at Circus Circus to try for one of those rooms and avoid the Manor Motor Lodge.
Room Tip: Don't stay in the Manor Motor Lodge

I had reserved two rooms, and booking had required that I book one in my husband's name. I was told he had to sign for the room. He was out waiting in the car, so I sent my daughter out...but he was no longer there because he was ordered to move on....so despite our staying in the motel, he was on the fifth floor of the parking garage. When he showed up at the counter, we went to our dingy, out-dated rooms with paper thin walls. At least I knew what my daughter and her friend were doing. The "cooler" stayed warm. The property was set back quite a bit from the strip. Walking through the casino to get to our motel turned out to be quite a hike in itself....and then we were far from the part of the strip we were interested in seeing. This place was cheap, and it felt cheap.</p><br>Manor-Motor Inn...just a bed and shower<p>Stayed in the old Manor (Motor) Inn section, 2nd floor Bldg. E...was a little hesitant because of location, but we constantly saw security on bicycles and people walking. If you're looking for luxury NOT your place, best for those who have a car. Bed and pillows very comfy, room size was good, shower tub was too narrow, lighting very dim, our view was terrible, we had our own cooler but "mini-cooler" was cold enough for our snacks, had no table to eat our late night pizza, but not an issue. You can enter the building in the middle of the inn and use elevators if needed. The casino was too far(hot) too walk so we used our car, parked at Bldg. A., The casino was too crowded and food was pricey. At Rock n Rita's food was slow in coming, but food was good. We checked in at 12am, but we saw the line at 3pm, avoid it if you can!!! Check in early(for fee) or later. Most of our visit to Vegas was off the strip, so the location was just perfect for us... we didn't plan on gambling. Bring snacks, didn't find vending machines, unless you go into the casino or convenience store. Adventuredome, circus acts, and midway were perfect for the kids. This was a great price for our needs...a bed and shower. I would stay again here only if we bring the kids and have a car.
Room Tip: Manor Inn section of Circus Circus could be an option, if you don't want to deal with crowds at...

The location was convenient, the room was clean, overall one of the better motel-type-places I've stayed at. You actually check in at the main desk inside Circus Circus, so you still get that Las Vegas feel. Yes, the line to check in can be long, but you're in Vegas, in one of the biggest tourist areas. Even though the lodge is separate from the main casino, you still have this great Vegas feel to it.

By the way, if you suffer from Coulrophobia, this may not be the area for you.
Room Tip: Travel in the off season (Late Sept to Early May)!!!
See more room tips</p><br>Good hotel for low price<p>Last minute booking to Las Vegas with rooms in the motor manor lodge of the Circus Circus casino. The hotel is slightly old fashioned, but it has the entourage of a casino in LV. Pros: The rooms are big, include airconditioning and it has a wonderfull bed. The rooms were clean, housekeeping everyday and close to the Duece (bus on the Strip). The cons: far from the crowded side of the strip and the airconditioning is loud. Conclusion: if you are looking for a good, clean hotel for a fair price: Circus Circus is what you are looking for.</p><br>Best value deal on the Strip<p>At the measly price of $25 per night we were accommodated on the Strip and got one of the best deals at the lower end of the market available. Did the online research before hand and hotels with similar cheap rates were charging twice as much for the 'resort fee', charged $25 a night for Air Con....(unbelievable!) or had similar hidden fees. It was mid June and the temp was constantly in triple figures. With a bit of pre-planning....I made the effort to bring a reasonable sized ice box and self supplied coffee machine, enough for the 3 adults and two rooms we booked so we had pretty much all the comforts of a 3-4 star hotel at one quarter the price. Have read some reviews where the comments complained about the lack of amenities....so next time do your homework and ask questions...? The place had a great pool, you got $20 for a breakfast or dinner buffet and the staff we dealt with were cool people. All round I'd recommend it to the smart traveler looking for a good deal in Vegas but the only thing I didn't have a say in was the time of year we went....wow! Coming from the Central Coast in CA , the high temps were a little too much at times and it was a godsend to have 'free' A/C in the rooms.
Room Tip: Unless you're a smoker, make sure you stipulate a non-smoking room...the people I was with,didn...
See more room tips</p><br>Be careful<p>I was recently there with parents & sister family. First check-in at hotel is inefficient, it took more than an hour for me to check in due to crowd & less checkin counters. Lots of people jump in with aggressive approach & no control management at check in line as well as check out line. Rooms carpets stinks, very basic infrastructure, no proper security, got few dents & scratches on car at parking, never came to know. Good things, they gave $20 food voucher but charged resort fee tax of US$9 per day per room, it was not known during booking. Parking free but take care where you park your vehicle as anything can happen in vegas Room are noisy as you can hear the neighbour noise & crazy sounds. It is good low price but not worth of experience. Manor Lodge give me impression of lost image of Circus Cirus which I enjoyed in 2003.But it is vegas so it stayed there only.
Room Tip: Look around
See more room tips</p><br>Cheap!!!!<p>We had to nights in may here, vey reasonable cost but the Manor part of the complex is very tired and worn out, realy noisy air con unit, it was clean and clean and comfortable and if your on a buget then you don't really mind, for few Dollars more you van do better on the same resort, it's at the far end of the strip so it a fair walk to the other big Casinos, but you can catch the buss that stop right outside. we used the buffet for breakfast and dinner and were good value with lots a choice for all the family, there were loads of children enjoying themselves, the pool area was great with life guards on duty. drinks at the bars were expensive as well.</p><br>Cheap, but at a cost<p>To start with the good thing, beds were nice and clean, but everything else is old and in dying need of a renovation.
Walls are paperthin, you can hear anything the neighbours say or worse, do.
Carpets are stained, curtains are damaged and have holes in them,the place is more or less a dump,imho.
Don't do it, there are better places for only a few dollars more.</p><br></body></html>
