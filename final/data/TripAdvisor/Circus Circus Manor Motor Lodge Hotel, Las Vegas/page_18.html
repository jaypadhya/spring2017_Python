This was a busy place when you first check-in but it was worth it!! The buffet was excellent, the kids have the indoor roller coasters and the circus shows, the adults have the casinos..OVERALL an EXCELLENT
HOTEL with many extras.. We booked the internet rate and felt it was More than a bargain for the price we paid.</p><br>Vegas 2005<p>I had the pleasure of visiting Las Vegas again this year, but this time, I stayed at Circus Circus. I stayed in one of the Manor Rooms, which was quite a distance from the main casino (my mother was not pleased, she has trouble walking long distances). Since it was late when I checked in, I had to wait until the next morning. I went to the front desk and asked if there was another room available in one of the Towers. The only room they had was a smoking room (we don't smoke), but you couldn't tell that it was a smoking room. Once we moved into our new room the stay was very very enjoyable. I even strolled the Midway, I felt like a kid again. Even though it was a long way from the newer hotel casinos, the trolley was available. We also visited The Orleans, my mother and my sister said they had come home to roost. Circus Circus is a great place, especially if you have children. I would stay there again. I plan to visit Vegas annually.</p><br>Vegas is a rip<p>My hubby & I just returned from a convention in Las Vegas staying at Circus Circus. Our room was on the 14th floor of the skytower. It was neat and clean, had fresh towels each day, and quiet. We were pleased with our room and service. The only thing I didn't like was the fact we had no coffee maker in our room. Had to go downstairs from the 14th floor to the Krispy Kreme shop each morning. Took about 20-30 minutes to get down and back. But Las Vegas in general is another story. What a rip. Talk about expensive. This town used to be reasonable. Not any more. Hardly any free drinks. They cut down on the cocktail waitresses coming around the slot machines, takes about an hour till they come around again, because they want you to go up to the bars and buy your drinks. No cash coming out the machines, you get vouchers to cash in. No more using the coins that come out the machines, they want you to keep digging in your wallet. No coffee makers in rooms like I previously mentioned. We sat down at the bar at New York New York for a drink and the barmaid said we won't get free drinks until we put $10 in the machines at the bar. We drank our $8 mix drinks and left. The coaster atop New York New York is $12.50 to ride one time, $25.00 for all day. It's hard to find a bus at night. Sat for almost 1 hour one evening when it was cold and windy. The Blue Iguana restaurant inside Circus Circus is closed 2 nights a week due to cutting labor. C'mon it's Vegas. Restaurants shouldn't close. It's not that there isn't enough of customers. Even Hoover Dam now charges. Five bucks to park and $10 for the boring tour. I've seen all of Hoover Dam I'm gonna see. We had a great time but it's way too expensive for my wallet. Vegas has seen the last of me for a very long time.</p><br>What a dump<p>We stayed in 3 hotels over Xmas and this one was the worst!!! Would not stay there again, way better across the street to the Riveria. I called them from the tourist office in Prim, paid $80 and got this crap hole. Stay away at all cost!!!!!!</p><br>It Sucks<p>We booked two rooms with Circus Circus recently. We were charged $90/- per room and we were given Manor Motor Lodge building E.

Both rooms were poorly maintained, dusty and the bed spreads had stains in them. I had never seen anything as dirty as these rooms. When I walked back to the reception (and this was late in the night), the receptionist said you get what you paid for. The manager was as rude.
I will never stay with them again. You can't get anything worse.</p><br>YUCK!<p>This place was such a horrible dump. It smelled old, smoky and like urine, there were very questionable people there and when we were trying to check in we had to park on a high level and walk down through grafitti ridden staircases because the elevator did not work. I wouldn't let my family sit on anything and we demanded our prepaid 1st night back as we refused to stay even one minute in such a ****heap of a motel. I am not even mentioning the surly women in the parking area. We had just stayed in a wonderful hotel in Anaheim, this was a real shock. Don't stay here!</p><br>Not as bad as made out to be by previous reviewers!!!!<p>We just got back from Las Vegas today!!! The manor rooms were certainly more than adequate.They were older but very clean.The manor rooms have parking right outside which was very convenient.There is a small dorm size frig which is great for keeping milk or sodas in or formula if you have a baby.The room was very inexpensive,low $40's for 2 adults,2 kids.If you don't like or have children then Circus Circus isn't the place for you.Another hotel would probably better meet your needs.The circus acts are a bit short,but my 10 yo daughter liked them.The Adventure Dome was fun and an ok deal using the coupon book provided @ check in.It was about $36 for my daughter and I to get the unlimited rides pass.I am 40 yo but even I had a good time laughing w/my daughter.The pool was crowded but in 100+ weather what pool wouldn't be crowded?We didn't eat in any of the hotel except for in the Adventure Dome and then only snacks.Overall,Circuc Circus is an enjoyable place to go if you're going on a FAMILY vacation.</p><br>DUMP!<p>Circus Circus is a dump! The walls are paper thin. Even though we were in a non-smoking room, we could smell smoke. The cleaning staff was noisy. Way too many kids! If you want to take your kids on vacation, go to Disney World! I'll never stay here again.</p><br>Better than expected, Fun<p>We were pleased with Circus Circus and the manor room was better than we expected. Room was clean, not too large but decent. The property is certainly older but well presented and the rate was a bargain. Noise isolation from room to room seemed very good. It was a plus to be able to park so close to the room as well. The kids enjoyed the midway acts and games, not bad if you be sure to use the Fun Books. The Adventure Dome and rides looked great although we did not wind up using it. The Westside Deli offers jumbo hotdogs, huge Donuts and a massive Stawberry Shortcake for just $1.50 each.

The north strip location is a bit remote, better if you have a car here.

Our only gripes were the much too plump pillows, bring your own and the pool closing at 6:00 PM. Absurd to throw out the guests from the pool when still blazing hot.

All in all, we feel we did well at Circus Circus.</p><br>Good value espcially if you're driving your car<p>My boyfriend and I stayed here in the summer or 2002 (I know. I'm late with this review.) It was a great Vegas room. The room was large, quiet and clean. Because of the Motor Lodge set-up, we easily parked in front of our entrance. We didn't have to deal with walking through the casino or the large hotel to get to the room--it was only seconds from the car to the room. It's also easy to drive to from the strip. Because it's Vegas, we weren't in our room much at all. This was the perfect place to crash. I've stayed at the MGM Grand before and liked the CC Motor Lodge much better. It's more practical if you're out and about exploring Sin City.</p><br></body></html>
