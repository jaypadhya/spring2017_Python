<html><head><h3>Circus Circus Manor Motor Lodge Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 9</h3></head><body><br>read the fine print<p>I went on hotels.com to get a room in Vegas, I came across the circus circus, the had great rates, so I booked a room with them. When I printed the receipt I noticed that it said in the manor motor lodge, I did a double take to make sure I booked with circus circus, like I thought I did. Sure enough, I did. The manor motor lodge is across the street from circus circus, it is not in the hotel towers, so to walk from the far end of the manor motor lodge to the casino area.....was quite a walk, there is a sky walk that takes you across, but there is still alot of walking. Also, they charge you for early check in.....I guest most places do, but just beware. The motel it self was not too bad, some renovations are needed, and the hallways smelled funny, But the bed was comfortable and the water pressure was pretty good.</p><br>Stay Away From Manor Motor Lodge Low Cost Rooms<p>Circus Circus is one of Las Vegas Land Marks Known for its looks as a Circus. Also Popular among other hotel chains due to easy access for kids atertainment. But you would believe that this location is a good place to stay at a great budget. YES it is if you are on a budget. Don't take me wrong, If you are planning to stay here think twice before choosing the LOW cost rooms that are located more than a Mile away from the hotel entrance. I believe at this level of service, what Circus Circus should do for those guest is to provide a special open air Tram or shuttle service for people with disabilities or families with small children. Especially in the summer season where the heat is at over 100 degrees. If there is someone that represents CIrcus Circus, would love for you to consider this service that would help your guest have a more confortable stay. Thank you.</p><br>Big, clean, and recently remodeled.<p>We had a voucher for two free nights in Vegas and this is what the travel agent gave us. We didn't know until we checked in that we'd be in the Manor but actually were quite happy since we don't gamble and didn't need to be in the main hotel. The room was quite large and well kept. The mini-bar has been emptied out and converted to a cooler (note: not a refrigerator) which worked well to keep our water bottles cool.

Parking at the Manor is right outside the building, much closer than the parking structure is from the main building.

The only problem we had was on checking in. We arrived around 2:15 AM on a Saturday morning and waited in line for almost 2 1/2 hours to get checked in. The front desk staff was very gracious considering how over-worked they were that night. I understand that Friday nights are the busiest check-in time in Vegas but we didn't expect such a line in the wee hours of Saturday morning.</p><br>Cheap but clean<p>The Manor lodge is across the road from the main hotels two main towers. Only a 3 minuite walk from the reception which is based at the back of the hotel anyway. Theres 5 rows of 3 storey blocks. We didn't mind being out of the way from the main part of the hotel but it is a bit of a walk from your room through to the front of the main hotel and theres either a road to cross or you can get there via a walkway over the road which has stairs, lifts and escalators. The rooms in the Manor are quite old but it was clean and comfortable and the rooms are nice and big. Buy a polystyrene box from the shop at the hotel ( $4 ) and fill it from the free ice machines around the hotel to keep your drinks cold. Theres 2 pools next to the Manor lodges too which was great. Theres lots of kids at this Hotel because of the theme park at the hotel.
Room Tip: This is a family hotel so expact lots of kids where ever you are. Because Vegas never sleeps expect...

The rooms are pretty standard hotel rooms, but the access was fantastic! No need to tromp through the god awful mega lobby, deal with the maze of mall-ish/hellish casion mess, or even navigate any elevators. Just pull up to the building and head in motel style. The exterior has a pretty cool retro look, though the interiors are standard hotel (better than standard motel). It's near the pools, which we didn't use. They do give you a coupon book including some free rides at the indoor amusement park, which we used and then skedaddled. The very big downside is that you have to deal with the main Circus Circus hotel to check in or out or find a restaurant. I had to wait in line with about a 100 people to check in. There plainly is a building that was the old lobby of the motel. If they would reopen that, allow check-in there, and supply maybe a coffee, pasty counter there. Voila'! Would be a thousand times better. Beware that there are a lot of drunken young people partying at all hours. The hallways are loud with lots of activity between rooms at all hours, security was involved a few times.</p><br>Whatta Disappointment!!!!!<p>Please do your research prior to booking Circus Circus Las Vegas. As a senior, I wish I would
have known there were two locations for lodging. We checked into the "Tower" building only to
be told we had to walk (pulling our luggage) to the 'Manor Motor Lodge' which was behind the
'Tower' bldg. A 'no smoking' room was requested, but once we got to our room, it reeked of
cigarette smoke. The room phone did not work; called the 'desk' requesting a new location on
my cell phone; accepted delivery of a new key; then had to drag our luggage back to whence
we first checked in. With COPD and extremely hot weather, I was gasping for breath upon
arriving back at the 'Tower'. Check-in was 2 hrs. +. Strike one... At last,our smokeless room
was available, was comfortable - no problems. Hotel staff was unfriendly and uninformative;
so I relied on hotel guests for info on transp., restaurants, etc. Had a great time once away
from the hotel. Strike two: no refrigerator for my meds. Strike three: no security lock on the
door. Strike four: ice machine broke down at both sides on the 6th floor. Strike five: had to
pay for iterniary printout ($6 bucks). Upon leaving hotel, had to request a receipt -- strike six...
Perhaps Circus Circus was not the hotel I should have checked into. Better luck next time.....
Room Tip: Make sure of the building you'll reside in once you've booked reservations.

It's your basic average no frills rooms, but clean and comfortable and a great value. These rooms are close to the pool area. A little walk to the main casino, but not to far. Parking is limited around the manor area , but additional parking is available across the street at the main casino. We would definitely stay here again.</p><br>Ugh!<p>Stayed at the Motor Lodge in April - the room as well as the hallways of the place have a depressed, neglected look. This could have been easily corrected by a fresh coat of paint, new carpeting and new doors to some of the rooms (our door was dented and dirty) - a minor amount of work, considering the hotel's size and reputation. The buffet was only ok (although it is obscene that such amounts of food are wasted on a daily basis!) and the amusement park is nice for the kids. Would have given the place a higher rating if not for the room</p><br>Clean, Comfortable and Good<p>I booked this online for my first visit to vegas, the lodge is right at the back of the Circus Circus complex and quite a walk, but it's good value if you avoid the weekends, the price rises steeply at the weekend which I didn't know or I would have gone midweek.
Room Tip: Cheap if you choose your days, clean and comfortable
