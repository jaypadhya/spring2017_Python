<html><head><h3>Circus Circus Manor Motor Lodge Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 11</h3></head><body><br>Value Room?<p>We booked at the Circus Circus because rooms were only $30 a night and I had been there as a kid and remembered it being a convenient and fun place. Going back 10 years later as an adult it was quite far away from the rest of the casinos and it was extremely crowded and the room was on the verge of shabby. Maybe I should have guessed it from the price, but I was disappointed! However the room was clean and if you are looking for a cheap place to stay Cricus Circus could definitely it. For me, the overcrowding (extremely long check-in and check out lines) and the dark room which had seen better days made it not worth it.</p><br>A horrible experience!<p>This motel was a last resort after losing our flight in Las Vegas and with a limited budget we had not too many choices left to choose from. The funny thing is that with the same price we paid for that room, we could have stayed in a 5-star hotel suite in Vegas!
Although we checked in at the main hotel Circus Circus we had to drive with our car all the way at the back to another set of buildings where Manor is. The parking was the only thing positive about that place! It was free and there were plenty of parking lots available and you could park right outside your room if possible.
The building was under renovation and everything in it seemed forgotten, dirty and old. The room itself was utterly disgusting! It had two double beds for the 3 of us, a tv, a bathroom and toilet. Even the hairdryer was not working and we had to ask for another one while the windows seemed unsafe. As for the motel amenities, one should go walk or drive to the main hotel's restaurants.
If it wasn't for one night we definitely wouldn't handle this place! It was a horrible experience especially after having stayed at Treasure and MGM hotels which offered top quality services and comfort. We do not recommend this motel to anyone planning to visit Las Vegas even if you are looking for a budget hotel!
Room Tip: Do not even think about staying there!! And if you are planning to book your stay with Circus Circus...

My husband opened the safe and huge cockroaches greeted him. One was about to lay eggs so soon that room will be infested with the disgusting things. Circus circus promptly moved us to another tower when we called them. I understand that things sometimes happen but I didn't detect shock or anything when we complained. They KNOW the motel is in horrible conditions and rely on foreigners or people who are just desperate for te "Vegas" experience and are willing to stay in those conditions. If I can't stay in the west tower (which are actually very nice) I wont be staying at this hotel again.</p><br>Pay More and go to another Hotel<p>We went to Circus Circus for a family trip. I did not know that the Circus Circus Manor was NOT connected to the hotel. So every time you want to go to the Midway or to eat you had to walk to the hotel! Not only was it an inconvenience but it was not the cleanest place to stay either, we had holes in our sheets and dirty towels. The only good thing I can say is that it was close to the pool, the kids did like the Midway, and the Circus Acts (once you walked there). If we plan another Las Vegas family trip I would spend the extra money and go to Excalibur or New York New York.</p><br>Undergoing Updates July 2011<p>We chose this hotel even tho it was undergoing rehab -it offers better parking if you are towing a boat home from Mead or Powell and want to stop off in Vegas. We could park our boat right outside our window so we could keep an eye on it and all of our gear instead of struggling thru parking garages. The walk to the main casino isn't bad either. A bit noisy, but it IS Vegas. We got the room for $25/night--pretty good deal.</p><br>Good for a cheap room in Vegas<p>The Circus Circus Manor Motor Lodge is a good place for families and those just needing a place to crash in Las Vegas. we reserved the room during the Circus Circus half-price sale and the rooms were all of $30. The bed was comfy, the wi-fi worked well and the room was clean and tidy. They are renovating the rooms and that is nice. The major drawback the keeps this from earning a 4 (Very Good) rating, there are no coffee pots in the rooms!!! The Motor Lodge is behind the main building and quite a ways to the strip, wear your walking shoes.
Room Tip: Bring an iced coffee or be ready to walk a long way

No matter what you asked for they didn't have it, (room coffee, extra anything) and it was way out in the back forty at the end of the strip where it gets a bit creepy if you know what I mean.
The walls are paper thin and you can hear EVERY sound from the other rooms. The people next door drank and fought all night and nobody would do much about it as it's such a big place and the Manor is the least of their worries.
I would sleep in the car before staying here again. Seriously.</p><br>It was horrible!<p>Never again! I went through AARP to book a hotal in Vegas.....oh my goodness, we were sent to the back of this hotel,in a place called the Manor. It was dirty, outlets did not work, hair dryer did not work and wall paper was peeling at edges. I hate writing bad reviews, but this place was horrible. It was a three star rating and it should have been a one star.
Sorry, but don't want anyone to walk into this place with out knowing.</p><br>we had so much fun and we'll be back!<p>I read some of the reviews and was worried, but we stayed in the manor rooms they were clean. The check was quick and everyone that worked there was helpful and friendly!</p><br>The biggest dump in Vegas (roaches and filth inside)<p>I find it hard to believe there are worse places than this in vegas.
The room was really cheap, but everywhere is cheap in vegas midweek, and you can certainly do better for the same price, and even if you cant spend the extra $5 to stay elsewhere I promise you will not regret it.
A few highlights of my stay:
-Roaches inside the room and all over outside the entrance.
-Toilet was leaking after calling twice with a flooded bathroom, be just gave up and dealt with puddles all over.
-No mini fridge or microwave in room
-No coffeemaker in room. ( I am sipping on a $4 cappucino I purchased from the casino coffee stand)
-Casino is an absolute dump
-Terrible pool
-Filthy inside and out also filthy casino
-No remote control in room and manual channel change didnt work either so all we could watch was the vegas channel
-Check in was a 45 minute wait
-Hookers all over the place. (probably due to lack of security and they know this is the one place that will put up with them)
-Free internet worked fine and that was actually a nice feature</p><br></body></html>
