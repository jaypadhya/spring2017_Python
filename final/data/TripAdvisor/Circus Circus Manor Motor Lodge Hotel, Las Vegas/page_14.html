<html><head><h3>Circus Circus Manor Motor Lodge Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 14</h3></head><body><br>The worst hotel I have ever stayed in... beware of the clowns.<p>I came here because my sister was getting eloped by Elvis. We paid the same exact amount for the tower rooms and we were in the KOA section. The room smelt bad... the door was broken... the carpets were dirty... the doors couldn't lock securely.... cold showers.... TV hummed.... springs in your back.... no control of AC....not close to anything....no sound barriers.....young children running around at all hours of the night (poor parenting).....1/2 mile from the actual hotel.... Room 2226 building C. If you can stay in the towers I would suggest it, my sisters room was considerably nicer and I would have never of complained.</p><br>Yikes<p>The quintessential Las Vegas Motor Lodge, minus the "Hole Year Inn" sign and friendly manager. The room smellled, the mattresses were lumpy and cheap, the carpet was stained black in places and there was mildew in the bathroom.....but we had a great time. However, if I had planned a sober vacation - I would have complained about this room post haste.</p><br>Bring your Bed with you.<p>This is the first I stayed at the Manor. I have stayed at the Hotel Before. But the Manor is some thing else. The Manor must be the after thought place. Where they put things that a through out of Hotel. The Bed, the worse thing I ever sleep on. The coils where in my back all night long. Stayed there 3 nights. Three night of living hell. The table and chairs in room where way to high. Felt like I was stting in a high chair. (Child) The exhaust fan didn't work in the bathroom.</p><br>Great bargain<p>The room was nice an clean and right on the money. On the end of the strip, but still a good place to start your sightseeing.</p><br>Terrible hotel very poor customer service<p>Me and my girlfriend stayed at this hotel for a 1 night stop over, we found checking in was a nightmare, staff were very rude, they put us in the manor rooms which I would describe as a motel based across the road from the hotel, the rooms were very clean, the only positve thing I can put. The hotel is based for families but could do with an extreme make over. If you are looking at this hotel because of the cheap value, I would recomend paying a bit more and staying at the MGM,</p><br>It's a Circus Circus all right...in all the wrong ways!<p>I booked at Circus Circus because of the price and the fact that the Manor rooms included a refrigerator for no extra charge. The absence of a "resort fee" was nice as well. This place served its purpose as a place to sleep, store our luggage & rest when not out on the Strip. The down side is that the beds are not all that comfortable and the TV service is minimal, so don't expect to watch more than news or TBS. There are movies (adult & otherwise, I believe), but I didn't watch any of that, so I'm not sure what they cost.

Another problem was that I requested a non-smoking room and I believe that my room, while not designated either way, was originally a smoking room, since it had a distinct smoke smell to it. It was an immediate turnoff, but as there was no ashtray, I can't say if the smoking was done on the sly or if the room was designated as "non-smoking" and then not properly cleaned. It wasn't enough of a problem to complain about. When I arrived, there was no refrigerator in the room (despite "all" manor rooms having them according to advertisement). My husband called the front desk and one was sent over fairly quickly, so no problems there. They did have to pull it out of another room, though, so I have a feeling that they are short on fridges.

The actual casino and surrounding property, including the main tower, restaurants and the like, is VERY crowded at all times of the day and night. You are forced to walk through a mall-like shopping area on the way to the manor rooms or walk through reception and around the property. The salespeople are very pushy and frequently try to ask you questions or sell you stuff, even when you are dragging luggage and obviously checking out of the hotel. This creates a traffic jam and a lot of delays when trying to move through the hotel.

The circus acts are cute, but the bleacher style seating area is cramped and made of hard plastic. It doesn't make you feel very comfortable. the area is small, so most times when you are interested in watching the show, there is no place to sit anyway.

I feel that this place might be a good place for parents with kids due to the Adventuredome area and to a lesser degree, the midway and the circus acts, but for childless people in their 30s, this place was too tacky and hectic for our taste. Once in the room it was okay, but there are other places to stay for a similiar price that wouldn't be a zoo. If price is a concern, try downtown or a property off the strip. The bus service is fairly good in Las Vegas and some, like the Orleans, have shuttles. I definitely won't be back and honestly, I think this Circus is on its last legs. To think the owners are the same as the Mandalay Bay is a bit shocking!</p><br>Great value<p>We were pleasantly surprised with the Manor Motor Lodge. It's a huge room, clean, bath room is great, slightly noisy between rooms. But a great value at $30/night! We weren't here to gamble, just passing through and needed a place for the night.</p><br>It's a horrible place, worst than motels!<p>The rooms were not clean and the sheets felt dirty. The beds were horrible, you can feel the springs in the bed. They would put padding on one bed and not the other. When you complain, they switch you to other rooms in the area, but all the Manor rooms had horrible beds. It's worst than sleeping on the floor. When we asked for a room upgrade, they told us everything is completely booked out. After switching to like 5 different rooms, we finally got settled with a full refund and booked at another hotel. Don't ever stay here!</p><br>Good family fun<p>My wife and I stayed here on the 4th July w/e. Temp reached 42c so the a/c and swimming pools were great. Not in a central part of 'The Strip' but the bus out the front of the casino was great for getting around (a/c'd too!). The rooms were dated, walls between rooms are paper thin (could here conversations from next room) - but comfortable and clean. WiFi was available but at a cost and a bit pricey.
Great restaurant choices within the casino. A good choice to stay if you are a family with children. Regular circus acts, a huge double story indoor amusement centre (rides, clowns, etc)
Probably wouldn't stay here again but definately a good choice for the budget concious and young family.</p><br>The worst<p>Not a pleasant experience, because of:
- Very dirty carpet,
- Cushion on one of only two chairs provided (in a room for 4 people) was wet and one of the three lamps wasn't working,
- It took over an hour for someone from housekeeping to bring a light bulb and to exchange the disgusting chair with another that was not wet, but quite stained.
- We chose the manor room over the main hotel room because it offers a fridge. However, the fridge is small and noisy.
- Personal safety concerns:
1. The main entrance door was propped open with a towel as the security lock didn't work. When somebody removed the towel (either unknowingly or because of security concerns) it meant that guests couldn't get back to their rooms.
2. We had drunk people sleep right outside our room lying in the hallway. There was no security provided.
We would not stay again no matter how good the deal.</p><br></body></html>
