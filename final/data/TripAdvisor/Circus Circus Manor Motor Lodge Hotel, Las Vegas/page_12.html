<html><head><h3>Circus Circus Manor Motor Lodge Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 12</h3></head><body><br>ok for one night, just.<p>the service was ok, 15mins to check in.
the room was basic, worn , smelt stale and in need of a refurb. However, the shower worked, the bed was comfy, the tv worked but the walls were thin and it was noisy, but it is las vegas. Only there one night so it was bearable but i could not go back. would rather pay more and stay out of town. Iam not fan of vegas or what it stands for, although i appreciate people have to experience the place as it is unique.
location was good enough. struggling to say anything good about cc.
Room Tip: near bus stop, near to i15 state highway.
See more room tips</p><br>Dirty<p>We checked in and the non smoking room was smelling smoky. I would say the bathroom hasn't been housekeeped if weren't for the folded towels. The sink was dirty and so was the tub with such things as hair. Under the bed there were beer cans and as the 4 nights spent there went by and the cans continued there, I wondered how many anniversaries they had celebrated. There were also lot of dustballs in the room's corners, my pen fell under the bed and I decided to give up on it because the carpet was disgusting. We made reservations through a travel website and were not aware of the "resort fee" of aprox US$7/day. That made us even more disapointed. Awful hotel. I´ve been to Vegas 3 times before, stayed at MGM, Excalibur and Luxor and would stay at Circus Circus again.</p><br>poor deal<p>The room was not well cleaned and the maids didn't replace the towels (took them though, so progressively less every day). No soap when we arrived.
Very basic (and none too clean) room, quiet but not convenient to the strip nor even the circus circus casino really.
Some of the electrical outlets didn't work.
No privacy door hang tag.
No privacy curtain, so getting dressed you need to run all the lamps to get enough light.
I normally don't mind basic accommodations, but the niceties of towels and soap kind of sink this one for me. There are better places a block off the strip at this price.</p><br>SMELLS LIKE A PUB!<p>I made reservations trough a Las Vegas Website. I was happy because we could stay at the Circus Circus hotel for a good price. we like the fact of staying there because all the attractions for the Kids (THE CIRCUS, THE GAMES, AND THE FUN STUFF). But oh!!! surprise the manor area is separated from the resort. it took us forever to make it to our room. you have to walk about .06 miles to get to the "E" building on the manor area. The first thing we noticed when entering the "E" building was a Smoke odor. even when we asked for a non-smoking room the smell was really awful. There were stains everywhere on the ceiling on the walls and in the rooms they have old TV'S 1 soap and 1 shampoo a day. I would never recomend anyone to stay there. I hate the fact that people in the hotel are not servicial and you have to find out everything by yourself because they get mad even if you ask them for a restroom.</p><br>The worst<p>Stayed here because our flight got bumped to 6 am the following day, and we figured to stay someplace cheap for the 4 hours before we went to the airport. This was by far the most disgusting hotel I ever stayed. There were stains everywhere, it was not even connected to the hotel. When someone flushed the toilet in another room it sounded like a waterfall was in our room. At like 3 AM when woken up by something, we just gave up, walked the strip for an hour or two and went to the hotel. I have nightmares just thinking of this place and write this to not make the same mistake. With so many deals in Vegas there is no reason to ever stay at this place. If they offered to pay me to stay at this place I wouldn't do it. Save yourself and your family and go elsewhere. No joke it's the worst place I EVER stayed at, not just in Vegas, but anywhere.</p><br>Great family getaway. Can't beat the value<p>One of our most anticipated family yearly outings is staying at the Circus Circus.
We treat our 8 grandchilden to a 3 day weekend of affordable fun . If you are to expect
luxurious accommodations with an adult environment it seems logical to me that this is not the place for you. Just the hotel name it's self is evident of that....</p><br>Not bad at all.<p>The hotel might need a renovation. I have heard that it should be demolished in the
near future. I stayed there for four nights and it´s was very queit. The buffet was very nice
and cheap. The location was not so good.</p><br>Cheezy/Sleezy<p>Never again. Stayed there in the past when it was newer. The entire property needs a revamp. Room need to be gutted and redone. Clogged plumbing.. Surprised how bad it got. The parking garage out back is dangerous. Shady characters. For almost the same price stay at Stratosphere. A little isolated but better overall.</p><br>very nice stay at the Circus Circus Manor Lodge<p>We found our stay at the Circus Circus Manor just fine!.We spent 5 days here. I have just read the unfavorable review written by someone with a drunk outside their door and was surprised. We were in manor "B". The outside door was always locked and you needed your key card to enter.Our room was very clean. Our maids were very polite. Housekeeping actually helped us carry our luggage to our room.
At check, in the reception was exceptional.Very kind and patient with our questions. Directions given accurately and concisely.
We had a wonderful stay here and would recommend this hotel. It is far from the center of the strip,though.</p><br>This was our crew hotel!<p>We stayed here for about a year as an airline crew. Sad indeed, but the 6th floor where they put the crews was manageable. The rooms up there were clean and quiet and there was a a room with free computers and internet access. The trouble was, in order to get in and out of the hotel, you had to go through the casino and it's clientel. I hated seeing people who obiviously were of little means with their babies crying while they played the slot machines at 2 am in the morning, hoping to recoup their losses. In general, I don't bid these LAS trips. They go very junior in the bid process. We have since changed hotels. On the positive side....the dome with the rides, especially the rollar coaster was a lot of fun and a great bargain for families with kids who need a place to park them while they visit the casinos. Sorry, just don't like Vegas in general. I can't really recommend this hotel or any other in the city. It all seems a little seedy, even the 5 star properties.</p><br></body></html>
