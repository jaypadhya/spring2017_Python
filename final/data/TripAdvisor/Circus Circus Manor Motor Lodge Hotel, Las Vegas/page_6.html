Don't fall for it. Circus Circus itself is on the very edge of the strip at best. Abandoned casino structures stand between it and the rest of the strip. If you plan on walking along the strip don't stay here. To add insult to that, the manor lodge isn't even attached to the Circus Circus Casino. Its such a long walk you get to take a moving walkway. The benefits to staying here is one can park their car nearby. The problems lie with the fact that you are away from the strip in a back lot, where who knows what can happen. Also, the building we were in stunk like really bad air freshener. I know the budget traveler will be attracted to stay here, but you might as well stay downtown instead. Stay away from the manor, if you really want to stay at Circus Circus, at least go for the tower. Don';t stay here.
Room Tip: Stay in the towers at the very least.

We thought we would be in one of the casino towers which have been recently refurbished but got the Manor Motor Lodge rooms instead which are over the road.
Room was clean but very outdated in decor and needed upgrading, furniture was scuffed and wardrobe door hinge was hanging off. Room safe did not work and window would not open. Big Fridge if we had needed it!
Shower made a hell of a noise and was lukewarm. Air con was noisy too. Walls are paper thin, We had a very loud american next door at 3am talking on his phone and could hear every word for a hour, and people up and down the corridor opening and closing doors all night too!!
But as I said it was cheap and having 3 weeks in the states we had to budget in places and this was one of those places. I assume that they get their money with people gambling in the casino rather than the hotel rooms.
BUT when we checked in we discovered breakfast was included and that we could not fault in any way. Barista coffee is the place to go for this, good quick service and choice of 3 items plus coffee and fruit.
Good location on the strip, the Deuce bus stops right outside and goes all the way from Mandalay bay to Downtown and is reasonable on price and even better it;s AIR CONDITIONED!!
For those using this as a base to get married, the licence bureau is not too far away by car (you can park over the road) and also many wedding chapels, (we would recommend Graceland Wedding Chapel which we used),
All in all we had a good stay in Vegas and would return but probably look for a pricier hotel option next time.
Room Tip: Don't stay in the Manor Lodge until it's been upgraded, the rooms in the Casino towers look...

That part of the hotel is not in the main building. I had to exit out the west side entrance, walk across the street to a set of smaller buildings for my room. This is kind of an inconvenience but a minor one I suppose. The room is just fine, the maid service is good. There's an air conditioner here, but no safe. Most hotel rooms would have a safe. And the fridge door won't close and the fridge won't work. On the plus side, they offer complimentary wifi, and they gave me a bunch of coupons, like $20 off the dinner buffet, which is nice. Overall, it's an okay place considering the price but next time, I'll choose something more central to the Las Vegas strip.</p><br>A steal at the price.<p>Big room with a safe and a fridge. The room was clean the towels and linens clean and of good quality. The beds are comfortable. The problem is that the walls are paper thin and it is a battle to get a decent night's sleep without a sound machine. This is Vegas and people in adjacent rooms come in at all hours of the night and early morning - so forget sleeping well. Otherwise it is great - where can you stay for under $30 per night? Parking right outside your building is a bonus in Vegas.</p><br>Beware of bed bugs!!!<p>Except from the fact that I have +25 bed bug bites everything was OK. If you don't mind the itching and allergic reactions it is a nice place to stay. Free local tv, nice rooms, close to the strip, quiet location</p><br>Motor Manor Lodge Section<p>Please avoid this section, if you're looking for a room just to spend the night I guess it's ok, this section it's behind on the tower, rooms look really old, no fridge, AC noisy, old furniture, didn't park my car in that section of the hotel</p><br>Great Lodge<p>We were pleasantly surprised at how clean and nice this lodge is considering that Circus Circus has been around a long time The room was spacious, smelled nice and was very comfortable. We were close to the main casino and could ride the bus all the way down the strip or to downtowm. Access to everything was close. Our room was cleaned and had fresh towels every day. We didn't mind the walk to the main building. And the food in the restaurants at Circus Circus was superb. Our time there was fun. If someone wants more than a clean room and quiet place to sleep then maybe they should look at paying a lot more money. This was excellent for the price.
Room Tip: We were in the middle and there really was very little noise.
See more room tips</p><br>circus circus motor lodge<p>this part of the hotel is across the capark away from the main hotel. This was ok as it was closer to the pool, but after a long day it adds another 10 minute walk to any journey. The room itself was fine, we didnt spend that much time as we were doing other stuff. The room was clean but the fridge and ironing board were not great. The main issue we found here was that the doors didn't seem very secure. Everyday on returning to the room the doors was open/unlocked. I am not sure if this was the cleaners not shutting the door hard enough. I did report this to the housekeeping manager & security who took a statement but no resolution or explaination was given. On check in we were given coupons for continental breakfast (coffee/juice/pastry/fruit) and also restaurant coupons. Overall we enjoyed our stay in Las Vegas at Circus Circus but the hotel could benefit from a lounge area for parents to sit with children and perhaps watch tv. We found as a family that we had to go back to the room quite early after our evening meal as there wasn't much else to do fo the kids-obvioulsy we spent time in the adventure dome and midway/circus.</p><br>motor manor lodge<p>i do not understand what people complain about the room was clean and had what was needed we had a brilliant time there everyone was so pleasant and helpful this place was fantastic and we would definately stay there again we did not find any faults at all</p><br>smells<p>what ever you do do not stay here. it was loud at night the hallway smelled carpet was dirty. it was cheap but thats what you get cheap smelly room. spend a little more money and get a nice room. garbage and cigarette butt,all over the stairways. Refrigerator did not work door was broken heater didn't work well very loud</p><br></body></html>
