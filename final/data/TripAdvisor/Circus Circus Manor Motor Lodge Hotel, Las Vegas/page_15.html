<html><head><h3>Circus Circus Manor Motor Lodge Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 15</h3></head><body><br>Motel 6 without the amenities<p>We stayed here with family, ages 19-77. I needed a place where we could be separate from the casinos, but close to the fun so my 77-yr-old mother would not have to walk too much to enjoy the trip. First, we asked for a room on ground floor and were told they couldn't do that, but would put us close to the elevators. They put us right by the stairs but farthest away from the elevators. We had 3 rooms. Two were nice enough and clean. One smelled like something died under the bed. My sister sprayed air freshener every time we opened the door--and the smell never lessened. The beds were hard; you could feel the springs in the mattress. I didn't even know they had springs in mattresses any more. The pillows were flat. Otherwise, everything was nice enough. I didn't notice any stains or dirt or mold. The showers were nice enough.

I was most frustrated with the coffee situation. I didn't realize how frustrating it is to have to walk ten miles to get a cup of coffee. At least in Motel 6, you can walk to the lobby in the morning and get a cup. The Manor is a block away from the main hotel--and once you make your way over there, you still have to meander around to find a coffee shop. I didn't mind having to pay for coffee--but it was $2.75, and it was bitter.

I thought that this hotel would be a great place for all ages to hang out--but you have to go through the casinos to get anywhere. In fact, at midnight, we saw small children who had apparently won stuffed animals at the midway sleeping in the hallway outside the casinos, sacked out on their new toys. There was no seating anywhere--except in the casinos--so my mom, who is on a walker, couldn't just sit and watch the kids play. In fact, when we were checking in, we stood in line for 40 minutes--and there was no place to sit and wait.

I thought the staff were very nice; but it just didn't serve our needs. I will say that 2 out of 3 rooms were nice enough--esp for the price we were paying. And we felt safe enough. (I read one review that mentioned being held up by gunpoint.) We saw bicycle police everywhere. One young man came around asking people for change--but when we said no, he moved on without any threat.

Anyone who chooses to stay here should bring his/her own coffee, and be prepared to walk a long way. We drove in--so it was very nice to have our car close by for loading and for moving around the town. I would have hated to have to use the valet service every time we wanted to drive somewhere.</p><br>you get wat u pay for<p>went to manor lodge in circus circus for our 25th wedding anniversary our main part of our holiday was hawaii so only wanted a cheap place to stay and also didn,t want a high rise building. it isn,t to bad the smell that other people hav wrote about is carpet cleaner which they seem to put down on the carpets in the mornings when they r cleaning its only in the first part of the building. there is no kettle or coffee maker in the rooms so if u want one u will hav to take your own. we stayed on the ground floor which wasn,t very good as we didn,t open our curtains as there was a car park right outside our window so everyone could see straight in also the window was bolted up so if u had to get out in an emergency u couldn,t. i wouldn,t stay there again if i went to vegas again i would stay in a different hotel. circus circus is not right on the strip so i would stay closer to everything as a lot of walking or bus rides.
the buffets were good in some hotels but not so good in others. we found circus circus was cheap and ok but the mirage, luxor was dearer but better, the excaliber was also nice and not to expensive.
we went to grand canyon in helicopter ,heli usa. we had 6 people in the helicopter plus pilot it was very crowded. we went on the ranch wasn,t much to see or do there the only good thing was one cowboy there who sang to us everything was rushed. we brought the dvd they sold which we thought was going to b about us but it was about 5 mins of us then the rest was advertising.
the staff in the main part of the hotel weren,t very helpful we tried to make a phone call home as our mobiles wouldn,t work there but noone really wanted to help us with the phones there.
be warned don,t walk round all hotels on your first day as u won,t b able to walk again the hotels arn,t as close together as they seem. get the duece bus 15 dollars for a 3 day pass, 7 dollars 24hrs and 3 dollars one way.</p><br>Should have stayed at a Motel 6!!<p>The Circus Manor (slums of circus circus) is a separate building that sits across from the main towers. Upon entering the room two lights did not work. The beds were as if we brought our own cots! The safe had a hole in it and there was no lock. The stench was that of smoke, must and 30 years of drugs, prostitution and mold. We had to take all our luggage and haul it across the street to the manor which was a pain! It is not even relatively close to the casino in the hotel, nor was it close to any strip! So if you want to stay at a place where you could wake up and go down to the casino...do not stay in the Circus Manor. Upon complaining to the front desk, we received a free room upgrade to the main tower where the hotel is. And while that room was significantly better(flat screen tv, kingsize pillow top bed,beautiful scenery and clean bathroom), it is not even close to the glamor rooms of better more upscale hotels on the strip. The Manor rooms were like a bad dream and my spouse and I were scared of being mugged while walking back and forth from the "main" hotel. Word of advice...DO NOT STAY HERE! Spend the extra cash to enjoy your stay, otherwise it will ruin your vacation. I can see why the circus is free, they needed to provide more incentive!</p><br>Needs to be demo<p>I have stayed in some motels that looked, smelled and felt better than this "hotel". My husband wanted to surprise me with a last minute trip to Vegas. He booked everything, the Circus Circus Manor was the cheapest "hotel" he could find. Once we arrived I noticed why. The bed sheets were dirty, the room smelled like [--] just bad!</p><br>If you smoke this is your place.<p>First let me pointout we were staying at CC just for the night as we drove thru Vegas on our way to Disneyland. Needless to say we were looking for something inexpensive. You surely get what you pay for.
First impressions are scarey as the parking lot was a circus to get thru. The crowd of people walking around was also scarey. You could pick out the prostitutes waiting in the lobby for their Jon. We choose not to eat at any of the restaurants within and instead drove across freeway to eat at Macaroni Grill (very nice). Landry's was next door.

Check in was not so bad until we got to our room (in main tower)and the keycards would not work. We had to go back to the front desk 2 times in attempt to fix the problem. After the 3rd try they ended up upgrading us to a nicer room in the West tower. The registeror commented they were over booked by 60 rooms.

While to the room was clean and nicely decorated, it was so smokey we could hardly breathe. Anytime you see an ashtray in the bathroom it is not a good sign. I travle with feebreze and candles and that still did not help the smell. The air conditioner worked good but my husband felt it brought in more smoke. Suprisingly the beds were very comfortable and the pillows were even goose-down. We had a good night sleep until our kids woke us up at 6:30am raring to go. We took advantage of the chance to check out early and get on the road again to our final destination. We ate breakfast at the Denny's across the street on Vegas Blvd. Service good and fast..

We did not go on any of the rides since we were taking kids to Disneyland the next day.</p><br>I'll Never Stay Here Again<p>Stayed here for two nights in June. The "manors" are back behind the actual casino and hotel. Walking back there at night was a scary experience. The rooms themselves were in terrible condition -- bad beds, carpet stains, missing fixtures, etc. In addition, the Circus Circus is so far away from everything, that you are much better off just spending an extra $50 or so a night and staying some place nicer and further down the strip. Just getting to the hotel from the manors is a walk. I will never stay there again.</p><br>You get what you pay for..simple as that.<p>It really is not as bad as people claim, sure it is old and needs repairs, and updating but so would you if you had that many people tromping all over you day in and day out!! YES there are a lot of kids there.

We stayed in the Manor B main floor over New Years 2007, with our 2 teenagers(15 yr olds) and infant daughter, the teenagers enjoyed it, they had the chance to go and check out the AdventureDome and had a good time on the rides and with the games. We had considered staying in the towers but once we got to the hotel I am glad we did not, it is a complete zoo to park, to get on the elevator, in the Manor rooms you park your own vehicle and you can park it where you can see it from your room.

Check in: only took about 10 mins, we were pre-registered and had no problems with lost registration etc, we had our confirmation letter with us and it was smooth sailing. And we checked in on the 29th of December, which is one of the busiest days to check in at the CC.

Our Room: Like I said it was in Manor B, the room was very large, everything worked, altho the toilet was a bit noisy, the towels were white and fluffy, not dungy or dirty, worn etc. The sheets and bed spreads were clean and the beds were comfortable(no springs poking out), we had clean towels each and every day, and the room cleaned and vacuumed every day. The few times we called housekeeping(to get more towels or pillows and a new bedspread after baby peed on the other one)it was delivered our room in plastic with in 20 mins. Nothing was stolen out of all our luggage, and trust me we had a lot as we were at the end of a month long trip, so we had purchased a lot of things and brought it all in our rooms in rubbermad totes as we did not want to leave it in the truck as we went about our sightseeing. There was security at each door of the Manor and they did not let anyone in that did not have a card. The room walls are a bit thin so you can hear the tv in the room next to you, but for the most part it did not matter, we were not there that much other then to sleep and when we finally did get back we were too tired to care. The bathroom was very very clean, I was not worried about putting my 6 mos old baby in the tub at all.

Check out went just as fast as the check in, and there is a $1.00 day charge for the phone. We had pre paid the hotel bill in order to get the reduced rate for the 4 nights we stayed there, so we were wondering how many extras would be added, but it was only the phone, so we were happy to see that was the only charge!

All in All...you get what you pay for, if you don't like kids stay away, if you don't like average run of the mill rooms in a busy hotel, don't book the manor rooms!</p><br>Far, old, outdated &amp; cheap<p>First let me say that Circus Circus is on the Vegas Strip but far from the "real Strip" action. So you either have a rental car or be prepared to wait long for the bus or walk long distances to everywhere. There is a whole block under construction that is scarry to walk at night.
We stayed on the Manor motel section as it was cheaper, and yes, it was cheap, you get what you paid for - and less! We had the kids with us and thought that Circus Circus would be a good location for 'family oriented" attractions. The adventurdome (ïndoor amusement park on premises) is somewhat OK, however, it is starting to show some evidence of aging and the same neglect you see in the rest of the hotel. Swimming pools are small for the size of the hotel and not anything extraordinary. Rooms were smelly, uncomfortable beds, rusty fixtures in bathroom, safe not working, missing pictures on wall. Non-smoking section, that is a joke, it is within the same building where the smoking section is and the two sections are only separated by a door. Next to two streets with a lot of traffic and noise. You would be better off by staying at the Excalibur or on an off-strip hotel. Do not come without a car if traveling with kids, it would be too much walking for them.</p><br>Over priced ,Staff is Rude, Dirty<p>Well first off we go to check in and they tell me no kids are suppose to stand because of the machines ok so what was i going to do leave my 7 yr old outside while i checked in. Than my mother in law had to use the restroom so me and my son waited by the door of the rest room 2 security gaurds comes over and tells me once again no kids to stand because of the machines ok well than he says its on non stopping zone alright well how did i know where are the stopping zones.so i tell the secutity i only booked this place for my son since it has rides,games had lots to do for kids. He says well this is not a kids place, ok i understand it is a casino but if you where not trying to attract the kids why would you put a roller coaster in , a water ride ex tell me what 60yr old person wants to go on a roller coaster.So than we go to our room now i have to tell you my father in law is handicap and my mother in law has bad knees they give us a room that we had to walk through the whole darn place felt like a mile.than we are put up on the highest floor. when we opened the door it looked like a 24 hr place where you bring a fling, it was dirty smelly and the carpets where all stained. We complained and they did give us another room which was very nice.
But than we decide to eat in the pizza place , well you have to cross the gaming floor to get to the pizza place what do you know the security officers want to come over to yell again about no kids on the gaming floor , how the yeck can we get to the pizza place without going across the floor.It was a complete let down the whole place. For one all the time i got yelled at about the gaming floor i don't even gamble, i came to this hotel for my son.Its not a very friendly place to stay at all. Another thing for the guard saying its not a kids place their sign has a clown holding a lollipop,rollercoaster,water ride and sponge bob movie i don't know of any adult that watches sponge bob for the yeck of it we all end up watching sponge bob because of the kids.my mother in law and father in law did not want to go to circus circus for the rides or the video games or the sponge bob movie.They came for their grandson.I will never ever recommend this dump to anyone.Plus one of the staff sad no speak english, well i don't speak spanish so before they get a job there they should be able to speak english considering this is america and if i went to another country i would have to try to learn their language.</p><br>Absolutely, completely disgusting<p>You know you're in for an interesting experience when you tell a cab driver to take you to Circus Circus Manor, and he spends the 15 minute ride making fun of the place and pitying you. That happened to me last week. The rooms? Totally disgusting. My colleague found a cigarette butt on the bedspread in her non-smoking room, while my room featured ripped sheets on the bed, questionable brown stains on the bathroom linoleum, and a moldy shower. While this "hotel's" run-down appearance and poorly-lit hallways may seem "edgy" and "exciting" to some, it's pretty much unacceptable for non-Third-World travellers. In retrospect, I should have found a nice bathroom stall at the Venitican and camped out there for a few days--it definitely would have been cleaner.</p><br></body></html>
