<html><head><h3>Circus Circus Manor Motor Lodge Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 7</h3></head><body><br>Basic but clean<p>Second trip over to Vegas this year and the second time in the Manor Lodge part of the Hotel. As I was there on business and have no real interest in gambling, it wasn't really important to me what the facilities were like. The rooms are clean and decent enough and I had no issues whatsoever.

Internet access is pretty bad though and barely connects.</p><br>OK Hotel<p>Liked Manor Lodge because of convenience of its parking. You can park right next to your building. Our room was basic but clean. The hotel itself is very old, dark, needs major face lift. Dinner Buffet was very decent: American favorites, a little bit of Italian and Asian food. If you can pay more, stay somewhere else. Otherwise it was Ok choice for a short trip, anyway you spend most of your day walking around Las Vegas.</p><br>DO NOT STAY HERE! AVOID!!!<p>This place is complete filth. Stay far away from here. The casino part is full of kids and I mean hundreds running around everywhere. The carpet everywhere has food all over and just plain filthy! I'm sure they have bed bugs but I didn't stay to find out! Absolutely horrible! No matter what it costs and how much someone will pay you do NOT do it! This is the ghetto!</p><br>Nightmare<p>Cheap-Cheap. It seems this property has no engineering or housekeeping PM program in place.We stayed in room 2551,smoke detector is covered by plastic bag,no hangers,old furniture's,ripped wallpaper,water leak stained ceiling,dirty and gross toilet,broken toilet seat,hair in the tub and floor and dirty carpet,cheap soap bars,and smelled so bad!
Room Tip: If you never been in (TJ),here is the place to experience.

Towel sizes are for children - what a joke!
Miniature soap bars for bathing?
No other amenities other than a bar of soap and tiny bottle of shampoo.
No beverages in room!
Don't stay here ! It's horrible!</p><br>Gross<p>People passed out in the halls, cigarette butts in the carpet of our room, and a comforter that had burn marks and smelled like a gym. It smelled so bad, and the windows were welded shut. We couldn't even stay one night.</p><br>Cheep Stay=Poor service<p>We are on a cross country trip so our car was full of items we needed to get to the room. Im a medically retired veteran so i needed help. I call for a bellhop who never came. So It took me an hour at least to get my own stuff to the room. Usually no problem, but at a resort a bellhop is an offered service. NOT in the manor. The room was in fair condition. Bed was comfortable the one plus. No fridge. we had a broken lamp which im shocked i didn't get shocked when reached to turn it on...no pun intended. If i had a chance to do it over again i would of payed more for a better hotel. Remember the manor is for people who are trying to party so we couldnt get much sleep because of the other patrons.
Room Tip: Stay in the towers not the manor

Circus Circus was the first hotel I stayed in in Vegas and found it a pleasant experience, for this trip one of the lads hadn't stayed at the Circus before so despite the fact we had a great stay last year at Riviera we decided to book in to Circus Circus where the difference between the hotels was 1 $.
Booking through Expedia we soon noticed that we had in fact been booked into the Manor Lodge out the back, this was not made clear upon booking so be warned. 2 of our party booked after us and were able to book into a Tower at Circus for no extra cost, when we arrived at reception though we were told that this would cost us an extra $120 per person.
The room itself in the Manor Lodge was fantastic, very spacious and clean but we were unable to connect to the WIFI which was dissapointing as this makes up most of the resort fee charge in the off months.
The distance you have to travel to get to the Lodge is the main reason why we wouldn't make the same mistake of booking this hotel through Expedia again when you know what you are getting at the Riviera for near enough exactly the same price.

For anyone wanting to stay here though please don't be put off by any of the reviews of the rooms as like I say the romm I had was fantastic, as were the rooms of my other two friends who had rooms in the Manor Lodge.</p><br>What a wonderful experience<p>I stayed here with some friends from Chicago,Il and it was very clean and the Queen bed slept comfortable. The rooms was spacious and the heat worked well. The employees greeted you with a smile at all times. The lobby of the hotel had a kiosk were you can take free photo shots and send them to your Face Book or Email address. The slots could of been a lot friendlier. LOl
Room Tip: The Manor Bay in building A were very nice. Rooms at the time was $25 a night.

I knew I would be staying in the Manor (not attached to the actual CC, but not far at all) I will admit, after reading pages and pages of negative reviews I was nervous and I do know it's nowhere near the standards of the other expensive resorts and hotels on the strip; but, I had a very pleasant experience in the manor. The beds were comfortable, the room was a fine size and it was clean. The building did smell a little weird but that's the worst I can say about my experience. If you're going to Vegas and looking for an inexpensive place to stay, I see no problems with CC.</p><br></body></html>
