<html><head><h3>Artisan Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 15</h3></head><body><br>great place to play and stay<p>My name is Osker. I had heard of the night life setting to be experienced at the Artisan hotel and decided to go and check it out for myself. I was impressed with just how many people were there dancing to really great DJs and enjoying cocktails from the large bar inside and outside on a relaxing patio. after a while i decided rather than take a cab home, I would check prices on the rooms there. the young lady at the check in counter was very helpful, sweet, and professional. Her name was Ally. i was blown away at how affordable the room was and was sold on the idea of just staying and not worrying about how to get home. the room itself was really contemporary, clean, and cozy. I recommend, the Artisan to anyone who enjoys dancing and having drinks. Now I know next time I'll reserve a room first and just enjoy my night worry free.</p><br>UGH!<p>Ok so I booked this little mini vacation with my wife and another couple strictly by seeing it online.
It looked really cool with the boutique artsy theme through out and the topless pool...which I am always a sucker for!
We went with another couple and had booked two suites 6 months in advance. Once we arrived the gal at the front desk said they were over booked and did not have two suites!!! I asked how that was possible since we booked so far in advance? She rolled her eyes and said that was just the way it was. Really could not give a damn what we thought and we had to settle for something less. The place is an old Travelodge that they have completley rennovated. It does give you a sense of being in a different world as the sculptures and paintings displayed through out the property are really cool. They have a restaraunt that is mediocre at best and a bar that is pretty cool. The problem with the bar is that it plays REALLY did I say REALLY LOUD music all night until 8 or 9 am every morning!!!! We were on the fifith floor and our bed would shake to the music the entire night!!! Every Night!!!! ALL Night!!! OMG I thought I was going to jump!!!

Ok I have calmed down....
The pool is really very tiny and in the rear of the hotel. They have several cabanas and day beds out there as well. They even have an outdoor little bar and a waitress.

The problem is that they usually have an event of some kind going on evey weekend day and they rent out the cabanas ($450) and the day beds ($100) per day. If you do not pay you have nowhere to layout at the pool!!! I guess you could just sit in the pool all day and turn into a raisin...

The location of the hotel is great if you are a total loser and love the fact that you can walk to 6 different stanky strip clubs from the hotel front door. I am not kidding 6 strip clubs within a couple blocks!!!

Oh well...we learned our lesson! I hope you take my negative review to heart and never visit this over priced rip off of a place! It should of stayed a Travelodge!!!</p><br>Wow! This was Different, Funky and Cool<p>This is where adult fun lives in Las Vegas. Discovered by accident, we spent one night at the Artisan arriving around noon. So the fun started with the couples only topless pool, moved to the dining room for a late dinner and then it was party on with dancing, beverages, interesting people and more fun. After some recovery sleep it was back to the pool for the late morning where we stayed a couple of hours after our checkout. If you've had it with the elbow to elbow strip complete with service with an aditude, this is your place. Great staff, very good food and drinks. Decorated in what must have been inspired by the Hotel California this goes on the hotel bucket list for sure.
Room Tip: High up and away from the street will give you the quietest space.

The highway noise was there, but with the exception of the occasional passing Harley, it was largely white noise. We stayed here two nights...adjust your schedule so that you get to the Artisan at about 330am...it's tons of fun from 330am-630am or so. Great people watching and really interesting people to talk to. The pool was good enough, and the couples only topless pool party on Saturday is not to be missed. The food is only ok, and the location is not central to the strip, but you won't want to leave often anyway. Have fun!</p><br>Off the beaten strip<p>If you're in Vegas and you just wish to escape all they'd ness of the strip take a drive toward the Stratosphere and cross over the highway to find a small gem! Great bar, lounge and dining area on one side of the building and a pool on the other. Rooms are nice & service is great!</p><br>Not for the people waiting on the lame bus!!!<p>Pure fun! Seriously. Friends got a room cuz we were going out and getting nuts and ending here which it's a good idea to have a bed ready. We are locals. I'm a mommy and lawyer so I'm not captain nightlife but when I go you must go here. Dancing, music, lights, interesting people. It's the closest thing to the original studio 54 I can imagine. The security makes you feel safe, the Djs are on point and that male bartender is so gorgeous and silly flirty. Maybe he wants a tip, maybe he likes tall blondes with huge boobs and glasses, I don't know. Give him a raise. Memmorial day weekend is where I just was. Nap time. Love you artisan! Party.</p><br>Play here don't stay here<p>This is a great spot for late-night clubbing but my first stay here was also my last. I was aware that the after-hours club in the lobby was open til the early hours of the morning but didn't realize our room would be vibrating all night from the bass. We had to call several times to request toilet paper. Upon checkout I accidentally left behind a very expensive robe in the closet and upon calling several hours later and again the next day to ask about it, was told that nothing had been turned in. In all my travels this is the first time a personal item that got left behind was not returned. Not cool.</p><br>A hotel like no other!!!!!!<p>There really, truly is no place quite like the Artisan. Off-strip, it's a destination in and of itself.

This is not a hotel for people who intend to sleep (which is a big compliment); it's a hotel for fun-seekers and partiers who are prepared to do so ALL NIGHT LONG!

The art decor at the Artisan is beyond cool, and the dim lighting throughout the hotel adds an ambience of mysteriousness. The rooms are tastefully appointed and a hell of a bargain.

The (top optional) pool is a terrific little scene, and the never-closed bar was handy 24 hours a day.

We found the Artisan super sexy and can't wait to return!

Thanks, Dillon (Hotel Manager) for a way-better-than-expected experience for our whole group. We'll be back soon!</p><br>Great place....for adults.<p>A really engaging canvas art themed hotel for adults. The staff was very friendly, polite and accommodating. The lobby, lounge and rooms have a romantic atmosphere, which are dimly lit for effect. There is an after hours party Wed-Sat that rocks the lounge until 7AM. We requested a room away from the lounge on the 5th floor, and it was nice and quiet. The only disturbance at night was highway noise, but that was rare. You should be aware that the pool is top-optional and that the hotel welcomes gay and trans-gender. Valet parking is free, and you can self park across the street. If you're open minded you will enjoy this place.</p><br>Horrible service<p>Hotel needs to re-staffed especially management and housekeeping! When we checked in there was vomit throughout the lobby, staff was rude when we needed a room key reactivated, and I Was charged a $250 smoking fee twice due to having an empty pack of cigarettes in the trash. WORST PLACE EVER!!!!</p><br></body></html>
