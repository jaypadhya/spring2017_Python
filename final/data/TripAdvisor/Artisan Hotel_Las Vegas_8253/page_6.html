<html><head><h3>Artisan Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 6</h3></head><body><br>Like the Haunted Mansion<p>I've loved this hotel and bar since I first stepped into it, I got married there I love it so much, I've been seeing reviews about bed bugs so when we stayed there last week I brought a flash light with me to check EVERYWHERE. I did and I didn't find anything. We stayed 3 nights and never got bit. I think some rooms might have them but ours did not. Just check and if you find them ask for a different room. I agree with others that the staff is not friendly enough and actually give you an attitude most of the time, so that has to change if they want to survive. They also need to do some up keep on the pool area and the rooms. But regardless of all that I'll always love this hotel. Someone who cares needs to be in charge and hire the right people. Or I don't think they will be around much longer.
Room Tip: Higher floors have less noise

We love this pool! It's not for everyone as it's an adult environment but not the usual Vegas pool scene with the loud DJ and douchbag 20 something dudes. The scene is much more laid back especially on the week days. It's also a lot more "Naked" than the other Vegas European pools. It's off the beaten path and more private so it leads to a better vibe which makes everyone more comfortable getting naked. We always meet nice people here. It's very "lifestyle friendly" and more open to relax and have fun without all the over the top party scene that you get at the other adult pools in Vegas.
Just to set expectations, when we went on a Saturday, there was no drink service at the bar and no music but that was fine with us. We just walked down to the main bar for drinks and played our own music. Of course it's still April and "pool season" hasn't officially begun. Also, the pool is a bit cold now but it warms up by May.
Overall, it a comfortable place where you can have a great time and meet some fun people. If you enjoy wearing less to swim and sunbathe and don't mind a less crowded scene, this is your place.</p><br>Lovely and cute, but with a little downside.<p>The Artisan is a beautiful hotel. Completly different than and other hotel i've ever stayed. The room was big and clean and the bed was great. The staff is friendly. The art and design is unique and wonderful. The only downside of the hotel was the resort fee, which was a waste of money. The wi-fi on our floor didn't work and the pool was a little dirty (a lot of leaves and stuff in it, and the poolbeds were dirty).</p><br>Never seen such a bad staff<p>We booked a room for 4 for one night. When we arrive, they only had rooms with one bed! Since we booked via booking.com , they concidered that it was not their problem and wanted to be repaid for another room. They also refused to call booking.com. No commercial gesture, unpleasant staff.
Never again!</p><br>Very chic and different.<p>This hotel is definitely unique. The lobby is a work of art all by itself. The rooms are clean, and it is as advertised. Downside? Other than the valet staff, they aren't very friendly. The front desk staff are very indifferent. The bar at the hotel is expensive, ($10 a drink? I thought this was Vegas?)</p><br>Horrible Experience! Dishonest Staff!<p>Terrible Hotel!! Worst location ever. There is no parking, only valet. And half the time the valet isn't in front, so you have to ask the desk. They made us wait until 4:30pm before we could check into the room I had booked online. They charged my card $175 for "deep cleaning" and smoke damage because there was fast food garbage and someone put a cigarette butt in their pocket and it ended up in a beer bottle in the room.

They also pay people to write 5-star reviews.

Avoid these jerks at all costs! ! Also, Google "Artisan Hotel Bedbugs"</p><br>Very eclectic, very different but cool stay.<p>My boyfriend and I stayed one night and it is a cool place, very different. Eclectic is one word and sometimes a little creepy with the old gothic-art and ancient relics that filled lobby and hallways. But still, we liked it just because it was so different! They had a promotion for a bottle of champagne upon arrival and therefore we liked it even more. Each room is designed by a different artist. Our room was neat. Nothing over the top. And the place is really old but it looks like they are trying to update it. We had no problems with anything in our room, it could have been cleaner and less dingy looking (but that's the theme of hotel maybe??) and well for us all we cared about was a good bed and it was comfy. OH and we saw it's dog-friendly and that is awesome...however we didn't have the dog with us. But that's a great feature.

The nightclub downstairs is hopping but they don't hide that. They have information about their club and the after hours parties on their website and in their marketing. They even say #1 After Hours Club in Vegas! So if you come here and then have something bad to say about the noise, well you should have done your research first! I see people writing reviews about the noise, and I feel it's unfair to write a bad review if you are the one that should have researching more about the place you are choosing to stay. WE on the other hand chose this place for the fun nightlife and we had a blast in the club it was great!! And the next night they had a wine tasting event and we just walked up and paid for tickets and went to it. It was a pleasant surprise and we made friends. So there's no dull moment here. You will have a very fun time. If that's what you're into. And when we did go to bed, we didn't hear any noise from the club from our room.

The only downside is that it appeared as if there was a really cool restaurant on the premises called "Mood Restaurant" and the pictures on the website looked great. However it is not open daily for guests. It is for special events only RATS! My bad, I didn't see that part on the website, so when we got hungry, we couldn't get any room service. However there are places around the area you can order delivery to the room.

Overall cool place...it's adult only, keep that in mind you cannot have kids under 18 there. And I see why because of all the events and after hours. But I'd recommend for an affordable, different stay and a hopping lobby and bar/club area and you don't even need to leave the hotel to have a good time!</p><br>Needs updating<p>I live in Las Vegas and do mini stay vacations as a treat as Vegas has so much to offer. The hotel is quirky and has some great features such as the art. Great drinks at the bar and a pretty decent staff.

However the rooms are another story. A/C in the room did not work at all, way too hot. Couldn't call down to the front desk as the phone did not work. Not as clean as it should be. Very small and old towels.

The worst was the bed. The bed dipped in the middle something terrible. We would lay down and both roll to the middle. Trying to sleep was awful as there was no way to get comfortable with the dipping old mattress.

I would go back to enjoy the atmosphere and bar, but would never rent a room there again.</p><br>A Fetish Hotel for Adults!<p>I am a traveling business women, and NO WHERE in it's write-up did it state this is an ADULT Hotel
NOT a family hotel, and the Party starts at 12 midnight ending 6am!!
Too much noise, room not clean, no restaurant
ALL the rooms, hallways were 'dark'
They hold "Fetish" Ball in lounge, Did NOT sleep all night
WHY, upon my arrival did they not warn me of this type of hotel!!</p><br>Most eclectic and neat hotel in Vegas<p>If you're tired of the same old Vegas. The strips, clubs, and most of all high prices. This is a great place to visit. The lounges are amazing, the decor is so unique every where you look its something different and another photo opportunity. The pool area is clean but a small.
Room Tip: I've never stayed here but its worth a visit. Not the best neighborhood, but once inside it'...
