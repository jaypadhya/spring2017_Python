<html><head><h3>Artisan Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 9</h3></head><body><br>Clean But Loud<p>The hotel was okay. It was clean, but the air conditioning didn't work properly in our room. Additionally, we were right above a very poorly insulated night club that was hosting latin dance night for about 3 people. I wish I had known this at the time of booking as there was no option for a room in a different part of the hotel. The girl at the desk was snobbish when we asked if they had any rooms away from the club and asked if we would rather check in somewhere else. Thank goodness we were only there for a night.
Room Tip: Ask to be away from the night club.

We began with an awesome day at the couples themed pool party. Evolve. If you have visited other Vegas pools you know how hard it can be to get service. Ben and Tommy provided superior service with and outstanding attitude. As well, the crowd itself was super friendly and fun. We didn't get to try any of the night time events due to a concert (NIN) but when we returned to the hotel just after 2am people were still arriving and the place was hoppin. We stayed in room 503 and were very pleased with it. The decor and lighting at this property is dark so my wife did have a lighting problem when it came to getting ready and make-up. There is a lot of outside noise from either the nearby highway or late night parties so be forewarned that sleep may be a little hard..... We expected this per the reviews and like I said, we were here to enjoy the Vegas experience. We really enjoyed our stay at this hotel and our experience with the staff was great.</p><br>Mellow summer mid-week stay<p>If you have an odd numbered room on floor 4 or 5 you will have a nice view of the strip. We liked seeing the warehouse district in the foreground and the strip lit up in the background.

Due to the restaurant being closed off and the summer heat the place was empty. The decor is rad. The bar and pool were empty it was easy to score a cabana and chill out. Not much staff around - sort of annoying you have to go to the bar to get ice. The price was amazing $27 and a free bottle of twist top champagne - hilarious and just another $15 for a 3pm check-out.

The rooms are sexy and fun - we would definitely come back.
Room Tip: 5th floor odd numbered

It was under construction so the lobby and half of our floor was taped off. The receptionist checking us in wasnt so nice or helpful. No one helped with our bags. When we got to our room, there was a funny smell. The room was tiny compared to what I was expecting for that price or even from the pictures. The toilet paper holder was broken, and they geniusly put the garbage can under it, so when the toilet paper fell, it went into the garbage instead of the floor. We went to the bar and the bartenders looked over us at least twice, then were rude. Music was so loud you couldn't hear a thing. It was very dark at all times. Party lasted long after 7am. Pool had white stuff floating on top and leaves and pines. It was an OK stay but was disappointing in the end.</p><br>Trip with friends<p>We rode the MegaBus from Riverside, CA as an adventure trip and chose the Artisan from it website because it looked interesting. I will start with the good features. This is an interesting hotel off the strip. It is an adult only hotel, which was nice. There are works of art on all the walls and ceilings and in the rooms. The hotel is 5 floors. There is a bar and restaurant on site. The rooms are clean and a nice size but the whole place is in dark wood and very dark inside. They have a pool and it is topless (optional) and there were topless women in the pool during our stay. The staff was very friendly and helpful. It was nice just going around looking at all the art. A lot of the art is styled after the Master's of the 17th Century, a lot of nude works of art but very tasteful. The have an adults only channel that comes with the price of the room. Now for the down side. The hotel is right next to the 15 Interstate Highway and the traffic was very loud all night long. The hotel is not well insulated. The restaurant was closed due to a construction accident but it was not stated on the website. The hotel is not within walking distance of anyplace to eat. It is about 1.2 miles from the strip and not easy to get to a bus stop because of the highway and the very busy Sahara Blvd. (The bus system is a Plus) There is a bus stop in front of Palace Station. The bus system is very good in Vegas and it will save you a lot of head aches if you are trying to drive around Vegas and Taxis are not inexpensive in Vegas. The bus system offers a 2 hour pass for $6.00, a 24 hour pass for $8.00 and a 3 day pass for $20.00. The pass is good for any bus in Vegas so you can pretty much go anywhere. That is a plus. The prices for drinks were very high, especially since they are so far from everything else. On Wed, Fri and Sat nights they have music in the bar (DJ) from 10 pm until 4 pm, but the music was so loud we could not stay in the bar. We could not hear the music from our room but our friends who where on the 4th floor stated it was hard to sleep because of the booming bass sounds from the bar. This is probably not a place we would stay again because of the location but it was a fun hotel and it if was not as noisy and more accessible to other places it would be a great place.
Room Tip: If you like loud music, partying and adult themes this is a fun place to give a try.

The whole staff was super courteous and the Management Tara treated us like a close friend she had known for years. Would visit here again to party!</p><br>Always a great time at the Artisan Hotel<p>We are a married couple who's youngest child celebrated his 21st birthday in Artisan's best suite a year and a half ago. Who says that you have to be close to 21 years old to enjoy the after hours scene. We love this place and most of the staff. We have always received EXCEPTIONAL service from every aspect of service except for the house keeping staff. Every time we stay longer than 4 days here it seems that whomever is assigned to service our room will ignore the "Do not disturb" sign and wake us up REAPEATEDLY. The only maid who has been assigned to our room but has still provided exceptional service is their youngest housekeeper. We don't know her name but she is a short dark haired Latina who always has a smile on her face.

We love the laid back staff and party atmosphere.</p><br>GORGEOUS ENTRY, STUNNING LOBBY, MUSIC NEVER ENDS<p>We couldn't wait to book this hotel and we knew it would be different, all the different reviews made it difficult to choose this hotel and off strip always makes it more confusing. Well this is the best review I will give on Trip Advisor so others have an idea of what to expect.

We arrived to a beautiful valet entry of the Artisan Hotel and was amazed of the vegetation, the trees, the whole entry is remarkable. Valet is 4 stars!! very nice, polite and made you feel welcomed every time we returned back from the day.

Entering the lobby it was dark, cozy and has a sexy aura about it. Check in was simple and organized, the male who checked us in was very good but however the front desk clerks beyond that, definately don't make you feel interested in answering any questions you may have about the property or surrounding area and every question seemed to have a undesirable response. I have stayed at Marriotts before with 5 stars customer service, I wasn't expecting that but even the waffle house has an immediate hello and thank you for coming which MAKES customer service your first feeling of how the service will be. So needless to say 2 stars for the front desk.

The room was awesome, seemed to be remodeled, great amenities, awesome view of strip and tiny view of pool but the room was great!! 4 stars for that (Porno station reruns same movie all wknd, c'mon guys).

Now to the lounge/nightclub. Simple, great decor, great patio and interesting. Great place to be with someone or meet someone because it could be real romantic and cozy!!, but the music is sooo damn loud you cannot hear each other and its not geared towards the middle age crowd.The bartenders were really not welcoming and actually seemed annoyed when we tried to spark a conversation or have questions about the property. So 2 stars for that staff.

The Pool is simple, nice and can be relaxing if they played soft top 40's or 70-80's music but the Techno, Thump Thump music at 8am is absolutely REDICULOUS. You party all night whether at the hotel or on the strip and get home at 4 am and I could sleep through the crazy after hours lounge music but when it goes from there to the pool at 8 am everyday!!, music so loud that from the fifth floor I thought the room next door was having a party. It was disgraceful and I have read the reviews on the music and thought I could sleep through it. NEGATIVE. Sunday morning it started up and about an hr later it shut off, It was the best morning I had and that means sleeping!!

The perfect Artisan would be the party stops at 4a.m and the pool music turns on at 11 am, descent pool music not the pounding speaker driven techno music and conversation around the pool would increase and probably also the traffic by more couples. I am probably missing something but I did give it 3 stars!! the property is beautiful, the housekeepers and valet were perfect and made you feel at home, but as my fiancee said,,"I will not come back here because staying out all night we need sleep in the morning and this party music at 8 am doesn't allow us to recoup for the next night out. I understand they only have 3 floors of occupancy so the bar after hours club probably generates a whole lot of money which we both understood, but the hotel environment should not be ruined by the continuous thumping techno around the clock base music. The general manager was very polite and courteous, but its all about the bottom line and in vegas you have to find your niche, but the guest will always return, the young kids partying will always move on.
Room Tip: 5th floor facing strip is beautiful, beware music by after hrs bangs all night and music by pool run...

Being someone on low salary, I thought this hotel really cares for it guests until I was told I could not use the pool. Be very careful to confirm what you can use in the hotel. I think the pool is one of the coolest in Vegas, but I can't go there.</p><br>Beautiful Fun Hotel!<p>My husband and I stayed at the Artisan for a few days in April. It was our 1st anniversary and we wanted something fun and special. We were not disappointed! The lobby of the hotel was breathtaking, the service was fantastic and our room was clean.
Room Tip: We stayed on the 5th floor (room 525). From this room I could not hear the fantastic dance party dow...
