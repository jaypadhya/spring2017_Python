<html><head><h3>Artisan Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 27</h3></head><body><br>A fun place to stay<p>I recently stayed at The Artisan Hotel due to the convenience of the location of my weekend meeting. The staff is extremely friendly from the time you drop your car off at valet to the time you check out. I much surprised to find the GM, Mr. Martine checking me in and checking me out the next day. I assume this man never sleeps or is very loyal to his job. Thank you Mr. Martine for the positive attitude, as someone in the profession is was real pleasure. I was able to make some time and wonder down to the bar area during the night to see the nightclub, most impressive! Had a bite to eat, and then off to bed. The hallways are a bit noisy, but I would expect nothing less from how busy the nightclub and bar was. Thanks again to the Staff.</p><br>What a Gem in a tacky Town<p>I love this place, no kids, no slot machines, pure class. The oil paintings are great, the restaurant was great, the staff is so friendly, and the other guests are stunning. The pool is great, the bar looked like it was from Paris or New York. I love this hotel and gess what - the price to stay here is great - very cheap for what you get. Loved the friday ans Saturday nightclub, tons of good looking people.</p><br>You might save some money, but it's not worth it.<p>Let me start by saying I have visited for Las Vegas many, many times and also lived there for about a year. The Artisan hotel is the worst hotel I have ever stayed at in Vegas and one of the worst I've stayed at anywhere. Most of the staff are rude, snobby and unhelpful. The location is horrible, there are no hotels or restaurants within walking distance unless you want to eat dinner at a strip club. You HAVE to park valet which is a big hassle because nothing is walking distance and waiting for your call all the time is no fun. The elevator seemed like it might break down at any minute. The floor we stayed on had uneven tiles that I tripped over, paintings of naked people on the walls and red lighting you might find at a brothel. Our room was small and only had one bed even though we reserved two beds (apparently they ran out and 3 people had to sleep in one bed). I ordered "room service" which came up in a plastic bad and had a $3 dollar delivery charge plus 20% gratuity attached that wasn't specified on the menu. The after hours club reminded me of a high school dance and the loud bass could be heard from almost anywhere in the hotel. This is not a good place for families, it's not a good place if you want to sight see or gamble (no casino), I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.</p><br>Don't book for a wedding,<p>We got married here. We booked almost the entire hotel for our event. We were not provided any of the things we requested such as a weather plan! The wedding planner assured us if it was cold we could move inside, what she failed to mention is the club/bar would be open to the public till 7am. After hours begins at 10 30.  It is a small place. The outdoor heaters were minimal we were offered blankets that never arrived. We asked for nice champagne and paid for top shelf and didn't get it, we had to buy our own speakers for our dj and the food sucked and minimal. Everyone of our guests complained about the service.  My man and I are both successful members of our community and also very open minded but all of our complaints were ignored, no special considerations were taken into account. We brought an amazingly hip crew of top athletes, fashion editors, industry icons 
and everyone said we had the best ceremony they ever attended but everything else about the hotel was a disappointment. The chapel is cute but very small. We had to call the coordinator for a month to get our photos. We called everyday with out a response and not until I stopped payment on our credit card did our photos show up.  Our wedding appeared in various publications and we would have been happy to promote a place that had even the most basic common service expectations.  I called the manager on several occasions and the only response when I challenged our charges and instead of calling me to discuss blatantly lied about thier lack of ability to honor their contract. I have never written a critical review online and we have traveled all over the world and are big supporters of small, privately owned boutique hotels, which is why we chose what we thought would be a unique, special venue.  Fortunately we had a wonderful time with friends and family anyways as we were all happy to be celebrating but don't expect this establishment to do anything to support a special day or on going business from you or your group.  They clearly have a good after hours business and as a result the other aspects of business seem to fall below even the most basic expectations.  I am not kidding we called the wedding planner Cynthia a hundred times for answers, why we paid for vueve and didn't get it, why the space heaters outside didn't work or there were not enough, why my grannies couldn't get a blanket, why we didn't have a weather indoor solution,  We had to go rush to buy our own speakers for sound! Why it took over a month to get our pictures, why one guest (famous accomplished athlete) had to wait for four hours for his room service! So I will wage a online campaign and so will all of our guests.  The power of the net.  Love my family, friends and my husband, not a fan of the artisan.</p><br>Really cool place to stay but bring your earplugs if you need a double bed!<p>Recently went to a wedding at this hotel and stayed 2 nights. Great location minus the interchange of the freeway noise. The entire north side of the hotel has the double beds so we couldn't move to the south ,"king bed" side, which I bet was quieter. It's very close to the strip, which was fun. There are a ton of strip clubs right next door and all along that same road which could be offense to some. However, we never saw any crude or shady activity outside of them. The decor is really cool! Smells like a sweet pipe the minute you walk through the door. Reminded me of a gents club. Rooms were clean. Staff was very helpful and hospitable. Didn't blink an eye at us wanting to change rooms because of the noise. Chapel was really nice. Patio off the bar was fun to hang out at. The art EVERYWHERE is captivating and entertaining. Overall a good experience and fun to hang out at! Great bell service too!!! thanks guys!</p><br>Bring Earplugs<p>Let me first say that the Artisan Hotel is definitely a must see. Very cool decor, and clearly it's a place to be seen as far as nightlife is concerned.

My terrible experience however, relates to their service as a hotel rather than as a nightclub. It would definitely seem that they are less focused on the former than latter. (My wife and I are in our 20's, and pretty open-minded to any experience. We're also Vegas locals, and have stayed at several places up and down the Strip, if that makes any difference.)

We checked into our room in the around 5pm, and the room was adequate. Cozy with very cool decor, but nothing fantastic. We left the place to eat dinner and see a show elsewhere, and when we came back around midnight, the party was in full-swing. We had to show our room keys just to bypass the nightclub line that had formed in front of the hotel... no big deal.

We went to the bar, had a couple drinks, a smoke, and decided to turn in... apparently this was our mistake.

Around 5am, we were awoken to a party in our 5th floor hallway. This is beyond the control of the hotel if no one reports, so I called the front desk.

A really uninterested guy answered the phone to take my complaint. He promised to send security up to check it out.

Meanwhile, the party gets louder, they begin smoking in the hallway which comes right under the door and right through the vents into the room, and they are calling their friends in the club downstairs to join them at the top of the 5th floor elevator.

I wait 10 minutes for this all to be handled by security... nothing. I call downstairs again and am told that security would be up shortly. 10 more minutes and no change.

I call a 3rd time, and am told by the same guy that they've been sent and he offers to move me to another room. Now, I appreciate the concession, but the offer is somewhat insulting... my wife and i are going to pack up our entire room, change out of our pajamas, walk through the party in the hallway, and settle into a new room at at 5am? No thanks.

So I open the door to find security ... who has finally arrived, but instead of breaking up the party, they only ask them to take it to their room, where they proceed to pump techno music ad nauseum so that entire hallway sounds like a rave.

There was no sleep to be had. Being locals, we did decide to pack up all of our things and change into our regular clothes, but we just walked out and went home. Night ruined.</p><br>We came looking for bedbugs, but we left having had a BLAST!!<p>We drove in really late on a Friday night, and hadn't planned our stay in advance, so we didn't have a grand plan. Our original idea was to keep costs down, so basically, being on a budget, we were fine with going to the hotel that has interior design with a TON of clowns. :) Well when we got to Clown Manor, and walked up the hallways to our actual room, it was an experience my wife and I would never want to ever repeat. The place smelled like a sewer in the hallways, and in the actual room--well let's just say the bed looked like the an amusement park for bed bugs.
[[Look, I know this is a review for Artisan--just bear with me... Getting to the good part! Trust me! :)]]
So at 2 in the morning, we dug around more on the internet and found this hotel called Artisan. My wife gave them a call, and the guy who answered said they had vacancy, for 75$. We headed over to the new hotel, wary of more budget-stay nightmares.
The valet was busy, and the place was thumping with club music, and people were all lined up to enter. It was a techno party atmosphere, and the the decor had victorian and renaissance elements, but definitely with a cool twist! The walls and ceiling were all black and covered with paintings, stylish mirrors, and statues. I seriously felt like I was in a Blade movie--expected Wesley Snipes to jump out of the bar, and onto a table. It really was a striking look--different from all the other brightly lit casino-hotels on the Strip.

We went upstairs, and the the halls continued the cool art theme. Our room was the Pieter Bruegel--apparently every room was named for an artist, and featured pieces of that particular artist's work,. there were funky arrangements of mirrors, a great HD Plasma TV, and the bed was extremely comfortable! We loved it! We had a comfortable little loveseat, and tasteful chairs.The bed, the bathroom, and the whole room was really put together with the thoughful decor.

The next morning we went about touring the hotel: we liked the pool with the cabanas, the bar/restaurant was just really cool, and we took a few pictures with the art work in the main lobby. Overall, it was really enjoyable and memorable stay. We recommend this place for couples and 20-30 somethings looking for fun and something different, and not typical Strip. The location wasn't obvious--helped to have a GPS, but after we parked, it didn't matter. This is a REAL hidden gem of LV--we would definitely stay again, great price and damn cool experience!</p><br>a complete surprise, and a great find.<p>I wasn't sure what to think of the hotel from the web and other resources from before I'd come to stay there. The building is rather unassuming from the outside, however once I entered it is like a separate world, even from Vegas. There are no casino machines blaring or the usual Vegas obnoxiousness. The lobby was dark, filled floor to ceiling with art, statues, and mirrors. The Massive fountain, woodwork, and being nearly solely lit by candles scattered around really set the tone. It had the feeling of something both extremely comfortable and yet still exciting and rich in ambiance. The staff was welcoming and very helpful. The room was clean and well decorated. Even the halls, with the continued art and mirror motif felt like I was in an actual "place" not just the usual sterile Vegas experience. The hotel feels like it really has a soul and an identity that isn't as interchangeable like most in town. The bar was great, nice and dark and friendly. The restaurant (mood) was excellent, with attentive service and the food was fantastic (highly recommend the pork chop). Staying at Artisan was a great experience, one that I hope to repeat and highly recommend.</p><br>A unique destination; would happily stay there again.<p>Was greeted by a richly decorated lobby and giant fountain. Every square inch of the lobby/restaurant/halls etc is covered in ornately framed artwork and/or mirrors. Unlike any other destination in Vegas; in a good way! Room was a bit mellower but kept with the overall aesthetic. Clean and tidy. Caught happy hour in the bar/lounge and had a very good pork chop in the restaurant that evening. Was quiet mid-week, but I hear they have a good afterhours scene on the weekend.</p><br>Best Place in Vegas<p>From the time I pulled up to valet, lobby, check in, elevator, halls, room, restaurant, bar - This hotel is the coolest place I have ever seen. There is art everywhere (hence the name ARTisan). walls, ceilings OMG !!!!
Once I walked into the Artisan, I completely forgot I was in vegas - This Boutique Hotel could be in San Francisco, Downtown Chi Town or even in Soho. What a breath of fresh air this hotel is. The staff is there to make sure you have the best experience.....They did not fail. They went out of there way to make sure I had the best stay. The food in their restaurant is awesome. I had the most amazing time in their bar. Their bartenders can make anything you want. The drink prices have to be at least half of what I have paid on the strip. If you don't stay here .....shame on you.....if you do.....well you are in for great service, food to die for and drinks to match.</p><br></body></html>
