Mostly visited by locals and on weekends the nightclub hosts some of the crazy people in Vegas. Good place to have fun and party but not so great to relax or have a sound sleep. Kids are no no here.</p><br>It's SO beautiful in here!<p>My boyfriend chose The Artisan for his bday trip (it's his favorite in Vegas) and I have now been introduced to my new favorite Vegas hotel as well. They upgraded us to the Masterpiece sweet at no extra charge (we played pool on our in-room table all night) and said that they hoped he was enjoying his birthday. On top of that, it's absolutely the coolest hotel interior in all of Vegas (and quite possibly anywhere!)</p><br>My favorite spot!!<p>I have stayed with Artisan numerous of times in the last four years. I have always had the best service and clean rooms. I always choose this as my first choice if available while staying in Las Vegas even if there is no availablilty its the best after hours spot! I always refer my friends and family when they stay in Vegas! I have the best time here! Getting ready to plan my summer getaway here soon!</p><br>Dirty<p>There were no rooms available for early check in. Once I checked in, I looked at the sheets (white linen) and they were disgusting. I requested clean sheets within minutes of checking in and they were never brought. I'll never stay here again and I'll make sure everyone I know doesn't either.</p><br>Beautiful place<p>The Artisan was a wonderful place to spend a night away from "Las Vegas", we're locals and stayed on a Thursday night to avoid the big weekend crowds, and didn't want to stay on the strip either. Everything was perfect and completely beautiful, the best interior design and decorating iv'e seen in Vegas. It felt like we were in CA. All the staff was kind and accommodating, the food and drinks were great, and we will definitely be staying again.</p><br>Will not stay here<p>I booked The Artisan despite not seeing rave reviews. It was a good price and we were taking a few of my daughters friends, so needed two rooms. I was using Expedia to book the rooms and chose The Artisan because they offered $0 money down now and you could pay full amount at time of arrival. I hadn't received the money from the friends for the other room so I thought this would be the safest because I could cancel at anytime if they backed out. After booking, I noticed almost half of the cost of the rooms was already charged to my bank account. It was supposed to be $0 due so when I called The Artisan they informed me that even though I booked with Expedia and it said $0 due, they still charge for first night and taxes. The woman I spoke to had an attitude and could care less that this was a problem for me. She told me to call Expedia and cancel if I didn't like it. I did just that and complained to Expedia. Expedia is going to look in to it and were very apologetic. I will now book elsewhere with a better reviewed hotel and better customer service.</p><br>Mistake to stay here <p>If you want to get a minutes sleep, avoid it at all cost. Staff is friendly, decor is interesting, but this is an all-night dance club, and the rooms lack any soundproofing. To repeat, this is a nightclub first, and a hotel second. Do not stay here.</p><br>Don't expect to sleep. at all. seriously.<p>We had an Alumni party here and decided to spend the night so we didn't have to drive home after open bar. Upon arrival, valet was courteous, but front desk lady, Michelle Jackson, I think? was quite snarky. We asked about a late check out and she quoted us the prices like we couldn't afford them (I think it was like $35 or something). all righty……
So, I suppose if you're into gothic/baroque/tacky/dark/weird decor, then this place is right up your alley. Walls are black, paintings made you wrinkle your face and say Huh? and then mirrors, big and small were all over the ceilings. Not like "watch yourself in bed" mirrors, just weirdly placed tiny mirrors everywhere. So, Ok, it's a Mardi Gras party, we'll be sloshed, weird decor is better than a DUI. Our party ended after 10 and then their "party" started at 11. I honestly felt like I was in that bad Night at the Roxbury movie. We waited forever for a cab and just went over to Palace Station to play a little and get some food…..because the catered "food" they provided for our party consisted of a cheese & cracker plate, a guy walking around with frozen/deep fried chicken dumpling things (I own a restaurant, one can tell when a frost-bitten bag of food has been dumped into a deep fryer.) and then some flatbread pizza (which was actually pretty good, but we only saw that guy once) that had been cut into tiny squares. We heard a rumor that some sliders were floating around, but we never found him. So we get back at around 2am, and the club on the first floor (east side) is going strong. Our room was on the 3rd floor, but all the way on the west side. We could hear every single THUMP THUMP THUMP of the bass all the way to our room. Our view was also of the hwy (to be fair, this hotel does not have a "good" view of anything), so every 20 minutes or so an ambulance/firetruck/police went by with sirens blaring. Got up at 4 to use the tiny bathroom facilities and THUMP THUMP THUMP was still going strong….sounded like the same song to me, but what do i know about club music. I was young once, I stayed out til 4, so whatever….thump away. I wake up at 7 am and it's STILL THUMPING! It's 7am people, go home, go to ihop, go somewhere! It just sucked. I didn't check out the pool, and didn't see a restaurant (didn't actually look), as I already knew that I'll never be back. This place seems pretty popular, so apparently it's filling a niche….just not the preppie golfer crowd.</p><br>AWFUL!! +++<p>I booked this hotel after visiting the website, seeing photos and reading description. Going for birthday celebrations with girlfriend so looking forward to decent hotel with restaurant and relatively quiet setting off the strip. What we were greeted with was COMPLETELY different! Very run down looking compared to site pictures, very dark lobby in mid day. Artwork was over the top bad! Way too much to the point of ugly. Front desk staff Michelle Jackson very curt and rude; advised if we wanted to check in it would cost $25 more as we were 10 MINUTES EARLY?!?!? Advised we could go to the bar or the pool and wait. Not a pleasant person; better in job with no people contact. No desire to drink as bar dark and loud music, so we went out to pool which was quiet but not very appealing; nothing nice or pleasant about the surroundings. I had asked when confirming reservation days earlier that there was a restaurant for breakfast available in hotel and this was simply not true! The bar was the only eating/drinking place available. No room service either! Room was ok but again, artwork over the top and ugly!! I requested a quiet room and the window was right by overhead freeway, and bar below room so no sleep.(even though room on 4th floor)! We went to get coffee in the a.m. and was told only bar was only available place in hotel and closed!! No bistro, café as we had understood. No sleep on Fri eve as bar very loud until we checked out at 0700 hrs!!! One nice lady Allison made special effort to get coffee the 2nd morning and that was in Styrofoam cups but effort was appreciated. All in all the worst hotel experience ever. If the site I booked on had been more honest I would not have booked. So much for technology?!?! At the very least I hope management sees this review and changes website info as well as some staff. My family was in the hotel business many years and this was completely unacceptable on so many levels! Needless to say I will tell all I know about it and won't be staying again. :( :( :(</p><br>BEST KEPT SECRET HOTEL IN LAS VEGAS<p>The Artisan Hotel is an excellent place to stay, I feel they are charging too little for the rooms,
but thats a good thing, the owner isnt taking advantage of people or ripping them off, he is a smart man who understand that if you give people a good deal and a great experience then
you will be a good customer. The mans name is Steve Siegal, and he takes older hotels and
refurbishes them into beautiful resort properties, the Artisan is one of them.

Also check out Rumor hotel( Sister hotel to Artisan ), its across from Hard Rock and its low cost, wonderful, and ts another best kept secret to find some beautiful local women living in Las Vegas. Everytime I goto Rumor or Artisan I find dozens of pretty local women, alot are Cirque performers who want to hang out after work.

I wouldnt recommend older folks to stay here, maybe you want to goto the Wynn, the Artisan
is for fun party people, This is where the Kardashians stay, The Artisan lounge was rated best bar in Las Vegas. This is where the local performers go to party and hang out, There is a nice topless pool with beautiful people walking around, the nice thing is you do not have to be in great shape to fit in, there is a mixture of locals and tourist people around here, even the foreigners have a good time at the Artisan, everyone is cool here,

The rooms are fun and unique, the food is great and they make the best drinks in all of Vegas.

Always go where the locals go if you want the true SIN CITY experience, and the Artisan
is the party spot of Las Vegas.

If you are ready to have a great drink, dance and have fun this is the place!

NOTE: Do not choose Artisan if you are elderly, weak of heart, or have issues with party crowds, this is a Fun Party hotel, it is loud, it gets crazy, and can last all night! - Its all good!</p><br></body></html>
