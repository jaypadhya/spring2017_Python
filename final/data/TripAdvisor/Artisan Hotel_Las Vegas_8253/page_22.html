<html><head><h3>Artisan Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 22</h3></head><body><br>Amazing bang for the buck<p>Ximena n Drake were amazing. The professionalism in handling certain issues went far an beyond expectation. I love the decor. Art hanging not only from every wall n hall way but from the ceiling. However, the professionalism of the staff surpassed any visual lure and I will only stay here from now on and encourage all my friends to do so.
Room Tip: Choose from any of your favorite artist... Frida khalo 420 was great.
See more room tips</p><br>Not Worth the Money<p>I was placed at the Aritsan because their sister property, Rumor, claimed to have had a plumbing issue. First of all, the Artisan is located right off of the 1-15 exit 40 (Sahara) so it is NOT within reasonable walking distance of the strip. There is absolutely nothing around other than industrial businesses and gentlemen's clubs.

The property is kept dimly lit as others have described. The first room I was placed in seemed to have not been stayed in for a month....or they just do not clean well. There was dust on everything and there were tiny bugs crawling in the tub. In addition, the pillow cases were dirty and obviously had not been changed. I was moved to another room which was better - no bugs and less dust. The lobby does turn into an after hours club but being on the 4th floor I was not disturbed by the music. My bathroom did not have a towel rack. The carpet was filthy - looked good but walking from the bed to bathroom in white socks made my socks black! There is basic cable, no movie channels but one adult channel that only showed previews. There is no fitness center, no refrigerator, no microwave and no ice machine. The restaurant is a bit pricey but the food is decent enough.

My major complaint is that, considering I had been displaced from Rumor and placed here, you would think the Artisan would go out of their way to accommodate me. They did not. The discounted rate was quite honestly still too much for what I received. The front desk staff was nice but no consideration for my inconvenience. Not so much as a free beer at the restaurant, complimentary taxi ride to the airport, nothing. After I had complained about my inconveniences, the night manager sent up a complimentary bottle of $5 champagne. Nice thought but not enough.

If you are looking for a place to go with "what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas" this is the place to be. Otherwise, save your money, it is definitely not worth the price!</p><br>resident dj roid rage<p>am a big fan of electronic music so i heard about the artisan when i first moved here. I decided to check it out. it has great art and mirrors on the ceiling. The bartenders are nice and fast and the music is great after 4am. dj's stellar, nadastrom, teen wolf and justin key are probably the best djs i have heard there. They are my top picks for sure. They all have a very different style of playing and music from the rest. stellar has really good trance/rave old school remixes and teen wolf does the whole moonbahtan thing.Justin key plays stuff you dont hear every where else, true underground house music. nadastrom i have only seen there once but he had a great style of music as well. great food except they changed there menu, should have kept the old one
i really enjoy everything about this place but.......I wont be returning

I brought some friends of mine who had flew in from boston, i had been telling them about the artisan, they were amped to go there. Especially since there wasnt a strict dress code and we didnt have to deal with the strip. The night was going well i thought, they were having a good time. We were hanging in the lobby waiting for one of the girls to be done in the restroom., when in the corner of my eye i see someone being thrown out into the lobby. i notice that its one of the djs that was playing earlier who happens to be there resident dj might i add, he was trying to punch and kick this other smaller guy.then there was a thrid guy who tried to pull the resident dj off him becuase he looked like he was going to beat up this small fella. Well big haired dude (resident dj) sorry i forget his name grabs the guy who is trying to pull him off the little fella and slams him down onto the floor and some how came crashing on top of him. as the resident got up he said to the guy on the ground dont you ever touch me or keep your hands off me, cant remember exact words he chose. then security and came over and the crowd got closer becuase this guy was letting out this loud painful moan. I mean he came down hard, i really felt for the guy, citizen trying to do a good deed turns out the worst for him. As we are watching this go down the girls came back from the bathroom and one of them had seen the whole thing and was so upset she didnt want to be there anymore, she was appalled that an employee there resident dj was on a rampage as she called it and trying to beat up everyone, and was still just hanging out in the lobby. So we left that totally ruined our mood and i was embarrassed becuase i hyped this place up to people and said it was a classier type afterhours then drais.She couldnt believe that it was ok for their employees to beat up people. Thats not even the climax, come to find out the guy on the floor was a fellow co worker another resident dj there(justin key) the one i had mentioned earlier. So not only was there big haired dj trying to beat up some guy(not sure who it was) but when another dj who is his coworker or who knows maybe even friend trys to stop him from making a complete mocherey of himself he decides to body slam that guy as well. i cant believe it, i have never seen anything like it, i really hope they fire this dj. If they dont they could have a major lawsuit on there hands if either of those two got substantially hurt. Let alone what does that say about them as a company if they keep him around. I was never a fan of his anyway, he had to big of an ego and he would walk around like he was something special. His actions only proved that he is weak and shouldnt be allowed in that venue. I know me nor my friends will be returning to the artisan, especially if he is still djing there. I mean i saw this first hand with my own eyes, that dj is an animal. who goes around beating up customers and coworkers. I feel bad for the other dj he was injured he couldnt move. that really did it for me, very dissapointing becuase i really liked this venue, but i cant go somewhere that supports this type of violent behaivor</p><br>Great for weekdays and weekends..<p>I've stayed here many trips to vegas and am always impressed with the atmosphere and customer service. Everyone that works at the hotel is friendly and eager to make sure you have a nice stay. While its's true that the nightclub downstairs can get a little loud on the weekends if you're looking to have a fun Vegas experience it can make your stay quite exciting and could be reason enough to stay at this hotel. Alternatively, if you're looking for a more low-key experience the hotel is quiet and inviting during teh week and a great option for wanting to experience a quaint and charming boutique hotel experience in Las Vegas.

One significant advantage of this hotel that it's not a casino hotel. It is extremely easy to get in and out of the hotel with no parking structure to drive around or 10 minute walks through a loud casino floor. Thanks to a free and efficient valet available 24 hours you can be resting comfortably in your room five minutes after you get out of your car. This is particularly convenient for those in town on business or those wanting to explore all the city has to offer without spending have your trip going back and forth between a parked car and your hotel room.

Late night weekends can be a little crowded downstairs with people enjoying the nightlife scene but hotel staff always do a good job of making certain hotel guests can get in and out of the hotel easily. I would agree with other reviewers and the hotel staff comments the if you don't like music and excitement and a very late night party scene then this hotel during the weekends maybes isn't for you -- but if are young and looking for an exciting weekend in Vegas then you should definitely consider a stay at The Artisan.

Finally, the restaurant downstairs is a nice option if you want to grab a bite. Prices are reasonable and they happily serve you in the very cool lounge if you are in the mood for people watching, outside in a nice patio area of you want nice Vegas weather or by the pool if you want to enjoy both.

Overall this biggest asset of this hotel is the great service and the mellow, relaxed atmosphere of the hotel during the week along with the option to visit (or stay) for the weekend and enjoy some crazy Vegas nightlife built right in to the lobby/bar/club of where you are staying.

Before I paid in advance and made my reservation I called the online reservation service that starts with "O" and confirmed that there was no resort fee. The operator confirmed that I was right that no resort fee was disclosed on the material. Guess what. As I was checking out I noticed a hard to read black text on red background board saying there was a resort fee of $9.95 per day. I objected and the desk clerk said he would take care of it. I will know if I was charged when I get my credit card bill.
Room Tip: Call any hotel in Nevada to confirm presence of resort fees and surcharges for things like wifi. Don...

I will make to sure to visit the Artisan every time I go to Vegas which about 3-4 a year. The After Hours is amazing. I love losing track of time walking out to the patio and seeing the sun come up. The drinks are always great and the bartenders are on top of it. The only bad thing I can say is that if you don't have a room there be prepared to wait in a very long line for the bathroom if you're partying it up at night there. The decor is excellent and fun. The rooms are beautifully decorated and comfortable. Can't wait to come back, I'm planning my next Vegas adventure right now!</p><br>don't plan on sleeping here<p>noisy! if the night club doesn't keep you up the cars racing on a street nearby will. the room wasnt vacuumed and the bathroom tile was dirty looking. lobby was pretty. but dark and kinda eerie like the haunted house/twilight zone at disneyland kinda feel. Found out once i showed up that it is zoned right in the middle of a bunch of strip clubs. if i would have known the area was that trashy i would have never booked it! front desk people were nice, and tried to be accommodating. but unless you are a partier i'd find somewhere else.
Room Tip: if you have to stay there make sure your room is on a high floor and away from street traffic. Bring...
See more room tips</p><br>Never Again<p>The moment I pulled up to the hotel, I knew I was in trouble. There was a mob of people standing around the front door with blaring music coming from the dark lobby. Getting off of a plane straight into a club scene is definitely not what I expected.

The front desk person was nice. The decor was interesting. The room was interesting also.

I stayed there until 5:00am that following morning thinking I could get some sleep. I couldn't take the loud blaring music and bass that engulfed my room on the FOURTH FLOOR. I don't see how people sleep there. If you are planning to stay for business, don't do it. If you planning to stay to club until the wee hours of the morning and still get no sleep, Artisan is your hotel.</p><br>only a place to party, totally disappointed!!!<p>I was extremely disappointed with my recent stay at the artisan. I think the lobby is gorgeous and the hotel has potential. It reminds me of an old speakeasy. However, the bar tender in the morning couldn't put a smile on her face and was just out right rude. They need a mixologist behind the bar who actually likes their job and more hired help working. The front desk was very nice, the breakfast was great. But be cautious of your room. They may stick you above the "after-hours" bar where you will not sleep. We were told this so we asked for a room furthest away from the club. They say it's a non-smoking hotel, however the rooms reeked of stale cigarettes and their were burn marks on the furniture. The bed was comfortable which was about the only thing that was nice. From 2:00-8:00 am there were people partying out in the alley way. I had ear plugs and I was up every hour! It was awful!!! There needs to be a security guard getting rid of people lurking about. We heard cars racing, reving their engines, and blasting music right under our window and we were 5 stories up. I was extremely disappointed. DOn't stay here. Just grab a drink at night from the bar and check out the decor.
Room Tip: stay furthest away from the after-hours club
See more room tips</p><br>Where 6th Graders Come to Party<p>I am writing this review while actually lying in bed at the Artisan, during ANOTHER sleepless night. Nascar earplugs and ambian might be a limitation here, stopping you from hearing your car alarm go off(along with every one else's) and from heading downstairs when someone pulls the fire alarm (which sounds like the car alarms, only longer) and no one answers the front desk phone. I don't know if the LVFD just has a really long response time or if they have just come to the Artisan so many times that they just ignore the alarms. I have spent much of the night feeling sorry for the 2 dogs down the hall, as they have been freaked out from the noise, alarms, and doors banging. If only I could howl too...
Yes, we were warned. We read the other reviews and that's why I called the hotel and talked to them before we booked. They told us they were reserving us a "special" room that we would be satisfied with. WHY NOT JUST TELL US THAT THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A QUIET ROOM AT THE ARTISAN AND LET US GO SOMEWHERE ELSE!?
Are people horrible here? No. Everyone is friendly, but unless you live a vampire life and only sleep during the day, this is not where you want to be.
Room Tip: There is no such thing as a good room at the Artisan!
