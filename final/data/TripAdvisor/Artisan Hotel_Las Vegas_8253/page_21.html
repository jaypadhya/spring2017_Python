<html><head><h3>Artisan Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 21</h3></head><body><br>Cool Hotel<p>We have stayed at about every hotel in Las Vegas over the years large and small and this has to be one of our favorites! It is very diffrent than the strip hotels it reminds us of the boutique hotels in Miami South beach. The decor is super cool and the lighting is very dim to set the mood and the topless pool is a great place to hang out all day and the bar/club is fun and busy at night and yes on the weekends the party does go on all night long. Even though we are older we still managed to dance the night away. We would also like to thank Drake at the front desk for being so helpfull and imformative. He was the most helpful person we dealt with on our trip to Las Vegas ! We will be back next year!</p><br>Not a place for those wo dont party..<p>The staff was out standing . Its not a place i would go back to on a fri or sat night. The hotel has a live dj on the weekend which is fine if your into that life style.Sunday-Thur its a great place to stay</p><br>Great Adult Fun in Vegas<p>First of all - DO NOT bring your kids or your grandmother here, people!! It's clearly denoted as 21+! That said, we absolutely loved the place! We stayed there last October and were so surprised. As other have said, it's goth and dark in a sexy way and the staff was really fun and accommodating. We spent almost every day at the Naked pool. In the mornings, it was laid back and we were almost naked all the time. They say it's topless but we were nude until after noon and even then, we both wore as little as possible ;) The pool hostess and the djs were fun-loving but not intrusive. The music as was a little loud but not overpowering. Most of the female clientele at the pool took off the tops which made it fun and reduced the uncomfortable factor. I have been to most of the European style pools in Vegas and like this one the best. Also, loved the the little beach balls!!
The rooms were nice and comfortable. We were only in them to sleep at night though as we did lots of exploring. We liked the porn channel on the tv but, gosh, Artisan staff, please play more than one movie!!!! Heck, I'll bring you some to put in the DVD player!
We loved the sexy artwork on the walls all over the hotel. Lots of nudes. One night after we had been out drinking, we just strolled the halls looking at all the art. Even took some sexy pix of our own with the artwork!
One word of warning, the bar really is open all night and it's pretty loud. So, plan to be up all night or get drunk enough that you can sleep through the music that goes until dawn!
All in all, we loved the Artisan! It's off the strip and a bit isolated so getting anywhere else plan to walk (we did this every day and it's fun but hot!) or take a cab or car. It's not the swanky, 5-star resorts that Vegas is known for but it's sexy and fun and inexpensive and the staff does their best to cater to every need of the ADULT guests. My advice, if you want a less-expensive Vegas trip with all the fun and sexiness, bring your partner to the Artisan and go crazy!
Room Tip: If you want a good night's sleep, stay on the top floor opposite the lounge.

First of all we had a Complimentary breakfast (which was great) but we made the mistake of ordering coffee, it was $5 for a cup of coffee!!! Usually that wouldn't bother me but the coffee was DISGUSTING..cold..stale etc, and none of us drank more than 2 sips!! When we spoke to the manager about it he basically said "I DON'T CARE, WE HAVE TO MAKE MONEY" I was in shock at the lack of compassion and rudeness. Considering we are staying at a hotel that is worse than Circus Circus you would think they would be more accommodating so they can keep the few guests they have. Then while my friend is taking a shower the ceiling starts leaking, and not just water but some brown stuff. We called downstairs and they had someone up immediately he told us that there were two guests upstairs taking a shower together!! You could imagine our disgust! We called downstairs bc we wanted another room they told us "NO, WE ARE BOOKED" but the funny thing is there were 5 rooms on our floor that were empty our entire stay! The maintenance man fixed the leak but not before I saw MOLD!!!!! Normally I would have ran out the room and never turned back, but my friends reminded me that if they weren't gonna give us our $5 back for our disgusting coffee, did I think they would give us money back for our stay?? Bottom line is this hotel in my eyes is a 1 or 2 star and the service is exactly that, but the price was the same as some of the hotels on the strip so we should have just stayed at one of those hotels. I will NEVER EVER stay here again and I will continue to discourage anybody else from staying there.
Room Tip: Avoid staying here!

This place is so dark I could barely see where I was going in the lobby when I walked in. The rooms are the same way. Decorated very dark - everything is black. My guess is that it is to hide all the dirty and gosh only knows what goes on at this hotel during the weekend. The pool water was grey! And the service was horrible. A maintenance man just tried to come right into my room without knocking at all. Thank gosh I had my sliding lock on! The front desk wouldn't call a cab for me although they weren't busy at all. I had to come down and have the valet do it. And the service in the bar is very bad. The bartender was more interested in her phone then the clients.</p><br>A unique experience<p>I am a little late in writing this as I stayed here on St Patricks Day weekend but I wanted to share. This was my first trip to Las Vegas but my boyfriend had been several times and wanted a different experience from what you get at a gaming hotel. Our first impression of the Artisan was "WOW!". The decor of this place is really interesting. Reproduction prints of amazing artwork all over, cool sculptures, dark woods and gothic chairs... It suited my tastes well. The staff at the hotel was courteous and helpful. I especially liked the valet employees because I ended up seeing them the most since I was a smoker in a non-smoking hotel.

I had read reviews on the hotel prior to my stay and was prepared for a terribly loud weekend but actually, the room we were in on the 3rd floor really wasn't as noisey as I had expected. I didn't need earplugs or a pillow over my head to get some sleep. I am not a club goer so I didn't participate in the late night partying of the downstairs but if that's your scene, everyone looked to be having a terribly good time upon walking through on my way to get some old lady sleep.

The only downfall to the Artisan is it's out of the way location. If you're driving in Vegas, it's a great choice but if you are cabbing around the city, you're going to have to set aside a good amount of cash for fare to and from.
Room Tip: Stay on a higher floor to decrease party noise.

The entire boutiquey hotel has a unique, Gothic by way of Lynch vibe, with artwork crammed everywhere you can see, distinct and cool rooms, an excellent restaurant, and one of the best bars in town. I'm a total convert and will be staying there again for sure.</p><br>They made my wedding special<p>Well I said I would let you all know how our wedding went.
Amazing is all I can say.
We had our ceremony in the church at the Artisan at 3pm we decorated it ourselves that morning and also decorated the mood restaurant that morning. We had met with Chris the hospitality manager and Amberly the event Manager and both were so helpful. I am an event planner in Ireland and knew what I wanted and that is exactly what I got. We had 31 guests at the wedding and everyone had a great time. We hired a singer and guitar player Frm LA called Tini Grey he was amazing and fitted into the venue very well. The Venue is perfect for pictures with so many options. The patio is fantastic for the Coctail hour. Thank you to all the fantastic professional staff who really looked after us all. Sarah & Martin 14th May Wedding xx</p><br>awesome party spot<p>Wouldn't necessarily look to stay here for peace and quiet on the weekends, but what a great place to stay if you are into good music and a diverse crowd. My next trip I'm considering splitting my time between here and the strip for the late night scene alone. Drinks are expensive but that is Vegas all around. Keep up the good work, I'll be back soon!</p><br>Very recent and honest review-April 2012<p>This is an honest review. I am 32. My brother who lives in Vegas recommended this place. 7 of us came out to visit and stayed at the Artisan. Swanky, boutique style. No gambling. 5-6 floors with a nice little pool with 4 cabanas and nice large lounge beds around the pool.. DJ spinning at the pool on Saturday afternoon. Awesome decor. Very cool vibe at the hotel. The staff was wonderful. Very accommodating and friendly. Lindsay and Harper at the inside bar were great. Deborah was super nice outside at the patio bar. Drake at the front desk and Jordan out at the pool were also great. This place is like a nightclub with 5 floors of hotel rooms. From about midnight to 4/5 AM on the weekends the place goes crazy. Locals and visitors. About $20 cab to the strip. No gift shop in the hotel so come prepared. 7-11 is a 15 min walk. Not too loud to sleep. Not for families. I will stay there again for sure. Loved it.
Room Tip: We were on the 3rd floor. No problems. Not too loud to sleep; it's Vegas. You shouldn't be g...
