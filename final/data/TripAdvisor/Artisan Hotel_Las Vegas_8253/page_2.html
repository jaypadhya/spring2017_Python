<html><head><h3>Artisan Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 2</h3></head><body><br>Great place for having fun (no kids)<p>This is a great place to go if you want some place to go that is very "adult". The pool is topless and they have music playing all night long in a club like atmosphere. Fun place to go if you want to hang out with sexy people.</p><br>Absolutely brilliant boutique hotel<p>Highly highly highly recommend the Artisan! Getting away from the over-inflated prices on the strip and being able to relax by the pool was fantastic. Definitely caters to the adult guest..top notch staff and service. Without a doubt the atmosphere and decor are best in Vegas. Its become my favorite place to stay whenever Im in town. Its stylish....its fun..and its affordable. Love it!!!</p><br>Great but....<p>Always love staying at the Artisan, love the atmosphere and decor. The pool was a lot of fun, never done a topless pool even though we live in Vegas. Rooms could use some updating, mainly TLC stuff. Nightclub although fun was very empty.</p><br>Artisan Hotel was awesome<p>I like all the vintage decor all over the hotel I would definitely stay again .One because is Kool and the other most important reason is because I could take my best friend Tioky and it was worth the trip to know he didn't stay behind. :)</p><br>broken shower head<p>Everything was fine except the broken shower head. Had water all over the place after taking a shower. I let front desk know as I checked out so hopefully it is fixed. Other than that everything else was good.</p><br>Unique place to stay<p>Unique place to stay. Artwork decor is incredible. Service was accommodating. Can't beat the price. Bar and patio is great atmosphere. I would recommend the upgraded room, it is worth the price. Didn't use pool but will next time!
Room Tip: Pay extra for upgraded rooms

In total we had no smoke detector, furniture falling away from the wall, broken mirror, broken security lock, broken shower head, stained bedding, missing wall decor and a thermostat hanging out of the wall by its wires.</p><br>Awesome staycation for johnsons<p>Awesome room... enjoyed atmosphere.. girls, room was great. Enjoyed pool.. could be cleaner.. bar tender Lindsey is awesome ..great place to stay.
Really fun.. always love valets.. chris.. cute guys..</p><br>We took an hour nap and decided to checkout of this creepy hotel.<p>Location is awful.
To start off this place has a terrible location. It's a few miles off the strip and in the middle of nowhere. We are very familiar with the Las Vegas area and we went around a few times just to find this place.

Poor service.
We took an unexpected last minute trip to Vegas and it being Labor Day weekend we couldn't book anywhere else but here. When we arrived we couldn't find where we where supposed to park so we found a spot and left it there just meanwhile we went to the front desk to ask but immediately someone came very rudely asking for us to move our car. He said it was strictly valet but no one was there when we arrived and he was very rude about it. Also once we were checking in the girl was obviously very annoyed and had poor customer service. She never smiled or made eye contact. Then she tells us it's a party hotel. With a DJ playing 10-6am and I wish it would have said that somewhere before booking. We were just trying to find a place to rest before our drive. Also everyone checking in were older people like in their late 40's. The whole vibe about the place was so off to me. It just didn't seem like Vegas.

The hotel decor was tasteless.
The entrance is okay but as soon as I got into the elevator it was very creepy and smelly. There are hundreds of random frames all over. The place is very dark and it gives a claustrophobic feel. Once you enter the room it gets even worse. It smelled old and it was dark and small. Then I open the window for some light just to see a dirty rooftop and the freeway next to us. I'm sorry but it's been the worst place I stayed. Maybe it just wasn't for me but I wouldn't recommend it. We only took an hour nap and decided we weren't staying and checked out.</p><br>Great place to stay<p>Very accommodating and friendly staff. I have stayed here almost every week for the last couple of years. I am always amazed at how everyone I come into contact with are on it. The bar and club have interesting people that makes the stay better.</p><br></body></html>
