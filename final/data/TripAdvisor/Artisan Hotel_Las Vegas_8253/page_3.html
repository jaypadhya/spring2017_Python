<html><head><h3>Artisan Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 3</h3></head><body><br>Ridiculous<p>This was our wedding night. Had no forewarning that this was a "party" hotel, music from the pool area went on until 5am. Started my period, small amount of blood on sheets, that they probably washed and reused. They charged me $250 in "room damages". As a local, many friends in hotel industry stated this was ridiculous, there was not damage, and it was clearly unintentional</p><br>good price, poor location<p>I was driving a rental and not planning to drink, so the location was OK for me. But if you plan to party, you'll need to cab from here. I also was there mid-week, so it was pretty quiet. Apparently on the weeken it is a party place though.</p><br>Frightening Place! Slept sitting up.<p>Booked this hotel due to lack of availability for other know hotels. Hard to find when getting off of the Freeway. Entrance is stunning but once you go beyond the front door it turns into a scene from a horror movie. Decor is pitch black, almost mid-evil despite the bones of the lobby being beautiful. I arrived after a long work day and drive through the desert from Arizona. Did not stop for dinner assuming that I could eat at the hotel restaurant. Informed that it was under renovation/closed and was told to go to several near restaurants in walking distance? Really walking in Las Vegas off the strip alone? Then was handed a take out menu and told they would have the delivery man bring directly to my room. NO THANKS. As a woman traveling alone, not the best option. There was an antique cabinet with a full shelf of assorted condoms and other related items. The next shelf had bags of snacks and chewing gum. Not exactly the way to greet you at check in. I was informed that there would be a "security deposit" hold on my credit card that would clear in several days-I guess a damage deposit? Proceeded to my room which had updated finishes but done poorly. Huge hole in floor at the foot of the bed where they attempted to hide by installing very plush carpet instead of repairing the floor! Amenities in the room were sub-standard. No hair dryer in the room, called to desk and had to get dressed and go down to pick up myself, never was delivered. Environment a bit unsettling definately not business friendly. I was only there for several hours and flew out at 6am the next morning. Not worth the money, a bit seedy and unsavory clientele.
Room Tip: Pick a different hotel! Not convenient to the Strip
See more room tips</p><br>Artisan Stay<p>Friendly staff. Place falling apart. Water leak in room. Missing wall fixtures. Holes, chipped/missing paint. Tub clogged/slow drain - gross. Flooring in hall way bumpy and filthy. Hotel pool seemed out of order because of its filth. No on property dining.</p><br>Liars. Piss poor liars<p>Hotel guests must pay for electricity. We hade to pay 57 dollars for 4 days. A key card must be placed in a scanner in order to access electricity. There is no restaurant or food service of any kind, even though it is clearly advertised on the website. Upon entering the room, a rude letter from the General Manager awaits guests. This letter explains why his hotel had no food service. Don't get too cozy at the pool, because even paying guests are kicked out if they didn't pay the 100 dollars to be at the pool party. Also they do Latin parties a couple nights a week, blasting awful accordion filled music at the moon into the wee hours of the morning.</p><br>Great stay, almost perfect<p>This is a party hotel. Not for anything else really, great value for what you get. Needs some renovations to the room. The pool is couples only. Book through their website for free champagne. I would stay here again if it's a party trip.</p><br>Don't stay here.<p>I spent most of my time in the room. If you are going to be out partying the whole time it's probably not bad. But for me, it was terrible. No fridge, microwave, restaurant, no parking, bad tv. Far away from everything that you can't just walk around. LOUD club until 5am. I was interested in the strange decor but was very disappointed in the room.</p><br>Awesome Experience!!!<p>We stayed labor day weekend. The hotel was not to crowded. All the staff were very friendly. We came to party and were not disappointed. The lobby and pool area were just as advertised, very cool and sexy. The rooms are better than what you would expect at this price. The bathroom sparkled, room art was really cool and some small things could have used a little TLC . Very attractive crowd at the pool parties with great music. We will definitely stay again!!!</p><br>UNSATISFACTORY<p>This is a great hotel. I loved everything about it. Pictures everywhere. It's dark everywhere,.. But eyes adjust. Front desk clerk was very friendly and helpful. And I loved the pool. Small, but nice. Was quiet for weekday. Will definitely come back.
