<html><head><h3>Courtyard Las Vegas Convention Center Hotel Reviews Page 8</h3></head><body><br>Mid Life Crisis<p>Blessed with a location that is mid way between the south and north stations of the Monorail you will be well served by staying at this Marriott. It's old school in some ways but I found it completely acceptable. First of all the parking is free! Gotta love that. Secondly, the desk people are fantastic: Ruby is a charmer. She makes your stay 100% better just because she excels at customer service. Corinne is young and filled with potential and absolutely warmed me with her personality and thoughtfulness. The hotel is not for everyone but if you want an non casino hotel give it a try. Message to management: remember the details and look closely at your bathrooms. A little TLC would mean a lot.</p><br>Good Spot<p>Stopped quickly in Vegas and stayed here. Great hotel and great location. Very up to date and modern. Of course, Vegas has everything to offer. This hotel is right in the middle of it all. Close to the strip and everything else for that matter. Great service, great staff, great amenities. I didn't personally eat at the restaurant there, but others in my party did and loved it. This hotel provided the perfect stopover for us. Hotel has parking on site that worked great. Our room had a great night time view of the strip to see the bright lights of the big city. The view was awesome, but not disruptive when we wanted to sleep.
Room Tip: We paid the little extra for the "Strip View" which was exactly that, a great view of the...

It is conveniently close to most of the downtown/strip area, reasonable rates and friendly, helpful staff... recently renovated - at least the carpet, walls, beds and furniture - but could still use some more attention to details - otherwise good to go... ask for an inner courtyard room for quietness - or at least one on the north side - the south side is next to Desert Inn Rd which is very busy and noisy... NOTE: obviously a great place to stay if you are attending a trade show at the Convention Center but good luck getting a reservation - you're not the first person to think of this location.
Room Tip: Free wifi if you are a Gold member, otherwise no.

Rooms are efficient and nothing much to say about except air condition is LOUD ! Luckily Vegas nights are cool in october and I could do without.
Apart from that, no surprise good or bad. I would return for a business trip.</p><br>Great location, comfortable bed.<p>The bed and location were really the only noteworthy things about this place. The bed was heavenly after traveling. The location is great and close to the monorail which is an excellent alternative to the cabs. The door to the balcony was very dated and loud. It could hardly be budged without some serious elbow grease behind it. The room was clean but the furniture seemed dated. The staff was friendly but not forthcoming with much information. Check in was extremely easy and got the rewards but the lady upon check out seemed a bit frazzled as she was the only one working the desk. There is a much better value up the street which is another Marriott hotel.</p><br>Overall just fine.<p>I only stayed two nights I was visiting a relative so I only used it to sleep. Beds were comfortable pool was alright and they had icecream and snacks in the main office for a late night craving. Right across the street from convention center.</p><br>Perfect Location For Exhibiters<p>Great Location, Extremely Friendly and Accommodating Staff, Clean Rooms, Quiet, Good Breakfast and Dinner Accommodations on site.

Great Lounging Area in lobby, eat, drink, work, socialize in comfort

Quick Access to Tram
Room Tip: Stay on the 1st floor if you'd like to use the gym, pool or outdoor seating area.

I have stayed at this Courtyard many times when I am working in Vegas and the front desk experience hasn't always been the best. Until last night! This is the first time I had dealt with Thea and she was awesome! Made me feel very welcome. I hope she is working during my next visit!</p><br>Perfect place for convention stay<p>This was the perfect place to stay for my convention. I will definitely be back. Loved the Bistro for breakfast and Dinner! Every employee was kind, courteous and helpful. Very clean, comfortable room
Room Tip: Noise in the hallway was very minimal. Felt like the only person staying there. My room faced a busy...
See more room tips</p><br>The place to stay for conventions<p>Loved the location. If you have to add up the money(taxi's or monorail) and time(walking or waiting for transportation to and from) to get to a convention you will spend so much more than the price of the hotel room here. We had time between speakers at lunch time to walk back and drop off stuff. Employees all seemed very personable and helpful. Rooms very clean and I enjoyed the Bistro style restaurant in the lobby. Price point good on the food, and a nice variety to get yourself going. Couple downfalls for me: Being from Seattle, the room coffee tasted and looked like dirty water. The room was hot and stuffy when we entered because the air conditioner wouldn't go below a certain degree and the fan on it seemed very tired. I know this property has no control over their reservation system, but I called direct to check availability, they would not take or make my reservation. They transferred me to India(or were ever) their reservation system is located, which the agent couldn't seemed to get anything correct from my name, email, or correct place to stay(5 properties on Paradise Road does present a problem if you don't know exact property you want to stay) etc. Corporate take note: You have a great thing going on with properties, but you get downgraded because the reservation system</p><br></body></html>
