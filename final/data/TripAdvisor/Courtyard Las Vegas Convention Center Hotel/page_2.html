<html><head><h3>Courtyard Las Vegas Convention Center Hotel Reviews Page 2</h3></head><body><br>Vets in Vegas<p>Booked a room over the Labor Day weekend while I was in town for an informal Somalia Vets get together. The room was nice. Very comfortable bed. Internet had issues, so I used my phone as a hotspot which resolved the issues. Room has a sitting area which was perfect for visiting. There is no room service, but the hotel has a "diner" that was convenient for breakfast and dinner. Breakfast is not free. The pool was very clean, and warm. Easy access to the pool, gym and laundry facilities. The hotel sits directly across the street from the monorail station. We used that instead of a cab and saved a lot. This place is off the strip and the noise level was very low, except for the helicopter tours that fly directly above the area. Couldn't hear it in the room. I'd stay there again.</p><br>Great Hotel!<p>Love this hotel. Normally my company puts me at a different Residence Inn which is currently under renovation so we have been moved. I was very sad to hear this, however on arrival I was happily surprised. The staff is great and welcoming. The hotel is very clean, warm and inviting. The rooms are spacious, quiet and comfortable.

The pool is very small, but I think this is more of a business hotel and have never seen more then 1 other person out there when I have been there. I believe the hotel will allow you to use the pool at the Marriott Residence Inn next door as well though.

There are not a whole lot of food options within walking distance and the cafe in the hotel is open minimal hours, but I walk to the strip normally in about 15 minutes so get my steps in before I eat all of the calories!

I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a nice place to stay off the strip.</p><br>Convenient &amp; Great Priced<p>This hotel was great! very convenient to the strip via the Monorail directly across the street (24 hour Monorail pass was only $12). The Monorail dropped us off at all the big name hotel/casinos on the strip! Cab ride from the airport was not bad because it is only about 10 minutes from the airport. Definitely worth staying here!</p><br>Location<p>You cannot beat free parking and being directly across from the monorail, as well as great customer service and hospitality which is the reason for my rating. When it comes to the rooms, we were facing the highway which was quite noisy but we don't mind and we aren't major complainers, but for some this could be a big problem. Also, there was nothing major that I could VISIBLY see that was wrong or unclean about my room, however I think housekeeping could have a greater attention to detail. Someone's old Bobby pins were left on our bathroom sink and there was still soap residue on the soap holder along with a piece of long hair on one of our towels which made me wonder what else may have been overlooked. Had I reported this, I'm sure it would have been address but we did not want to hang around and wait for someone to come and we don't like our room being entered while we are away.

The woman who checked us in was extremely kind and hospitable, no one else really stood out but staff was friendly overall.</p><br>Long walk to strip if you like walking<p>We checked in and proceeded up to our room. Upon entering daughter noticed something crawling on one of the pillows. Although it probably was harmless we went back down to check in and she could tell something was wrong. Daughter explained what was going on and she immediately changed our room.

The 2nd room was clean although I did find a dead bug on my pillow this time. Nothing worth running down to the front desk about. I do think housekeeping has a issue though as we were showering the bathtub was filling up with water and was up to my mid calf by the time I was done showering. Daughter also had the same problem. Why doesn't housekeeping report this to maintenance if its not their job to clean the drain out? Yes, we did report it upon check out. We were also short for bath towels so we called the front desk for additional ones and just happened to mention to the gentleman who brought the towels that our TV wasn't working even after we got new batteries in the remote. He said he was pretty sure what the problem was and he was right. He said when housekeeping cleans the TV area they pull the TV out and pulls the plugs out of the TV. He plugged them back in tight and TV worked.

There was a small refrigerator in room and 2 counters. There is a pool however we did not check it out.

We walked up to Las Vegas Blvd to see my sister in law and didn't realize it was a long walk in the hot weather up to the strip. We were seriously thinking of catching a taxi back because we had walked so far in the hot weather. When we arrived back at the hotel we found out there was a monorail right across the street from the hotel. I guess we were so excited to get to the strip that we didn't even see the monorail.

We had to leave real early so don't know if there was any breakfast.</p><br>Just what I needed<p>Was easy to get to by bus and the monorail to the strip is right across the road which was very convenient. Thea at reception was very helpful and answered all of my questions. The bistro Was very nice too and reasonably priced. The bed was extremely comfortable and the room very clean.</p><br>Clean and Friendly<p>This was my first visit to Magic and we stayed close at this location. The staff is friendly, the location was constantly being cleaned. Assistant GM Chris Jones was informative and pleasant. I'd like to thank Amairany, Heather, Amy, Thea, Ruby, Wanda, Jokelyne, Jose and our cleaning staff for making our stay perfect. If we needed anything, they stepped up. I'd stay there again. Maybe February!</p><br>Away from the strip<p>So we chose this hotel because wanted to get some rest after away from the strip after a night out in the strip itself.
It was quiet enough to get a couple of good sleep hours. Not a top notch one, but it was not what we were looking for anyway.
Room was clean and staff was courteous.
This is a good option if you don't mind spending about $30 to get to the strip in a cab.
Room Tip: Away from any noisy area... they'll accommodate you

I greatly appreciate that you are a quick walk to the strip but your hotel is not in and among the chaos. You can even take the tram to the strip if walking is not your thing. It is right across the street. I prefer going in for the fun then coming back to the quiet, comfort and lack of crowds. My new favorite hotel in Vegas</p><br>Great value. Great location.<p>Easy check-in. Upbeat, smiling staff. Very comfy mattress. Nice clean, modern feel to the lobby and dining area. Perfectly located across the street from monorail station (yes, it's just 2 minutes, if you catch the crosswalk light). Staff really made me feel welcome to be there. I love their set-up for drinks, supplies and snacks. Secured a great price for a busy weekend. Would stay here again for sure.</p><br></body></html>
