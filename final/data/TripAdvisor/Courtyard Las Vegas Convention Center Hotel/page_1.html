<html><head><h3>Courtyard Las Vegas Convention Center Hotel Reviews Page 1</h3></head><body><br>Gated Parking lot<p>Good clean room.
The swimming pool is surrounded by the hotel (in the middle of the hotel), so people from the street can't see our activity
Jose, the guy in the front desk was very helpful. He asked me do I have preference room, and I said no.
So he gave me room on the first floor near the door. I can park my car right in front of my room. Very helpful to loading / unloading my luggage.
The cleaning service also amazing. The 3'rd day (Nov 28,2015) they left clean towels, soaps, and shampoo in front of my door. I don't like people to enter my room, so I put don't disturb sign.
Most of all, the parking lot is gated system. Very easy to get parking spot since only guest can park.
Just by crossing the Paradise st, I can reach the monorail station.</p><br>Exceeds expectations<p>We are in town because my sister has been in "Valley Hospital ( 10 min. drive) since 10/27/15. We need our nights to recharge after Debs,needs during the days. This Hotel has been just what we need,Clean,comfortable beds and room!
The SEMA show is ongoing now but,we've been able to book a room as required. I have made 2 round trips (5hr) home to restock what we need, while my wife remained at my sisters bedside. The staff has been superb! Making sure we have a room even though their very busy w/ SEMA guests. I would certainly stay here for pleasure! In the future.
Room Tip: Ask for courtyard room,not parking lot side

Food at their caf√© was very good. Convenient to use monorail, station was just across the road.</p><br>Exceptional service<p>I stayed at this property for three nights and from the time I checked in to the time I checked out the staff was exceptional. Thea was my main point of contact throughout and she is probably the most courteous, helpful and assertive Marriot staff member that I have ever had staying at a Marriott property. From her friendly smile to her proactive thinking she made my stay really enjoyable. The rest of my team stayed at the Bellagio but I chose to stay at the Marriott as I am a loyalist and I am so glad that I did given service I was provided.</p><br>Regular Hotel<p>We had somewhat of a last minute Las Vegas plan last weekend, therefore we had no choice but to be at this hotel to save some money or else paying over $700 per night at the strip. To start with, the location is good if you are visiting LV to attend a convention at the convention center only. But if you are at LV for pleasure, I suggest looking for a hotel that is very close to the strip. With that said, the location of this hotel in any map is somewhat misleading. It is not advisable to walk outside going to the strip since the area is questionable especially at night. You may have to wait for a taxi to pass by the hotel (in fact the hotel has a Taxi color coded "wait meter" at the lobby indicating how long they expect a taxi to pass by). If you are driving, you have to go around & enter at the main entrance (I suggest that you drive when you're staying at this hotel).
The hotel is a typical Marriott Courtyard with no slot machines and somewhat peaceful (can be a subjective view since one tend to expect slot machines in LV. But then again, peaceful can also be nice).
The staff were nice and greeted you (although some were not in a sincere way, but at least they still greeted you). Our room was simple with the basic stuff. I give the empty fridge a plus since you can stack up on your food & drinks (compared to the large hotels at the strip wherein they have a fridge but can't use it unless you take their items & get charged). The only negative side for me was that our coffee maker was not woking & I forgot to inform the hotel about it since we were always in a hurry (ehem, room 214).
Overall, its really difficult to rate this hotel against the other LV hotels since its like comparing apples to oranges. So if you want to experience a real LV hotel, get a hotel at the strip with the fancy outdoor theme & slot machines. However if you just want a regular hotel for you to stay, this may be a place for you. I just recommend that you drive your own vehicle for convenience. You can try the monorail but its destinations are limited & actually expensive ($5 for 1 way per person?) - might as well use a ride sharing company or taxi & share the expenses if you are with a group.</p><br>Enjoyed stay<p>I stayed there a few nights was like home away from home very clean rooms staff is great!!!! Thea is a great girl goes the extra mile to make sure your stay is great, I really enjoyed her kindness and and help keep up the good work!!!! I will be staying there again soon</p><br>Solid Courtyard Experience<p>I stay at Courtyard's frequently for business travel and was looking for something quite off of The Strip. This Courtyard was exactly as expected; no slot machines, no crazy 20-something parties, pleasant pool/courtyard. It was a reasonable walk to The Strip and the monorail had a stop directly across the street.</p><br>Yet another great stay !<p>This was my second stay at the hotel and I intend to stay here again. It's a great location, right across the street from the convention center, very quiet and without any of the strip noise ! Clean and comfortable rooms, spacious lobby and relaxing courtyard area by the pool. The staff is very friendly and obliging. Once again, special thanks to Thea and Heather.</p><br>Great location<p>If you are looking for a great location away from the traffic problems on the Las Vegas Strip try this courtyard by Marriott location. Easy access from the I15 freeway and best is across the street is the LV monorail system. Ample parking. Rooms are large and comfortable. No fee breakfast. In house dining but nothing special so look into other places to eat in the area.</p><br>Great Staff, Great Stay<p>I attended a conference at the convention center and stayed at the Courtyard Marriott across the street. Our room was very clean. The bed was comfortable. We are at the Bistro and had fabulous food. The Bistro made it convenient to have meals without having to order out or walk/drive somewhere to eat. The staff at the front desk and at The Bistro were all great, friendly and eager to help. I highly recommend them.</p><br></body></html>
