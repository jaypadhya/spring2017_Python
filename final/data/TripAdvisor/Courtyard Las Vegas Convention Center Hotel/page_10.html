<html><head><h3>Courtyard Las Vegas Convention Center Hotel Reviews Page 10</h3></head><body><br>A Little Oasis in LV<p>Away from the Strip and across from the Las Vegas Convention Center, this tranquil Courtyard is an oasis of restfulness in the midst of the crazy that is LV. No neon, no gaming, no nightlife - just the reliable Courtyard experience with a friendly, helpful staff, comfortable rooms, and well-maintained courtyard/pool area. At my request, Leah moved me from a first floor poolside room to 2nd floor overlooking the pool (nothing wrong with the first room, I just wanted to be a little farther from the traffic). Rooms feature good-size balconies (patios on 1st floor) and minifridges, along with the typical Courtyard features including a very comfortable bed and large workdesk and TV. Rooms are relatively large too, plenty of room to spread out and relax or work. The slick LV monorail is across the street, so the Strip is just a few minutes away. I have no complaints at all, though I wish the property had a spa/hot tub (signage indicated one but there was only the swimming pool).. I don't really hope to ever return to LV, but if I do, I know for certain where I will be staying.
Room Tip: As usual with this brand, ask for a room facing the courtyard for a more tranquil view.

We picked this hotel because it was close to the Convention Center and the monorail -- and it was a great choice. No casino to walk through, but casinos nearby if you want them. Great breakfast (for a fee) -- to-order eggs and some of the most delicious oatmeal I've ever had! Our room (133) was kind of dark because of plantings outside the window, and the room was smaller than average, but all was clean and in good order. Good service, free parking, easy room access, guest laundry. Great choice for convention needs, especially if you're not too into the gambling scene and prefer a non-smoking environment.
Room Tip: Our room did NOT have a balcony. If you want one, ask for it.

The rooms were clean & comfy, the pool was nice, and the location is great--right across the street from the monorail station. But it was the customer service that made it all worth it. Ruby & Tasia & Wonda became like family. They greeted us as we came in the door, and wished us a good day as we left. In a city like Vegas, where fake and fantasy are the norm, it was very nice to have a place that felt genuine and homey. Also very nice to have a place with nor cigarette smoke and dinging bells and flashy lights (no casino here! ) . Kudos to the staff at this hotel.
Room Tip: With only 3 floors, all the rooms are easy to get to. We were on the second floor, and the stairs we...

It was across the street from the convention center (handy for the business part of the trip), and directly across from the monorail station. A quick ride and you're down on the strip. It was great to go out on the town and come back to a quiet, smoke free hotel. The staff was exceptionally friendly and helpful. I would definitely stay here again!</p><br>1st Time To Vegas<p>We felt we were home and were treated like family during our five-day stay. I needed a pair of scissors late one evening. The pair they had at the front desk was not very sharp. The security person went to her car and loaned me her personal scissors. They were all very helpful and went out of there way to make our stay pleasant. Ms. Duske got us a cab in record time and always had great ideas about what to see in Las Vegas how to get around. Everyone was so helpful and never appeared troubled with our many questions. The room was clean and more than adequate for our needs - even with our daughter and husband coming for a couple days. We hope to come purely for fun the next time and my wife refuses to stay anywhere else. Even though not on the strip, the hotel is a five minute walk from the monorail station and a 5 minute ride to the stip.
Room Tip: Our room faced north and was very quite
See more room tips</p><br>Best stay ever<p>5 stars for service. It's location across the street from the Convention Center makes it the perfect location for being close to the action and yet enough distance to make your stay quiet and peaceful. The professional front desk staff are like old friends and the caf√© food is wonderful. The rooms are updated, roomy and very clean. Even the maintenance staff greeted me with a smile. Vegas can feel impersonal with a glittery facade, but this hotel is pleasantly real.

Besides being across the street from the Convention Center, this location also has a short walk to the monorail for easy access to The Strip and is an easy drive to Hoover Dam and Downtown Vegas..</p><br>A fresh and convenient oasis amidst the loud and smoky glitz<p>This is a standard Courtyard Marriott, two stories, directly across the street from the Las Vegas Convention Center. I was so glad I stayed there as opposed to one of the better-known convention, resort or casino hotels! It is clean, QUIET, and you are not immersed in noise, chaos and stale cigarette smoke as you walk from the lobby to the rest of the hotel -- the latter is the condition at most of the other LV hotels. The Courtyard has a breakfast/dinner/snack service bar and a pool, and the staff are friendly and helpful. If you are in this city on business (especially for a convention) and not for leisure or something where you expect to lounge all day in the hotel, this one is ideal.</p><br>Awesome<p>Customer service was top notch, it made me feel like I was staying with family I was treated very well, located just across the stree from the convention center. Great place to stay! I would give it a five out of five</p><br>Clean, quiet, free parking, next to the Convention Center!<p>This hotel is steps away from the Convention Center. The staff is so very nice, and friendly. The room was immaculate, and I didn't hear a peep from the halls or outside during my entire stay! The convenience factor is amazing: I have never before been able to walk to the Convention Center. Also, the Vegas Monorail is right across the street, so it is easy to leave the rental car parked at the hotel. For explorations, being right on Paradise Blvd, it is easy to also head north to Downtown, West to Red Rocks, or East to Hoover Dam!</p><br>Thea Wright &amp; Matthew Riddle Excellent Service!<p>Thea Wright - guest service representative's service was impeccable.
Thea did everything in her power to make me feel comfortable and special as a guest.

Thea, has a winning smile & personality she was very attentive to my every need. Thea is an excellent representative for Marriott Hotels.

Thea Wright, Up-holds the Marriott image & brand. I'm convinced I could not have received better service or be more please anywhere else. Thank You Thea, see you soon!!

Matthew Riddle, Head Chief. I can taste why he is the "Head Chief." They don't have full service but Matthew is an excellent chief. I had the best eggs i've ever had in my life! What happen was I meant to say eggs with cheese but i forgot too. When I asked Matthew to sprinkle a little cheese on top, well that wasn't good enough for and he said let me do the eggs over! That was so nice of him to do that. Matthew wanted to present his food in the best way posible. These were the best eggs that i've ever tasted in my life. When I said can you put some cheese on top of my eggs, and he said no I will do them over Matthew made my day.

Matthew's service was off the chain. I can't wait to return again, I only hope when I do he's still there because I've got to have his eggs & cheese again!

Everything else on the plate was good but the eggs were delicious because he took the extra time to really please me. Thank You Matthew see you soon!!
