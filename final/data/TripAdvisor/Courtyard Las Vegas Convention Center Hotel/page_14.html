Our meeting planner chose the hotel, and after staying for 5 days, 4 nights, I can see why. The staff is amazing. The location is off the strip and void of slot machines, but close enough via walking, taxi or monorail to the strip and their landmark hotels. After a bumpy first night in a room facing the road (which was noisy in spite of pretty sound proof windows), I was able to move to a quiet room. That is when I first met Ruby, who would prove to be everywhere we needed her to be! She ran the front desk, served as the barista when the bistro was closed, and filled in as the wine steward as well! I had leftovers from dinner the night before at the Venetian's restaurant and she helped me get them reheated. She did everything with a smile. Our meeting had all meals catered by the onsite Bistro and the food and service was impeccable. Great coffee, fresh fruit, hot breakfast and lunch, and box lunches for the trip home that were delicious. Housekeeping went above and beyond, with the housekeeping manager walking the hallways and asking guests if their rooms were cleaned to their satisfaction. So, what started out as a trip that I was not expecting to be fun (it was 102 degrees when I landed in Vegas), was more than tolerable, thanks in great part to the staff of the hotel. I would stay there again, and it would be my first choice, business or pleasure. Non-smoking and lack of slots is a big plus (and their is no residual smell of smoke as one reviewer suggested).
Room Tip: Ask for a room that does not face the street. Options are poolside or facing the parking lot shared...

Checking in was fast.The desk clerk was friendly and efficient. We liked that the parking lot was near the rooms unlike the massive parking garages in the casino hotels. This was the perfect refuge. Our evening meal was wonderful despite the limited choice. The young man behind the cafe counter was knowledgeable about the area and exceedingly friendly to us and other guests, so we gave him a big tip. Breakfast the next morning was surprisingly good. We will stay here again. It's a convenient place to stay -- near the convention center. The monorail is right across the street.</p><br>I think their remodel is complete so this is now a nicer Courtyard to stay at<p>This was my second time staying at this Courtyard. Marriott is now non-smoking, but given that Vegas is a smoker-friendly town, this Courtyard still had a strong smoking resonance (especially in the hallways). This was very noticeable on my first visit but not as bad on this visit. They have been doing a remodel and the new rooms feel much fresher and more comfortable with better working A/C units. The biggest problem with this Courtyard is that it is very far from The Strip. It is a long walk to The Strip. The monorail is close though.

Pros: Remodeled rooms are fresher and more contemporary than quite a few Courtyards out there, reasonable room rates if you are booking last minute, convenient location if you are working at the Las Vegas Convention Center, nice staff.

Cons: You could probably get a similar or better room rate at a hotel on The Strip through a travel site, The Renaissance is also nearby and is a much better Marriott brand hotel with an occasionally similar room rate, a little far from The Strip, feels like a Courtyard so if you want that Vegas experience, you will not get it here.</p><br>Friendly Staff<p>My husband was in Vegas for business, so I joined him for a few days and since we are loyal to Marriott, we chose to stay here so I could relax by the pool while he was at his meetings. The property had a scratch-off promotion and we won a $20 credit in the Courtyard Cafe. When I inquired at the front desk as to how to redeem, the clerk was very helpful. The staff at the cafe was very friendly and helpful. I ordered breakfast and it was very good - eggs, bacon, and potatoes. It also came with toast, but when I said I didn't want it, I was offered some fruit. My only complaint about breakfast was that they had no to-go boxes, so I carried my food back to room uncovered.

The room was nice and I like that when it was remodeled they took out the closet and put in a countertop with mini-fridge underneath. This gives ample room for two guests to have toiletries out. There is an armoire in which to hang your clothes.

My only complaint is not about the hotel, but more the guests. I saw guests smoking in multiple locations - doorways of their room, on their patio, on their balcony, and at the pool. Maybe it's the guests here in Vegas as I have not seen this much disregard for the no smoking policy that Marriott has. Also, people had beer, wine, and liquor bottles at the pool. I overheard one guest tell his friend he couldn't see the pool rules to determine if glass was against the rules.

Hotel has ample free parking, as well as complimentary WiFi. It is convenient to the convention center and the monorail.</p><br>Good business location for convention center<p>I recently spent 3 nights at the Vegas Courtyard by Marriott on a business trip. I deliberately chose a quieter, less flamboyant Vegas hotel in order not to be stressed by millions of guests and flashing lights. The courtyard is a simple business hotel a short ride from the airport and opposite the convention center in Vegas. There is monorail station directly opposite the hotel with trains running every 6 minutes – perfect for getting around if you don’t like driving. The spacious double room had a comfortable bed, this being one of my more important selection criteria. Like other Marriott Courtyards, the bistro was quick and efficient for a breakfast snack – but don’t expect anything more. There is a small fitness room and outdoor pool for a spot of exercise. Aside from the air conditioning not being the quietest I have experienced, the hotel was efficient and uncomplicated.</p><br>Great Staff and Experience<p>We decided to stay at this hotel because it was cheaper than hotels on the strip, yet still walking distance to the strip. Every encounter with every staff member was great. They are working hard, and very friendly. We ate at the cafe on sight for breakfast, it was very delicious. Check in and Checkout was quick without problems. Monorail at the convention center is directly across the street, which makes accessing the South End of the Strip much quicker as well. I would highly recommend any to stay at this hotel. The only thing I would suggest changing is the towels, they were a little scratchy. We will Return :). We were traveling as 4 friends age 25-35.</p><br>Stay off the strip<p>My experience was pretty consistent with other reviewers. Refreshed lobby was great. Breakfast and evening receptions were well done. Rooms in need of an update. Great off the strip location. Really enjoyed leaving the smoky casinos behind.</p><br>Great Choice if you are attending a convention!<p>With a newly remodeled lobby, this Courtyard is unique in that it offers hot cooked breakfast to order and an espresso bar. As well as a simple, casual dinner menu and full bar in the evenings. The walk to the convention center is 1/2 block and across the street. The staff are friendly and readily available to help. The room has a small refrigerator. The flat screen TV is reasonable size LG. the cable offers 4 HBO channels and 8 ESPN channels (among others) via Dish. The satellite seemed to pause/ cut out on many channels. I am not sure if it was just my room or throughout the property. There is a desk, small couch and coffee table.

Located off strip, the closest casino is the Las Vegas Hotel, a short 5-min walk. The strip is ~1/3 mile away, the closest major hotels on the strip are Riviera, Wynn, Encore and Palazzo. Along the way is a large Walgreens, where you can stock up on water, soda and snacks for the room and show.

The hotel is directly across from the monorail stop at the convention center, offering alternative transportation to the strip.

We are happy with the choice to stay here for our trad show and will do so again. We appreciated a quiet, safe, low key place to stay in the middle of Las Vegas.</p><br>Below average in a tough town...<p>In the interest of full disclosure: not a town I would go to unless I absolutely needed to. The hotel is not on the strip and there are locations within walking distance of the convention center with less-expensive rooms, on-site restaurants and better amenities. As for Marriott properties in the greater Las Vegas area: the JW Marriott resort, just 6 miles east of the strip, is a vastly superior property with many dining alternatives, on-site casino, spa and resort services, and superior service staff and amenities for the same price.</p><br>Never Again!<p>I chose this hotel primarily because it is a business hotel and it is located off the strip. That way I can retreat back to the hotel and enjoy a quiet night. I had prepaid for this room on www.marriott.com so I all I had to do was give them my credit card for incidentals. Apparently when I got there, they had no record of my payment. They tried to tell me that marriott.com doesn't bill the credit card. Well obviously it does because my credit card was charged. I showed my online statement to the manager and he said it wasn't for this hotel. Well I told him yes it was because this was the only hotel I booked and the rate and everything matched. The manager did nothing to help me. I had to pay for the room again and dispute the charge with my bank which was a huge inconvenience. The manager said he has been with Marriott for 15 years, but it really doesn't show. I used to work for Marriott and my manager would go out of her way to assist the guests as that is their job. I found the staff at this hotel to be very unprofessional - chewing gum behind the desk etc. The only staff member that I found to be enjoyable was the night auditor when I checked out. She was very pleasant. The movies that you can purchase in the room are not great. First of all they are expensive $17.99 for a regular movie. Also not a lot to choose from. I did not even try the bistro or the continental breakfast. I found the market to be useful. It was very convenient. I did not enjoy my stay at this hotel and I assure you I will not be back. I will also advise everyone I know in CANADA not to stay at this hotel. They are better off to stay on the strip. I would suggest to Marriott that they send someone to this hotel to give the manager a more training. A customer service program like SUPER HOST will also benefit the staff of this hotel.</p><br></body></html>
