<html><head><h3>Courtyard Las Vegas Convention Center Hotel Reviews Page 18</h3></head><body><br>A motel for the price of a hotel<p>This Courtyard has not been renovated although it features the new Marriott bedding. It is close to the convention center and to the Monorail (fee) and caters to convention attendees although it lacks a...business center! It is approximately one very long block to the strip which we thought was too much to ask in the hot sun.

Our assigned room at 120 per night had a constantly running toilet. Beds felt OK, but because of the toilet issue and the outdated, rundown look and feel of the hotel (it looked like an old motel) we decided to try our luck with a hotel on the strip instead. Front desk was kind enough to cancel any charges. We would recommend trying the Marriott Suites, Springhill Suites or another Las Vegas Marriott property for better value until this Courtyard gets renovated.

There are no nearby restaurants but the hotel offers menus from restaurants that deliver.</p><br>Nice place and near convention center<p>As a business traveler, I hate getting a rental car and I hate to pay taxi fares even more. This hotel is right accross from the convention center and I really didn't miss the ding, ding, ding of the casino world. If you are in need a of place close by LVCC, this is a good stop, right accross the street and you can also take the monirail to the strip if you are interested (a bit of a hike from the strip hotel stations to the strip itself, but much cheaper than a cab).</p><br>Better than you expect<p>We originally decided to stay here because of my husband's rewards miles which allowed us to stay for free. We figured we'd try it even though it was off the strip mainly because it was suppose to be right next to the tram.

When we first arrived we were greeted by the friendly staff. Check-in was a little crowded and I think you need to be aware of this since it's near the convention center and draws large business crowds. That weekend there wasn't a huge event happening and it was still a little crowded.

The rooms were very nice and clean although your standard room with bed and tiny desk but the bathroom/shower was very nice. We decided to eat at the restaurant/bar downstairs and the food was absolutely delicious. The decor of the entire hotel was much nicer that I expected and I was very impressed. And since it has no casino it was nice and smoke free.

The tram is across the hotel parking lot and convention parking lot. It's a 5 minute walk. Not as close as some made it seem but not far either and since you're not staying in a huge hotel which takes you 20 minutes just to get through the lobby, it ends up being faster too. It was so convenient getting to MGM from this location in a quick 15 minutes.

Checkout was easy too. Overall very pleasant experience and we'd consider staying again.</p><br>Great for the price, not so good for the average Las Vegas visit.<p>Best thing about this hotel is that we got it cheap and on short notice. We paid $79 per night on 4th of july weekend. Also, the hotel is right across the street from the monorail. The rooms were average with the no frills look to them. The best thing about the room was that the blinds blocked out 100% of the midday sun. We woke up at 1pm and thought it was still nighttime.</p><br>Good find<p>Nice hotel, very friendly staff and located short walk from the strip (5-10 minute walk from Wynns & Encore). It's also within walking distance of the light rail system. Hotel, rooms and pool were clean. The pool currently overlooks Wynns & Encore, but it's located just off the street and entrance to the garage. Therefore, you'll hear traffic noise. The pool area is not very big, so if there are noisy guests or kids you'll have nowhere to seek quietness. Free self parking offered. Very comfortable bed - double beds were not offered. Free connection to your airline check-in site is offered, so you can print your boarding pass in the lobby. Wireless connection is offered in your room. I would stay here again.</p><br>Sufficient, but mainly targeted to the "convention people"<p>After a week in Marriott's Grand Chateau, we drove back to the airport where we got hit by a car and ende up in the hospital. We missed our flight and on doctor's advice we had to stay resting. So we said to a cab driver to tale us to the closest courtyard, as we know what kind of room and bed to expect. We didn't use too much the facilities, but stayed in the room basically for several days.

The room was okay and sufficient for our needs: two seperate beds, which helped dealing better with our injuries and bruizes. They had some items to buy: pills were handy, the bread offereings were a bit dull. We used the external room service, which we can not advice: they forgot an order and it was not too tasty (and a rather questionable eastern european (?) man came to deliver the food). But since we did not have to many other options, we had to use it.

I was surprised with the lack of compasion from the staff, they could see we were in pain: but no one talked to us if they could help or anything... The hotel quoted us a price at checkin, but did not inform us they would raise the price the second night. I complained and they used the original rate. We are frequent Marriott guests (silver level) and have had better experiences with Courtyard in europe. This was basically a business hotel for business people. (You see them dealing in the lobby and going to the convention center across the road). Not a hotel for families (even though they have a pool). It is off the strip, but neither that far away from it (behind the Wynn, sortof)...

For what we paid you can find a better price on the strip. I usually check travelcomparing.com for prices. The benefit for us, was that we did not have to walk so much in a huge hotel on the strip to get to our room with our suitcases... It helped us get through our time of pain.</p><br>Convenient to the Convention Center<p>I stayed at the Courtyard - Convention Center while in Las Vegas for CES 2009.

I was primarily looking for a clean, comfortable, and convenient place to stay, and the Courtyard fit the bill. The hotel is across Paradise Rd. from the Convention Center, a short walk to any of the center's entrances, which made it incredibly convenient to the CES exhibits. It is also only about a half mile from the Strip as well.

My room was comfortable and laid out well, with a king-size bed, ample work surface, small couch, and coffee table. A separate "bar" area near near the bathroom provided a place for the ice bucket, glasses, and coffee maker, leaving the entire desk space open for spreading out a laptop, paperwork, and things like charging a cell phone, camera, etc. Like most Courtyards, the hotel is situated around a central courtyard, including an outdoor pool, with each room opening onto a small balcony. (My room happened to look out over the south parking lot, but had a good view of palm trees and some of the hotels on the Strip.)

The hotel staff was friendly and courteous. Free wired and wireless Internet access was available. Free printing from a kiosk in the lobby is also available (which worked great for printing my airline boarding pass). The restaurant is only open for breakfast and offers a buffet and a few cooked-to-order options. The breakfast buffet was a bit pricey, but was a great start to the day.

During CES, the hotel also planned a few extras to make thing easier for attendees, including boxed to-go lunches, a nightly shuttle to/from the Strip, and was helpful in arranging taxis.

I really enjoyed my stay, and will definitely check into staying at the Courtyard next time I attend an event at the Las Vegas Convention Center.</p><br>Great Business Accomodations for Convention Center<p>Great escape from all the glitz. Competely smoke free. The staff was friendly and helpful from the first step into the lobby until I left. The room was comfortable, clean, and geared for someone on a business trip like myself. Pleanty of work space to spread out my papers. High speed internet was so-so, but free. There's a great all-you-can-eat buffet breakfast in the morining ($11) and you can walk across the street to the convention center. Only a cheap $12 cab ride to the airport. I used their business center in the lobby area to print my boarding pass.

I only wish there was someplace within walking distance to have dinner under $30.</p><br>Great Place<p>The Courtyard was a really nice place to stay, the location was good for anyone looking to get away from the strip. rooms where nice and the staff friendly.</p><br>Very Convenient, Close but not too Close<p>As others have said, if you want the mayhem, noise and lights of the Las Vegas strip, this hotel is not for you. If you want convenience to the Hilton Convention Center and a short walk to the strip - it's the best. The typical Courtyard quality located in Sin City.

The staff was nice. The complementary cookies were cold, hard and crunchy (I like warm, soft and tender). No free food in the morning but there's a breakfast place there. They have the in-the-lobby-business-center which is well kept but hardly quiet.

All in all, a reasonable rate in a city of outrageous costs!
