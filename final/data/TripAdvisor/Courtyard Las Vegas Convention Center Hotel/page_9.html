We stayed for two nights and we very satisfied with the property. This hotel was very clean and secure that's important to me. It's an older property and I see they have replaced the shower curtain rods with the curved ones for more room in the shower. They also have new and very nice shower heads but didn't replace the rusted toilet paper holder. Odd since that's a couple of bucks. They also didn't have a phone book or any information in the room on Vegas or the hotel. Although these are little things it would have been helpful. The bed was comfortable but the feather pillows the first night smelled so I asked for foam and that was better. The lobby was nice and the young lady at the reservation desk quite pleasant. There is a small dining/bar area that's only open certain hours but you can buy drinks from a small store area behind the reservation desk. They also have free wifi and that's nice in this day and age. If not for the pillows I would have given this hotel another star, an easy fix for the manager I think.
Room Tip: I think bottom floor facing the courtyard, they have chairs on the porches and if it's not 106 o...

I feel like the character "Norm" when he walked into Cheers. Everyone from the front desk to the Bistro makes a point to say hello to me -- I travel a lot and honestly feel like the Las Vegas Courtyard makes me feel like I'm home. Katie is one of the single best customer service specialists I have ever had the pleasure to have as a server. (Tuesday evening 9/8)</p><br>Absolutely perfect<p>We stayed in this lovely hotel just 3 nights last 20th of August. It is simply spotless in everything: services, position and customers service. I really recommend it to everybody. Thank you for making our holiday so special. Sabrina</p><br>Very Good<p>Very nice hotel. Clean rooms. Comfortable bed. Could be closer to Strip, but would be more expensive then :) Service ok. AC in the room. Breakfast with additional charge. No problem with finding parking place.</p><br>Las Vegas Bball Tournament with Kids<p>I was in Las Vegas for a basketball tournament in July 2014. The front desk staff really is what makes this hotel great. They are extremely helpful and go out of their way to make sure you have everything you need to have a great stay. Its directly across from the convention center, which is where we played. We were very close to the strip without worrying about all the traffic on the strip. Price was a great weekend value in Vegas.

The common areas in the hotel were a nice place for the kids to congregate and hang out. The kids enjoyed the pool (It was a little cool the second day) and the outdoor patio was nice even in the heat. Unlike hotels on the strip, the pool was open late which the kids loved.</p><br>Excellent Experience<p>I had an excellent experience at Courtyard Las Vegas Convention Center. The hotel is well maintained. The staff is courteous, efficient and customer focused. In particular, Ruby (Guest Services) exemplifies the previously mentioned staff qualities. Thanks!
Mike J.</p><br>Trade Show Stay<p>I went out to Las Vegas from August 1 - 6th for a trade show. The Courtyard is directly across from the convention center, next to a Residence Inn. I was by myself and stayed in a room with two double beds, (requested). The room was big, the bed was super comfortable, and the staff was spectacular. They were extremely friendly and helpful. The Bistro staff were also terrific. It is a 10 minute walk to the Convention Center. I loved my stay there. The best part for me was when they called a cab for you, the cab was usually there before you made it downstairs. I went downtown a couple of nights to eat. I had no problem getting a cab to and from the hotel. The staff really are amazing. I will definitely stay there next year for the convention.
Room Tip: As a Marriott Card holder and by myself, I elected to stay at the Courtyard. Right next door, and l...

It was 117 degrees the day I checked out and my luggage was "extra heavy" with the books fro my conferencel. Tasia was very helpful and hospitable. I wanted to change out of my shoes which were hurting me feet but was afraid the cab would come while I was doing so. She watched my luggage and then came to get me just in time. She was very attentive and handed me a small bottle of water when she noticed I was dehydrated. Thank you so much Tasia! You are a true asset and I'll be back to stay at another Courtyard Marriott!</p><br>Quiet, convenient, with especially helpful staff<p>The hotel is across from the Las Vegas Convention Center, and it is quiet: no casino! Perfect for a serious convention-goer.
The staff is friendly and helpful to everyone. But what the staff did that was special was to email me after I had left to ask about about a photo ID that I had accidentally left behind in the room where I had stayed. I had not contacted the hotel because I had no idea that I had lost it there. At my request, the staff mailed it to me at the address on the ID. I was delighted to have it back!</p><br>Above and Beyond!<p>I want everyone to know how amazing our stay at the Las Vegas Convention Center Marriott was on July 4 weekend. Most Marriotts we stay in are wonderful, but this one went above and beyond my expectations. The hotel was very clean, it felt very safe, and most importantly, the water pressure for the shower was out of this world (I have super thick, long hair, so that's an important feature for me)! If there was a button on this review page for awesome shower, I would most certainly click it. However, the best part of the hotel was the staff. Everyone was extremely nice to us, and they put up with my crazy family and handled any issues like champions. I would like to specifically recommend Tasia Duske, the front office supervisor, for any needs during your stay. She was exceptionally wonderful, and after we told her about our wedding plans for Vegas, she had a very sweet card sent to our room. She was not only nice, but she seemed like she genuinely enjoyed what she did, which is so refreshing these days. The hotel in general may not be on the strip, be trendy, have a casino, or be the newest building on the block, but what matters are the clean, comfy rooms, great food for breakfast, and the TOP NOTCH staff. If you are in town for a conference or CES, I HIGHLY recommend the Courtyard Las Vegas Convention Center.
Room Tip: We had a room on the right side, which is by the workout area and a back exit. It made it super con...
