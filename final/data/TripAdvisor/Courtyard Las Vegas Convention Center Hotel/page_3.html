<html><head><h3>Courtyard Las Vegas Convention Center Hotel Reviews Page 3</h3></head><body><br>Basketball Trip<p>Room was very clean beds were comfortable noise quality was great we did not have any problems with noise shower was big and worked great also the pool is outdoor and it was nice salt water pool not chlorine so that was a nice change and it was not busy great family hotel especially if you have little kids the only down fall is there is not a continental breakfast and they took my teen daughters necklace and ring told them and never heard from again but it's posted there not responsible for theft that is the only complaint I had also it was short walking distance to convention centers and strip.</p><br>Would stay here again in a heartbeat!<p>While I enjoy the hustle and bustle of The Strip while I’m playing, I wanted a quiet and smoke-free hotel to come back to every night. This hotel worked great for me in both regards, quiet at night and very clean/smoke-free. Thea, my new Maui friend, was so friendly and helpful during my early check-in. The location was great, I never rent a car in Las Vegas but it was very easy to take the SDX bus from this hotel to/from the strip each day. I’ve stayed in a number of hotels during my various visits to Las Vegas, both on and off the strip, and this is the first one I would definitely stay in again!</p><br>Very comfortable, very clean<p>We came to Las Vegas for a quick trip with our four teens. There was plenty of room for us all. The pool bleached one of our bathing suits, so wear an old one. The staff was very helpful. My 16 year old wants you to know that the Fiji water was adequate.</p><br>Beautiful and Relaxig<p>We were greeted by Thea when we checked in she had nonstop smiles and helped us navigate through a few places in the area. The entire staff welcomed us to and from the hotel. Food and food service was also excellent. Clean pool, firm beds, quiet and enjoyable experience.

Room Tip: Our room was about 7 rooms from elevator toward the end of hall and extremely quiet and comfortable

The staff was excellent, from Alex at the front desk and Wanda in the breakfast restaurant to housekeeping. Alejandro helped me with my bags and Irma cleaned my room--both were wonderful at their jobs. The whole place had a feeling of a well-oiled-machine. I didn't have dinner but breakfast was delicious. I wish the restaurant was open for lunch thought. If you're going to a convention. sTAY HERE!!!</p><br>A CONVENTION ATTENDEE'S DREAM!<p>The convenience of their location is only heightened by the responsiveness of the staff! The bistro was exceptional and made many variations to meet the needs of many vegetarian and gluten-free patrons! They also opened early so that their conference clientele could make their 7:00am sessions with a hearty breakfast beforehand. The desk staff (especially Thea and Heather) went above and beyond. The local pizza joint Heather recommended was wonderful and offered speedy delivery! Rooms were lovely and I had NOTHING but wonderful experiences there.
Room Tip: I was on the third floor, very quiet.
See more room tips</p><br>Excellent front desk service!<p>We arrived early and was immediately greeted with a smile. Our room was not ready but the staff made an excellent effort to quickly prepare a room for us. Jose at the front desk was friendly, knowledgeable about the area and transportation options. Not only did he make sure we were comfortable with our room, he made sure we had everything we needed and more!!!! He was definitely super helpful even before knowing we were four sisters honoring the passing of one of our other sisters. The room was roomy and the beds were comfortable. We would definitely stay here again!</p><br>Above and Beyond<p>This property is secluded and quiet yet close enough to get to the action Pronto!!!! The staff greets you warmly and will do just about anything to make your stay more comfortable. Jose even went and picked up what we needed and brought back to us, as we had no private transportation!</p><br>Came through at the last minute<p>I'm very grateful to this hotel for coming through for me recently! I was in Las Vegas and no room to stay in, last minute plans to stay over, every place I checked was sold out. This was after midnight, I was in a panic. I called up the 800 line for Marriott, a female operator helped me out and found this hotel with rooms available. I checked in around 1 a.m. It was such a relief to have a place to stay! Room was great, PRICE WAS REASONABLE(very important point in Vegas), and got the job done. Thank you for helping me out at the last minute!</p><br>Spur of the moment trip<p>We lucked into this place. It was a little farther off the strip than we would have preferred, but close enough. The bed was AMAZING! We both agreed it was the most comfortable bed we have ever slept in. The place was immaculate, the staff was friendly and helpful, and the room was comfortable. I would have preferred a hotel with a casino, but all in all it was a great stay and a fun few days.</p><br></body></html>
