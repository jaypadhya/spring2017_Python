Thanks La Quinta for being pet friendly. Steve at front desk was friendly and helpful with local info. Comfy rooms, any time we are in vegas we stay here!</p><br>Just like home!<p>Excellent breakfast and rooms! This location is great for those not wanting the hassle of the Strip. It is near the highway and shopping centers and very close to residential areas. The rooms are big and well-kept. There is ample parking and a big pool. This place provides good service and it is an excellent choice for those with kids!</p><br>helpful staff comfertable stay<p>We were in town for my son's wedding. We found La Quinta Inn a really nice place to stay. One of the truly pet friendly hotels in Vegas. Our stay was very nice and they even had doggy do do bags for the fur guests to use. Would highly recommend this hotel. Will visit here again.</p><br>Great<p>Had a great stay. we checked in late at night, the clerk was awesome and took care of us. the rooms were very nice, the staff was good, and we had a great breakfast. I was traveling for over 20 days, and this was the nicest stay on this trip.</p><br>Away from the Strip<p>If you are looking for a comfortable place to stay that is away from the strip, this is a good choice. Just off US 95, it has easy access to downtown and the Strip, but a much more relaxed atmosphere. It is one of the newer format LaQuinta's and well maintained. I found the accommodations and services to be more satisfactory. When I checked in, the refrigerator in my room wasn't cooling and they promptly sent someone up and replaced the unit.

I was in Las Vegas for a 4 day convention near by. The convention hotel had no rooms for the 1st two nights, so I checked in here with plans to move to the convention hotel for the last two days. I was so happy with the accommodations, I decided to cancel my reservation at the other hotel and stay here for all four nights.

If you don't need all the amenities of a resort hotel and just want a nice, clean comfortable place to rest and relax, this is a good choice.</p><br>Peace in Vegas<p>We were so happy to stay at a hotel in Las Vegas that did not have a casino. The location is easy to get to and was a great one for us as we were visiting friends in Summerlin, which meant we could stay off the highway most of the time. Having a suite with separate sleeping and sitting areas was great. There were signs of a little wear and tear but overall the room was very good. The bed was comfortable so we got a good night's sleep, and the breakfast in the morning was just right for us though a hot selection besides waffles might be nice on occasion. Can't say enough good things about the staff. The front desk clerks and breakfast lady were extremely friendly and helpful and made us feel very welcome. This is a good place to stay if you want to be away from the hustle and bustle of the strip and still have everything you need within reach.</p><br>Odor of Smoke in Non-Smoking Rooms<p>I was traveled with a sports team and we had 9 rooms. ALL of them smelled of Smoke - ALL had ash trays in the rooms - ALL were labeled as Non-Smoking. One room was so bad that we had to change locations because of the terrible odor. This hotel needs to reevaluate their non- smoking rooms. The bath tub also left much to be desired.</p><br>Pleasant overnight stay<p>Clean and comfortable, They take pets which is important to us. The staff was pleasant. The neighborhood was quite pleasant and convenient for our purposes. Nice park nearby for walking or running. The area was very quiet. There was good internet access which is important to us as we travel a lot and use it for news and planning for more of our trip. The breakfast was adequate but not a wide choice of warm dishes...have waffles, but nothing else.</p><br>My stay at La quinta<p>The employees are helpful and friendly. The rooms are clean and comfortable. The place is a pleasant surprise because is look and behaves at 5 start resort. I definitely will choose it again for my stay.</p><br>Comfortable, Convenient, and Friendly<p>I have used this specific La Quinta on three separate occasions for it's location - near friends and hiking areas.

They have a very cheerful and professional staff, clean rooms, and very comfortable beds.

I will stay here every time I visit and so do many others that I met in the lobby. Many of the wonderful staff members have worked here for years and are truly welcoming to returning guests.</p><br></body></html>
