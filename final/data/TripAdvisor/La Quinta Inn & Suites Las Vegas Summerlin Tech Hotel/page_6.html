<html><head><h3>La Quinta Inn & Suites Las Vegas Summerlin Tech Hotel Reviews Page 6</h3></head><body><br>Adequate<p>I regularly stay at La Quinta in my home state for business, so when my vacation rental in Vegas was short one day for my recent conference there, I decided to try the Summerlin La Quinta for the extra day. Unfortunately, the experience was less than stellar. There was no one at the front desk when I arrived for check-in at around 6:00 pm. I had requested a west-facing suite &, without explanation, was given an east-facing one right against the interstate. Road noise interfered with sleep. Like other La Quinta rooms in which I've stayed, this one had a refrigerator & a microwave, which was nice. In my home state, however, the suites typically include a full kitchenette -- not available at the Summerlin facility, I was told. More troublesome, the housekeeping was not the best. The center of the carpet in my room had been vacuumed, but not the edges. When I sat down on the floor to put on my shoes the following morning, I was met with the strong odor of dog urine. The front desk staff did not seem all that concerned when I reported it. Had I not been leaving for other accommodations after one night, I would have asked for another room.</p><br>Good Stay<p>Went to Vegas to visit brother in ICU at VA hospital. The Front Desk staff was exceptionally friendly and helpful. Housekeeping did a great job cleaning the room. The breakfast was hosted by a friendly staff. It was loaded with carbs and could have used some hot protein. My only big complaint was the very old, stained bathtub. I opted for showers because of it. Otherwise, great staff and an almost perfect room. Also a perk was the location to good, fast restaurants and the freeway.</p><br>What you would expect.<p>This is what you would expect from a La Quinta location. The service was good. The breakfast is pretty standard with waffles, cereal, pastries, and yogurt. The wafflemakers can get pretty backed up when the hotel is busy. The rooms are a little dated but comfortable. We did not have a refrigerator in our room but I think some of them do. It would be a nice amenity to add. We ended up using the stairs a lot because the elevators were a little slow and busy. The location was very good since we were there for soccer. Wi-fi was pretty slow. The pool and hot tub were fine. Two major soccer complexes are very close by. Not close to the strip but close to freeway access.</p><br>Nice for an extended stay<p>Great customer service, not an excellent location for my trip. Having a full size fridge and cooktop comes in handy if you're there for more than a few nights. Nacho Daddy's is across the parking lot and has several menu options. Not convenient to the strip if that's what you're in town for.</p><br>Good Value<p>Room was clean, staff was professional and service was very good. Bed was great with a soft pillow top. Rooms face the freeway and thought the noise would be a problem. Went to sleep easily anyway. Breakfast was hot, easy to serve.</p><br>Quiet, clean, away from Strip<p>Good spot to stay away from the strip. Easy to get on freeway. Staff is friendly and helpful. Breakfast is nothing exciting, but adequate. Good spot for those visiting Las Vegas for business or family visits.</p><br>Pass this one by<p>Usually we love La Quinta so this was a new experience for us. The lobby looked great and our check in was smooth. We drove around to go in the side door ( closest to our room) and right outside the door was the smoking area so everytime the door was opened smoke wafted in and right up the stairs, we even noticed the smell in corridor on the 2nd floor. Our room was basically clean except for the dog hair from a previous guest. The bed linen must not have fit properly cause it kept coming undone. We went down and got a cup of coffee ( available 24 hours ) and it was horrid but we thought it was just because it was so late in the day. The next morning breakfast was served from 6 - 9 am. We went down around 7:30. The coffee tasted just as bad and there was hardly any food. Just 2 super small containers of yogurt, lots of hard boiled eggs, a few small muffins, some plain white or wheat bread to be toasted (no butter just whipped margarine). There was cold cereal and milk and waffles, however the waffle mix was empty and there was just a dizzle of syrup. To be honest we never went back the next morning. All of the hallways, elevator, and stairwells had dirty floors and walls</p><br>La Quinta Hotels<p>I always stay at La Quinta hotels whenever they are available. They are the best anywhere for the price. This hotel was no exception. Everything was wonderful, as usual. The only slight problem was the freeway noise, which caused me to have to sleep with a pillow on my head. Other than that, all was top notch. I will book this hotel again when I'm next in the area.</p><br>room<p>The rooms were great,bath tub could be refinished. Location was perfect, close proximity to hwy, airport, eateries, and where we needed to be as well as staff, we had a nice time considering it was for visiting ill family member</p><br>Hotel Stay<p>We would stay here again, if in the area. Is easy to find, friendly hotel staff. Well located for take out food, and as well as dine in. Would stay here again. Clean rooms and wonderfully pet friendly.</p><br></body></html>
