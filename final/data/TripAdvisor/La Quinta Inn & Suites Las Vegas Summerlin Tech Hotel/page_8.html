<html><head><h3>La Quinta Inn & Suites Las Vegas Summerlin Tech Hotel Reviews Page 8</h3></head><body><br>A nice place friendly staff<p>I had to stay there for 4 months with my dog after a fire at my home and the staff was very nice and helpful.. the breakfast in the morning was wonderful and the grounds were always clean.. the bed was super comfortable..service was great</p><br>Cost vs hotel accomodations<p>The price for the first night stay is what this hotels prices should be on a regular basis. It's an okay hotel. Staff was friend, and hotel was clean, but you could tell it was an older hotel. We were there to visit family and so we did not spend a whole lot of time at the hotel. The tv programming was lousy, and lousy coffee in the room and free breakfast coffee was lousy as well. Was up all night with barking dogs in the hotel all night.</p><br>Safe and Affordable<p>This La Quinta offers many rooms to stay in, which is nice because this hotel on Tenaya Way is a popular stay for visitors in Las Vegas, NV because of its great location to many popular areas. Below is a list of pros and cons of the hotel...

Pros
1. Safe location near many high end restaurants, businesses, as well as Creech AFB
2. Affordable rates and military discounts offered
3. Well lit parking lot
4. Professional front counter receptionists

Cons
1. Animals available to stay in hotel
2. Bathrooms could use a modern redesign for better quality

Overall, this is a nice hotel in a great location. The drive to the Strip is about 15 minutes, which may be too long for some people if they are factoring the time and distance to the nightlife attractions, but the hotel offers a safe, clean, and comfortable area to return to after sightseeing on the sidewalks of the Strip.</p><br>The Worst Hotel We Have Experienced<p>La Quinta requires advanced payment for a room. Most hotels hold a room reservation with a credit card and then charge the account at checkout. Therefore, my booking and pre-payment for a non-smoking, two queen-bed room should not be a problem when I check in…..WRONG.

When I checked in, the desk clerk told me that my room was given to another guest so they offered me a room with one bed. I am unpleased! Next, I notice my replacement room fails to display a non-smoking sign. I open the door, and a wave of cigarette smell attacks my senses like a dirty ashtray against my nose, so I closed the door and went back to the front desk. I told the clerk this was unacceptable.

The next room they offer isn’t better. The bedding looked dirty, ick, the tub displayed unknown hair, and I noticed innumerable filth about the room. Taking off my shoes or clothes was risky.
I could go on with the filthy elevator, stairwell reeking of urine, and other lovely experiences, but I think my point is clear. The La Quinta is a sub-standard, one-star motel at best. Run away!
Room Tip: If you would like an acceptable room, you should stay somewhere else. Unless, if you like filth, whe...

It was so bad that we checked out after our first night… when I awoke to find my bed and floor covered in animal hair. I hadn't seen it the night before as it was dark and late when we arrived. The more I looked, the more hair I found. I found hair in the hide-a-bed, under the AC unit, around every edge of the walls and nightstand. Aside from that, paint is peeling from the walls, the nonsmoking room smells of smoke, the bathtub porcelain is corroded and discolored, each corner of the bathroom was encrusted with grime, the hallways are dirty, the heated pool is cold and the breakfast that was offered is the worst hotel breakfast I have ever had (cereal and boiled eggs). On a positive note, the housekeeping supervisor came to my room and apologized for the filth. I was also refunded 1/2 nights stay and not charged a cancellation fee for the remaining nights.</p><br>You get what you pay for<p>Staff is awesome and friendly. However hotel needs an overall face lift. Hotel is approx 30 miles driving distance to the strip. I personally prefer it the traffic on the strip drives me crazy and there are great things to do and yummy foods to eat in the close proximity of the hotel. Added bonus is the Hospital is close by for any emergent needs.</p><br>convienent place to stay<p>This Hotel is right off the highway coming from the north. It was quiet and safe. The staff was very friendly and helpful which is nice when coming off a long drive. Breakfast included although no bacon or sausage was served. Stayed here instead of a casino - easier to get in and out</p><br>Saved our room after check in deadline<p>The staff was very kind and polite. The location was great for us as we were there to visit family that live nearby. getting to the strip for sightseeing was no problem. The weather was warmer than normal for the time of year so the pool was open, the kids loved this. Due to delays at the airport we were late checking in, we received a courtesy call from the front desk to confirm that we would be staying there and they assured me our room was being held. That call was very much appreciated.</p><br>Not what you expect from La Quinta<p>We arrived late at night and went straight to bed. I felt sick all night and couldn't sleep. My allergies were off the charts. When I woke up and drew the curtains back I was shocked!! My room was filthy. There was animal hair in my bed, between the sheets, under the AC unit, balls of fur by each night stand. I took pictures of the filth. The bathtub was corroded and the porcelain was chipped and discolored. The corners of the bathroom and guest room were piled high with grime. I am a loyal La Quinta customer. I seek La Quinta out every time I travel. This was horrible! The La Quinta 7 miles down the road was amazing! Very well kept and exactly what I have come to expect from this hotel chain. This hotel breakfast was the worst breakfast I have ever been offered at a hotel. One flavor of yogurt, 2 cereal options, cold boiled eggs, toast and waffles with no butter and watery syrup, no fresh fruit, and nothing hot to eat... I would expect this kind of breakfast to be served at a $30 a night hotel, not a $99 a night hotel.</p><br>Pleasurable Stay<p>Was very pleased to find a hotel to stay in that was not a casino. We were in town to visit relatives and this hotel was very convenient to them. Being able to have our elderly dog with us was a plus. Thank you for a quiet, pleasant stay! So quiet, we thought we were alone!</p><br></body></html>
