<html><head><h3>La Quinta Inn & Suites Las Vegas Summerlin Tech Hotel Reviews Page 11</h3></head><body><br>Good hotel for pets<p>We stayed at this hotel during a move and had our 2 dogs with us. The pet policy is great - no charge for 2 pets, but this particular La Quinta was a little run down (peeling wall paper). My son enjoyed the pool, and the breakfast was nice, and the staff was very friendly. It's near the highway so there is some noise.</p><br>Best deal off the strip<p>the fact this place is pet friendly was what sold me to Lq. everyone was friendly, no hassles, clean- wish there were bags for dog clean up as some people didn't clean up after their pets outside. The food was tried to be healthy and the use of styrofoam for their breakfast was horrible as it's just wasteful.</p><br>VERY GOOD<p>Have been staying at Laquinta Mountain View Hospital Las Vegas for 6 years, have had no trouble. We come to see our grandchildren in Vegas & they love the waffles. Have had to use the Mountain View Hospital and it was nice to have it close to us.</p><br>Great hotel<p>Very clean, great quality, great price, very comfortable, and clean clean clean. It was our first stay at this hotel and we loved it, we would recommended for sure, stuff was really friendly and the facility was well maintained.</p><br>Terrible Property!<p>Filthy, run down property in the heart of Las Vegas. I am a LaQ Elite Member and stay exclusive at LaQ properties... this is a disgrace to LaQuinta! Sticky substances all over the room. Could not even handle the remote control without wiping it down. Stains in the room reminded me of a crime scene!</p><br>Fix your accommodations corporate!<p>The staff are pleasant and knowledgeable. The positive experience ends there. Rooms are not maintained. Plumbing needs to be redone. Doors need to be replaced and updated. Breakfast needs to be revamped (eggs, bacon, etc.)</p><br>Doggie Hotel<p>Staff was friendly. La Quinta does not charge extra for pets and places little restriction on pet occupancy as long there are no major disturbances. I very much appreciate their pet policy & welcoming attitude.</p><br>Great Price off Strip<p>As a hiker I like to stay in the Summerlin area of Las Vegas and I also like to avoid the resort fees at the casino hotels. The La Quinta offered a good price for comfortable accommodations. I really value having a microwave, frig and high speed wifi. The free breakfast starts early and is good. I will definitely come again.</p><br>Beware this is a pet friendly hotel!<p>Average hotel at best. Pet friendly means your room may have pet urine residue and dander. The elevator was so dirty that we used the stairs for our three day stay. There was no air conditioning in the lobby for check in and breakfast. First two mornings it was 82 degrees in the lobby for breakfast. Breakfast consist of hard boiled eggs, cereal, milk coffee and some not so fresh fruit. Someone needs to get the maintenance crew in gear to get things repaired in a timely manner and keep the grounds and hotel elevator clean. Won't be coming back here.</p><br>Nice to be away from the Strip<p>Stayed for one night at the La Quinta Inns & Suites in Las Vegas and enjoyed the stay. The room was quite clean, quiet and well appointed. Had a comfy recliner, too. The breakfast with hard boiled eggs and waffles, fruit and cereal was welcome and fully stocked. Would stay again.</p><br></body></html>
