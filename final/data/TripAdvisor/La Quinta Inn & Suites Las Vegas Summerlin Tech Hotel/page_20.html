The hotel was in a nice neighboorbood -- safe, clean, friendly. If you're in Vegas and do NOT need to gamble or stay on the strip, this hotel is as perfect as perfect can be.

A better than great value for the $$ and they "give" (you do need to get down stairs by a certain time) you breakfast too! What a deal!!!!

Enjoy! :)</p><br>Awesome Staff<p>This hotel is located in the middle of several major medical facilities and the reason for our visit was surgery. The staff was courteous, kind and understanding of this fact and having an open ended reservation, as we were unsure of the check out date, was not an issue.</p><br>good stay<p>We stay here two nigth when our home air conditioner went out hot day's . This place was very nice our dog enjoy it too. Everyone of the staff was so nice. The room was nice had king bed, with microwave & fridge and very quite room large room!! So clean too Thank you to all to staff!!!
Room Tip: Price is good!!!!!!
See more room tips</p><br>very friendly staff<p>Great location for my needs (close to hospital) and pet friendly, which meant I did not have to make the trip alone. Hotel was clean and staff were friendly and helpful. Breakfast was a little sparse but overall a good value and comfortable stay.</p><br>Pleasure<p>Outstanding front desk personnel, checked in around 3:30 p.m. curb appeal perfect, great safe area to walk you dog! room very very clean and warm feeling. Did not have breakfast at this LaQuinta, but have stay at others and food has always been very good. I like the fact the have menu's where you can order for delivery. It was quiet location. could use another movie channel like showtime .</p><br>Good stay, no problems.<p>We stayed here enroute northbound and it was quite handy to the freeway. We were given a first floor room that looked out into a little courtyard by the pool, but it was right next to the exercise room. I was expecting noise from both but the room is quite well soundproofed and I wasn't bothered by any noise. There is not much of a grassy area for your dog, but next door is a office building and between the hotel and it, is a large gravelly area which is quite suitable. If you are there on a weekend the office complex is deserted and your dog could get a good run in.
Modest amenities in the room, no shower cap or body lotion for example. No fridge or microwave but the room is quite large. Towels a bit on the thin side. Large lobby and breakfast area, and the staff all seemed friendly and helpful. Modest breakfast offerings but OK.</p><br>Good location for medical stay<p>We have stayed at this hotel twice after my husbands out patient surgeries at Summerlin Hospital. A HUGE advantage of this hotel is that they have a wheel chair available. Anyone that has had to load and unload a wheelchair from a car knows how heavy they are. They also offer a hospital discount. We had a king suite because we appreciate a larger room. The upholstery of the sofa bed was a little soiled looking so I didn't give it a 5 rating, but the room was very clean. Also HUGE plus to our room was the bedding, and the king mattress was extremely comfortable.
While looking for a place near a hospital or surgery center or clinic I wish Trip advisor would add that to their "what sort of trip..." selections. It is important to find a place that is an easy drive, has a hospital discount, and an available wheel chair.</p><br>Good stay<p>We stayed at this La Quinta because it was reasonably priced for Las Vegas, and we had our pet with us. It is located very close to the freeway with several parks near by and it's about 15min to the Vegas strip.

The first room we got had a very loud A/C, and we went to the front desk and told them about it. They immediately gave us another room and came to check the a/c in the other room to ensure our satisfaction. We were very satisfied.

The room is quiet and very typical of other La Quintas. It has shopping very close by if you need anything and parks within a block and a large dog park only a few block away.

This was a very good experience.</p><br>What a great place!<p>I stayed at this La Quinta Inn for 6 days to attend to a family funeral. The manager (Arnold) and his staff were very accomodating for the duration of my stay. We had family from out of state come in and they also stayed here. It was so nice to have everyone together at such an affordable rate. The Inn was clean, the rooms were very clean and comfortable. The cleaning staff and maintenance staff always had a smile and good word every day of our stay. I was so pleased with my stay that I will put La Quinta at the top of my list when I travel. Thank you to the Manager and Staff for making a difficult week so much easier for their great facility and caring.</p><br>Great stay<p>Staff was excelent from check in to check out. Room cleaning staff (2nd floor) was awsome and they actually had personalities, asked us if we needed anything and were very friendly.( In most hotels these folks usually avoid eye contact much less have a conversation with you.) The cont. breakfast was nice, kinda limited selection but what was there was always stocked, and again, friendly staff. If you're in town for a soccer tournament, this is the place to stay, close to Kellog and Betty Wilson complexes. Thanks, we had a great time!</p><br></body></html>
