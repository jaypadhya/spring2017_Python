<html><head><h3>La Quinta Inn & Suites Las Vegas Summerlin Tech Hotel Reviews Page 1</h3></head><body><br>Excellent Stay<p>Clean rooms, very friendly staff, safe area. I will stay here again. A real positive is there are NO gambling machines in this hotel and non-smoking so it's very family friendly. Fido is welcome and that is another major plus.</p><br>Vegas Trip<p>A very nice hotel if you are staying out near the tech center in Las Vegas. A bit of a drive to the strip though. Very clean and good value for the money. The breakfast menu was lacking in hot items. Most La Quinta's I have stayed at in the past had much better breakfast items.</p><br>bad odor<p>the rooms looked clean and nice but the sheets, pillows and rooms have a bad odor, not enough restroom supplies. it is hard to sleep with that uncomfortable smell. the breakfast area was so crowded that we couldn't seat to have breakfast.</p><br>Dogs Have Taken Over<p>Pet friendly, pet shabby. If you don't have pets you may not want to stay here. We have been staying at this hotel since it first opened, 10-15 years ago. It has steadily gone down hill over that time. Breakfast is just cold cereal or those awful waffles. Not much else.</p><br>Traditional La Quinta with super slow wifi<p>First the good news - Its a predictable La Quinta - if you have been in one, this one is just like them all. Also they are far enough from the strip they have have none of the nonsense Vegas resort fees, valet parking fee, minibar fee, had to handle your money fee, safe fee...none of that - amazing. it...
More </p><br>Convenient to Summerlin<p>We often stay in this hotel in Las Vegas, though it is not too convenient to the airport but for shopping in some of the new malls in Summerlin. It is also not too far driving distance from Las Vegas' Chinatown on Spring Mountain Road where we enjoy the Chinese and Vietnamese restaurants and shopping.</p><br>Friendly Service<p>This was a very clean hotel with friendly service. I would stay here again. The bed was extra comfortable. I appreciate having a microwave and refrigerator in the room. It was located close to the big Casinos in Summerlin.</p><br>Unexpected Stay<p>While visiting family, I had to go to emergency room and stayed in hospital 11 days. Hotel moved our room to close to the lobby so my husband did not have to walk far. They also kept extending our stay until I could get out of hospital and we could head home. Breakfast was very good according to my husband...

More </p><br>Pretty Nice<p>Good friendly staff, the most comfortable hotel bed I have had in a long while. The room was in good shape and clean, except some hairs in the bathroom. The breakfast is so so even for a continental breakfast. It is out of the way from the strip, but close to restaurants, stores ect. It is in a medical district,...
