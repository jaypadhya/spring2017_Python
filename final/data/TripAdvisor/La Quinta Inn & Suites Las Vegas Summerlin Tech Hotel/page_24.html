<html><head><h3>La Quinta Inn & Suites Las Vegas Summerlin Tech Hotel Reviews Page 24</h3></head><body><br>good motel<p>i recently had surgery at mt view hospital, la quinta gave my wife a hospital rate helped in every way thet could to make her stay good. she ate the breakfasts and had to stay five days. thank you .</p><br>I was impressed!<p>I couldn't believe the price for how nice it was. All the staff was nice and helpful. Some carpets in back halls a bit dirty. Bathroom very roomy. Overall ver impressed.</p><br>Stayed here twice and will probably do so again<p>I visit Vegas regularly to visit a friend and I find this hotel one of the best values. Each time I stay it is clean and quiet. Staff is both friendly and helpful without being overbearing. The La Quinta breakfast is predictable but in a good way. In the past I worried that the hotel had smoking rooms but I have never smelled smoke in the common areas and my rooms have always seemed completely smoke-free.

The location works well for where my friend is located but it is away from the usual tourist action of Vegas. For many that may be a downside but for me it is a plus.</p><br>RETURN STAY<p>Like betteer than staying at a casino.
Staff was cheerful and hotel is in a very quiet section. Though a little out of the way.</p><br>Oasis in Las Vegas<p>Want to stay at a nice place off the strip? Try the Summerlin Tech location. Quite location yet close to all services and only a few miles from the strip. Quite, clean and resonable cost makes this one a winner in Vegas baby!</p><br>EXCELLENT HOTEL<p>My husband and I stayed at five different LaQuinta Inn and Suites over a period of two weeks. We found each one to be very clean with friendly and helpful personnel. We will definitely try to locate a LaQuinta in future travels when a hotel is needed. The breakfast offered at each location had a variety of choices and was good food.</p><br>Clean hotel; nice area<p>If you want to stay off the strip and do not want to spend a fortune, you can't do much better than this location. Itâ€™s right off Highway 95, which takes you right down to the strip in about 10 minutes. Room was defiantly better than a lot of the rooms you find on the strip now and you even get free internet and a continental breakfast.
Room Tip: Use AAA card to save

We would definitely stay here again in the Summerlin area.</p><br>Las Vegas weekend<p>We have friends who live in this area of Vegas. Ive stayed on the strip so many times
that it was a pleasure to stay here. The hotel room was clean and that is very important
to us. Fremont St and the strip are just a few minutes away. So after a night of partying and cig smoke up your nose if you want a clean and relaxing place to stay this is it.
Kurtz Family Arizona..May 2012</p><br>Stellar hotel! Avoid Shilo Inn at Twin Falls Idaho.<p>One of the best hotel experiences ever. A welcome stay after the Twin Falls Idaho Shilo Inn (Shilo was the worst hotel experience ever. Some people on our floor were so unruly the police had to come. It was also extremely smokey). Choose your hotel wisely -- we highly recommend La Quinta!</p><br></body></html>
