<html><head><h3>La Quinta Inn & Suites Las Vegas Summerlin Tech Hotel Reviews Page 27</h3></head><body><br>Excellent overnight stop<p>We stayed at this hotel overnight on route to Bryce Canyon. It is located next to the interstate, but we weren't affected by noise. The room, a de-luxe king, was large, spacious, clean, and well equiped. There is a fitness centre, and pool. The wi-fi worked well, a bonus based on experience in othe US hotels this trip. The continental breakfast was fine, It is some way from the strip, but convenient for visiting Red Canyon. There are eateries nearby. An excellent choice if you require a stopover hotel around Las Vegas.</p><br>Great Hotel<p>We spent the night on our way to California. I usually try to avoid staying in Las Vegas but we decided that this hotel looked like a nice place to stay. We LOVED it. It is far from the strip, and for us that was great. It's right along a freeway but we didn't hear any of the noice. The area that the hotel is in is very nice. There are a lot of great restaurants near by. The front desk staff were great. Check in was a breeze. Our room was a nice size and very clean. The breakfast was ok. We lucked out and got a very good price on our room. We will for sure stay here again!!</p><br>Convenience at a reasonable price<p>Our one-night stay was part of a longer trip, so we were looking for convenient freeway access and close proximity to restaurants for dinner. We found both at this La Quinta. It's a newer property, so everything was clean and fresh-looking. Our limited exposure to the staff found them friendly and helpful.
The room - a "Deluxe King" - was large, nicely decorated and included a reclining chair, a good-sized desk, micro, fridge and coffee pot.. We found the bed to be comfortable.
"Convenience to the freeway" can also mean "noise from the freeway," but we found it to be minimal and it didn't disturb our sleep. The somewhat noisy AC posed more of a problem, but we managed to rest well in spite of it.
The included breakfast was served in a bright, airy room, but was limited to mostly cold items except for make-your-own waffles and a toaster oven for bagels, etc.
We would definityly return to this La Quinta.</p><br>Great Place<p>We were traveling and ended up here for 2 nights. They could not have been more pleasant.
Definately would stay here again>!</p><br>Great bargain - nice accomodations<p>We stayed for only one night, but I have to say the experience was great. The hotel is very clean and the staff was very helpful and friendly. We stayed in a suite, which had plenty of room. Being on a non-smoking floor was also a plus. Next time I visit Las Vegas, I will be sure to stay there. It's close enough to the strip, without all the hassles.</p><br>We both enjoy staying here!<p>I come to Vegas for business every 4-6 week and travel with my litlle "Bijou". The folks here are very friendly and accommadating. The rooms are clean and comfortable, with easy access. It's always a pleasure to stay there.</p><br>Great hotel<p>This is an extremely nice hotel. It is so nice that I have stayed there twice, visiting in 2009 and deciding to stay there again in 2010. While it may be more expensive than some of the hotels closer to the Strip, this hotel is very nice. The internet works very well and the rooms are of considerable size.</p><br>Nice hotel, good breakfast<p>I stayed only one night. The hotel is recent, the room was spacious (but no refrigerator or microwave, unfortunately), the area was quiet. Breakfast was of good quality and variety (self-baked waffles). Internet (free) is wired.</p><br>Great value, clean - 20 minutes from the strip.<p>We were pleased with this pet friendly hotel. The AAA rate was $75 and no pet fee, a great value for Vegas with a pup. It was a long way from the strip, 20-25 minutes drive - the nice thing is that the major hotels provide valet parking for a small tip - Caesar's has the easiest access.
The room and bedding were clean and comfortable. There is a laundry room available for a small fee. Although close to the highway, we did not find the rooms noisy at all. If traveling through Vegas with our pup again, we would stay here without hesitation.</p><br>Pet friendly, immaculate and reasonable<p>What a nice surprise after a long drive to find a motel in Las Vegas that is pet friendly (without a fee or deposit), clean and comfortable. The room was large and had everything we could want; microwave, frig, free internet and large desk. Will definitely use this as a stopover point next time we're driving though.</p><br></body></html>
