<html><head><h3>La Quinta Inn & Suites Las Vegas Summerlin Tech Hotel Reviews Page 18</h3></head><body><br>Yet another excellent stay!<p>I stayed here for 2 nights of a 33 night roadtrip and can only reitterate my previous reviews. Everything was excellent again, the staff are super-friendly (a couple of them even recognised me - hopefully not for the wrong reasons!), the room was quiet and clean, and I had a fridge this time which is a real bonus in summer in Vegas There's also a Trader Joe's (wish we had them in England!) a few minutes drive away, so you can stock the fridge with yummies and save on eating out costs. Breakfast was good - but I'm always happy with cereal and toast. Would I stay here for a fourth (or is it fifth?!) time? Absolutely YES!</p><br>Clean Hotel, great breakfast, reasonable rates<p>I will stay here again, nice people, clean rooms and great location. I also liked being next to 95 for easy access. We did not use the pool but it looked clean. Also had a place for exercise. The beds were very comfortable.</p><br>Stay in La Quinta<p>Upon returning to the U.S. and waiting to buy, we found La Quinta. They accepted pets, which was amazing since we had a cat with us. So many hotels now days are not pet friendly. The staff worked with me to find a place to park my trailer and ensured our room had a view of the trailer so we could keep an eye on it. Our stay was a month and the staff went out of their way to be nice and helpful. They faxed pages and pages of documents for me while I was arranging the house loan without any issue or charge. Could not ask for a better or more helpful staff. The rooms were clean, the morning breakfasts were awesome and included a variety of items not just the traditional coffee and prepackaged donuts.</p><br>Great Off the Strip Place to Stay<p>Traveling from Washington State to Phoenix, AZ and stopped in Las Vegas to visit with friends and of course visit a casino or two. The rates are very reasonable and the rooms a very clean and quiet and include a refrigerator, microwave and HD flat screen TV. The breakfast was very good serving waffles, cereal, fruit, toast, juices. This will be our Las Vegas stay place for our future trips to Las Vegas.</p><br>What a lovely place , just a bit out of the way<p>We returned to Vegas after going on a road trip to LA via Grand Canyon and Monument Valley then down to Flagstaff to drive along the old route 66, unfortunately we got back on a Friday and there was a top boxing match on and I am afraid we could not get a room anywhere, we were given a number to ring that gives you all the names of the hotel that have rooms and we could not believe we would end up some 15 mins drive away from the strip - but were were pleasantly surprised to be given this Hotel and the directions to it. We have to say that it did look like it had recently undergone a refit as our room looked very clean and the carpets were new but it was in a very nice and quiet area, there were plenty of eateries just around the corner back on the main road. They throw in a reasonable breakfast as well and all for $119 + tax we both thought it was a very good price to pay for the standard of room we had and we would both recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to be near vegas but just a short drive away, the added bonus is that the young man who booked us in was very nice and friendly and was very helpful when we arrived, as I have said you would go a long way for a good hotel and this is one of them.</p><br>Excellent stay<p>Friendly staff and great service and very happy with the hotel. Will definitely be back again. Me and my husband always enjoy the pools as this one was very spacious and got lucky with great sun that day as it was very warm.


Will always stay at this hotel anytime were visiting the Las Vegas strip. Thanks Laquinta Las Vegas</p><br>Two rooms<p>We rented two rooms on ground floor and they were very quiet and the beds were very comfortable. The bathroom was very bright and clean. The only issue we came across was the dust in the corners on the carpet. There was a good selection of TV channels and a variety of breakfast foods. The desk clerk was friendly and helpful.</p><br>Noise, noise, noise<p>I've always had good luck with La Quinta but this was the exception. The main problem is that apparently all their door closers allow the doors to just SLAM shut. So all you hear all the time until maybe the wee hours of the morning is....BAM...BAM....BAMM..BAM..BAM......BAM......BAM........BAM echoing all up and down the hallway. And when your neighbors come and go the entire room shakes. Such an easy fix yet they didn't seem to care. My air conditioner also only kept the room barely habitable. When asked if I wanted it service I told them NO...I'm leaving today. But before I did they proceeded to have some strange greasy maintenance man enter my room anyway, against my wishes, while I was away getting breakfast. I was going to stay several days but I left after one noisy night. Stay away if you value your sleep. I had a much better experience at the Airport North Location.
Room Tip: If you must stay here ask for a room far away from other occupied rooms.

There were a lot of guests staying that night, but we rarely heard anything. The breakfast was nothing special but great for our needs with juice, cereal, waffles, yogurt, hard boiled eggs, bagels, and of course, coffee. We would stay here again.</p><br>Great Location<p>From the beginning at checkin to checkout, everything was great. Staff was excellent and really took care of us during our time there. Everyone seemed to really enjoy being there and helping us have a good stay. Thank you</p><br></body></html>
