<html><head><h3>La Quinta Inn & Suites Las Vegas Summerlin Tech Hotel Reviews Page 22</h3></head><body><br>Relaxed and Ready<p>Having stayed in a wide variety of hotels, prices ranging from $85 to $350 a night, I find that the level of comfort and service experienced here rivals and in some cases surpasses any I have stayed in.</p><br>Clean and comfortable.<p>Great place to stay if you're driving though with a pet. The place is spotless and, for the price, you get a better than average room. If they upgrade the free breakfast, which is kind of on the thin side, it would rate 5 stars. Excellent value.</p><br>Nice overnite stay<p>Spent the evening of Oct 9, 2012 here, prices are very reasonable, staff very friendly, recognized my "Elite" status immediately, check-in was quick, overall appearance was clean and neat. Room was found to be very clean and presentable and well organized. Will definitely stay again when passing through Vegas. Easy access from Hwy 95 north or south.</p><br>Great place<p>This place was great and they let me keep my dog with me gave a military discount. The rooms were clean and the breakfast was very good and really helped out with the moring we left. Joe at the front desk was very helpful and was very friendly.</p><br>Reliable and Clean<p>If you don't need/want to be down on the strip, this is another example of the reliable, clean and well designed rooms that La qQuinta can offer. I've been in some La Quintas that haven't measured up, but this place does. Nothing fancy, but clean and comfortable rooms. The pool is pretty good and there are surprisingly good restaurants nearby. Just off the highway, but amazingly quiet.
Room Tip: ask for room away from the highway

Good location near restaurants and coffee, and easy access to hwy 95 North. Will definitely stay there again!</p><br>All I needed<p>I appreciate LaQuinta for their comfortable rooms since they include a refrig, coffee machine and microwave, breakfast, wiifii, pool and exercise room. Their employees at every encounter were there to help me no matter what my needs and they accomplished that as well as having made me feel so welcomed.</p><br>Travel stop from Oregon<p>Our best stay along the way and the Win 5 Cafe on N. Tenaya Way (just up the street) was a real plus for dining. This is a perfect stop when you have a pet (we have a small dog). It was a quiet area. The bed was extremely comfortable. The room was large. There was a small refrigerator and a microwave. Parking was close to the building with good lighting.</p><br>NIce place with execellent staff<p>I often stay at LQ and this is one of their better locations. It is a few miles from the Strip and in a calmer, cleaner, newer part of the city. The room was nice and the check-in person was extremely friendly and helpful. He assisted me with directions in the city and marked up a map for me to take. The overall experience there was very good.</p><br>Worst La Quinta Experience<p>First time experience at this La Quinta in Las Vegas on 9/12/12. We usually stay at the La Quinta Summerlin/Red Rock which is superb but getting very pricey. Summerlin Tech looks very nice from the outside and lobby area but inside the room is a totally different story. Our room had food on the floor, two chairs by the desk area that were so filthy and stained that we couldn't use them. The fridge had old sour cream sitting there, the coffee area had splashed coffee on the cabinet door. OK, the bathroom was deplorable. The water did not drain from the bathtub, the mirror was streaked and cloudy, the chrome spigot in the sink was untouchable, i.e., coated in a milky looking substance, the bathroom floor was sticky, 12 pane window in the room had forehead grease marks and hand forms on each pane. The worst thing of all was that the unscreened window in the room was able to be completely opened about 2 feet without any blocking. We were 5 floors up and the pane was at knee level. Any horrible situation could occur. I am sure that this window was not up to code. Oh yes, the bed was fine. The manager Arnold Needham handled this situation in an equally deplorable manner. Awful, just awful. Oh yes, very loud highway 95 noise. Very loud.
Room Tip: Choose another La Quinta.
