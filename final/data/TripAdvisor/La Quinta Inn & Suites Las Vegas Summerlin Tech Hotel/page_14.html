From start to finish everyone was so friendly and accommodating! All of our guests commented on how wonderful everything was! We would highly recommend this motel !</p><br>Linda<p>This was a great location for traveling with a dog. The dog day care is ~2 miles away and the fenced off leash dog park is~ 3 miles away from this LaQuinta. Our stay was quiet peaceful. We have a night light that we carry with us and it was great for the bathroom.</p><br>clean, comfortable hotel<p>Good value for a nice hotel. Check-in was a little slow with only one person at the desk, but otherwise a very pleasant stay. Don't know much about the location, stayed one night en route to the airport at the end of a vacation.</p><br>Quiet in Las Vegas<p>We stay at this LaQuinta since it is close to family who lives in the Summerlin area. The motel sits back from Tenaya St so one would have to really watch for it. The motel is located within a medical center type complex. The facility is very clean which is a priority for me! The breakfast variety is good. The bed was comfortable and I love down pillows. We have stayed here three times and this time had a room from which you could see the Stratosphere Casino/Hotel on the strip. The motel backs up to I-95 which is noisy if you have a room near it but closer to the front of the motel it wasn't an issue. I will stay here again and recommend it to others.</p><br>We'd Stay There Again<p>This is a great facility. Our room was absolutely spotless, very clean and neat. The bed was soft, the air conditioning worked great. The bathroom shower had great water pressure as did the toilet. It had plenty of mirrors, counter space and good lighting. There was a refrigerator in the room, a gym on site with several machines and a decent sized pool. The breakfast room was large and the food restocked frequently. Scrambled eggs would have been a nice touch since the breakfast was carb heavy but the hotel still rates a 5 with us and we'd stay there again.
Room Tip: We were on the ground floor, room 108. It was very quiet, close to the pool and breakfast area.

Not close to the strip but if you must go there it is not too far away. There is a lovely big heated pool and a nice large eating area for breakfast. No hot food available for breakfast other than waffles but the usual bread, muffins, boiled eggs, yoghurt, cereals etc. The hotel is poorly signed off main road although you can see it. However it is not clear which entrance to take to get there. It looks like you are entering the medical center entrance to get to the hotel. The room was very nicely decorated and the bathroom was large with double doors. The only odd thing was the TV was sideways to the bed which made viewing a bit awkward but not impossible, there was a sofa for optimum viewing of the TV.</p><br>Perfect for our visit<p>We were in town to visit our daughter, so the casino hotels were not the focus of our stay in Las Vegas. We were very comfortable and very pleased with this hotel. Close enough to the strip to go over for the evening, but far enough away to be out of the traffic for the rest of the visit. The staff was excellent and the room was great. We will stay here again when we return.</p><br>Happy with La Quinta<p>This hotel is worth the stay. The staff is wonderful and they maintain an excellent business. The only draw back is the usual breakfast the La Quinta has to offer. Its a bit far from the strip bu there are freeways all the way</p><br>cant wait to go back<p>the hotel was great with the exception for the housekeeper was rude. She was not happy that I asked for my mothers room to be cleaned everyday and argued about it. Asked for a new housekeeper and he was very helpfull. The front desk staff was wonderful also. Had a few great nights chatting with them. But there was a bald black man that hung around everynight in the lobby. Was also approached in the parking lot to get me to buy them. a room. The hotel desk clerk for the night did come out and chase them away.</p><br>In a Pinch, this place will do<p>I stayed at this property on April 8th, 2014. The woman at the front desk was really nice and helpful and got me into a room rather quickly. The room was in good condition and the bed was comfortable. This is a good property to stay at if you want to be away from the Casino crowds.

The shower water pressure was less than desirable but I have no other complaint than that and the price I paid for this room was $99 plus tax. In a pinch, I will probably stay here again.
Room Tip: I would recommend getting a room on a higher floor because dogs are allowed on the first floor.
