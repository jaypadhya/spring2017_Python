<html><head><h3>La Quinta Inn & Suites Las Vegas Summerlin Tech Hotel Reviews Page 10</h3></head><body><br>great place<p>we were visiting our elderly aunt in Del Webb's Sun City Summerlin. The hotel is about 5 miles away. Breakfast was adequate. The rooms were very big and had a microwave and a refrig. Bathrooms were very big. The staff was very attentive. Overall it was a great place to stay</p><br>Going downhill<p>I have stayed in this hotel many times and this time was thoroughly disappointed. the room was in poor shape from a maintenance stand point. Having been a support director for a school district I understand most of the Nevada requirements. The dog walk area was more like a jungle of weeds and trash.</p><br>Dog hotel<p>This hotel was clean and the staff very helpful and friendly. However, even though we love dogs we don't like eating breakfast with them. This hotel not only allows dogs on all floor levels, but they also come into the breakfast room. We watched as one dog stood counter high with nose sniffing as the owner got his food. This is not for people who believe dogs belong in the yard or at least in their rooms. Knowing that dogs are allowed on all floors means a room could have had a dog resident prior to your visit so beware if you happen to be allergic to dog or cat hair!</p><br>My Stays<p>My stay at this hotel is been quite good. Really no complaints, except fpr the breakfast, I would like to see a full breakfast. Otherwise I have been here off and on for about 2-3 months. Don't really have any complaints</p><br>Great for dog owner<p>Booked last minute. Looks nicer in pic but was ok. Doors are thin and you can hear people talking in their rooms. Carpets are pretty gross. Line at breakfast every day was too long to wait for a waffle. Very much a motel feel. A lot of dogs around so be prepared for some barking and a smelly elevator. Elevator is very slow and not air conditioned. Staff is very nice.</p><br>Great value in Summerlin area<p>I needed a good hotel near family in the Summerlin/northern Las Vegas area and La Quinta delivered, as usual. I like a quiet location when traveling and this loation certainly provided quiet. Don't blink or you will miss the access street to this hotel, signage is on the highway, but can't easily be seen from the surface streets.</p><br>La Quinta is GREAT<p>I appreciate the warm welcome and pet friendly environment of La Quinta; they are my favorite choice of hotels when I travel. Even though I don't usually travel with my dogs, every once in a while they come with me. There seems to be a caring and friendly disposition with pet owners and I like those I have had opportunity to chat with.</p><br>Surprised!<p>I had to make a quick decision the night before I drove into town. I found the hotel on-line. Reviews seemed satisfactory, the price seemed right. I was quite surprised, to say the least. The receptionist, and it was a very late arrival, was extremely pleasant. My room was extremely clean. At this price point, a room can be questionable. But, not in this case. It was great! I was starving, and a restaurant wasn't an option that late in the evening. I was traveling alone. So, I decided to give the "room service" a try. Mind you, this is an off-site service. I was nervous, but desperate. I was completely blown away by the food. And, I work in food so I am picky. The hamburger was large. The food was warm. The delivery guy was pleasant and quick. So, I am a fan. I don't know if I will ever need to drop in again, but I do recommend this hotel for a quick impromptu stay.</p><br>Great Value 2rms<p>This property was a good find location wise, near family and entertainment, shopping; 4 of 5 only 1rm drainage problem; Breakfast could be upgraded to compete. Otherwise good stay :-) Management did all they could to accommodate with what they had to work with in a short time frame, great Hospitality Attitude tho!</p><br>Our La Quinta stay in Nevada<p>Better than average accomodations; La Quinta does not try very hard to provide discounts to repeat customers: they told us that after 5 nights of stay we had earned about 1,100 points toward a free night, and that it required the accumulation of about 10,000 points to earn ONE free night. That comes to 45 fully-paid nights for ONE free night: 2% discount! A joke.</p><br></body></html>
