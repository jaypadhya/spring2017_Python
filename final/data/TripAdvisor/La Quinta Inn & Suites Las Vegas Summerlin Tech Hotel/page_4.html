<html><head><h3>La Quinta Inn & Suites Las Vegas Summerlin Tech Hotel Reviews Page 4</h3></head><body><br>New Favorite<p>Tried different LQ this trip (previous favorite just gone so far down, didn't even want to give it a try this year). Very pleasantly surprised, only negative: a little far from our usual fun spots. Easy access, though.</p><br>La Quinta overnight<p>Hotel is clean and comfortable with a decent hot breakfast. Usually cheap rate. Location on Highway 95 good for us--close to our daughter's house, but a ways from the strip our downtown--not a priority for us.</p><br>Great Stay<p>Quiet location, even though it is right next to the freeway. Freeway allowed easy access to and from the hotel. I recommend this hotel. breakfast items were as expected, which is always a plus for my daughter.</p><br>LaQuista Las Vegas - Summerlin, needs renovation<p>We stayed in the hotel when it was initially opened, it was a beautiful building. In staying in the hotel this weekend it felt like it was warn out: elevators - doors continue to close as you enter, leaky plumbing in the shower, sink stop - not working, heating/airconditioner - turns off at night when you are asleep, and a TV that struggles to change channels. While the breakfast provided is OK, other hotels have heated trays with freshly fried eggs, potatoes, and, chilled fruit. Sorry, this hotel does not meet the standards of the LaQuinta chain, or, other hotel chains.</p><br>Good place to stay in Summerlin/Las Vegas<p>Nice and comfortable hotel, good facilities (breakfast, pool, wifi, parking), friendly personnel, nice garden and outside settings. Best accessed with car, a bit far from Las Vegas Strip but with plenty of good restaurants nearby.</p><br>Nice place to stay<p>The location of this hotel is in a good area. Close to stores and Red Rock where I enjoy hiking. The hotel staff was friendly and courteous and the grounds are very pretty. A good place for my family to stay.</p><br>Not the best place I've ever stayed<p>Building was in good condition on the outside. Common area and reception area were also in good shape. Room was clean upon arrival but problems with housekeeping made getting the room cleaned sketchy after the first day. The bathtub was so disgusting I wouldn't wash my dog in it. (Note: they did state that they were planning to refinish those but time frame was also sketchy). The breakfast was the same every day and consisted of white bread, white bagels, muffins, cereal, fruit, hard boiled eggs and waffles.The wi-fi was free but it didn't have a password and my computer ended up with a virus.
Room Tip: Unless you have someone you are visiting in the hospital there are better places to stay.

Pet rooms should be in a designated area and marked as such. Appearance, grounds, were clean and well kept.</p><br>Noisy with not much for breakfast<p>Let me start by saying the hotel looks nice.. There's a pool and nice lobby; and the rooms are decent on par with Holiday Inn Express. Now for the structural issues- This particular La Quinta was.. NOISY! I think all rooms had some sort of noise issue (I tried no less than 3). It was either clanking from elevators; dogs barking in adjacent rooms; or freeway noise. The breakfast was also lacking; consisting only of packaged oatmeal; waffles; and cheap cereal. No dice for protein like eggs; bacon; yogurt or anything else that might make for a breakfast with nutrition and holding power. That I assume is systemic with all La Quintas..</p><br>good location nice place<p>good location-several food venues, nice place and safe, staff friendly, room nice and roomy, dog walking areas nice with lawn, great on off freeway and gas access, pool and gym good with outside sitting</p><br></body></html>
