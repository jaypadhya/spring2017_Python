<html><head><h3>La Quinta Inn & Suites Las Vegas Summerlin Tech Hotel Reviews Page 5</h3></head><body><br>I experienced several problems<p>I experienced several problems: Mattress was sagging in the middle Tub was in bad shape Problem with door cardkey / lock, it would work / not work Worst of all, the drain in sink was backing up, sink would get filled with sewer water</p><br>Rest between medical procedures<p>All I needed was a hotel close to the medical center, since I would be groggy after my early morning procedure. They satisfied my request for an early check in, and it was a very nice looking hotel with courteous personnel. Very comfy bed. The continental breakfast the next morning was a big help too, before my second procedure.
My only problem with this place was that there was a soiled pillow case still in use on the bed, and I never got my wake up call. Luckily I had my phone alarm set. I filled out their online survey, alerted them to my 2 issues, and they refunded half of my room cost. I will book this hotel again, if I need a hotel in this area of Las Vegas.</p><br>A breath of Fresh Air<p>After spending 3 nights in the Planet Hollywood for a convention and dealing with poor service AND having them overcharge my card for almost 500 bucks, the La Quinta was a breath of fresh air. The price quoted was the price charged. No extra fees. The staff was friendly and courteous. There was a coffee pot, a microwave, AND a fridge in the room. And when we checked out we heard the desk clerk on the phone requesting a customer call her back so she could make sure he or she was NOT being overcharged. It made me smile.</p><br>Fun Stay at the La Quinta Inn<p>We stayed at this La Quinta Inn with our Reed High School Baseball team during a big high school tournament. This hotel had friendly staff and the manager Jeramy went out of his way to accomodate us with anything we needed. The hotel rooms were clean and comfortable...a nice gazebo by the pool was great for relaxing after the games. I would recommend this hotel to my family and friends any time they are staying in the Las Vegas area!</p><br>Pleasant curb appeal<p>A good location for a quick overnight stop. This LaQuinta has had a face-lift and our room was one. Do request a quiet room and not the rooms at the end of the halls near the highway! The breakfast area is light and cheerful. Staff professional.</p><br>Nice motel on the north side of Las Vegas!<p>We have stayed at this motel for several years. It is always quiet, clean, and friendly. This year we did see a decline in the quality of breakfast. There was not as much to choose from, and the coffee was very tasteless. The grounds around the hotel were in much need of a clean up - lots of weeds and debris.</p><br>Shower Sucks<p>If I'm going to spend $159.00 a night. at the very lease, please make an attempt to clean the Bathrooms. It would also be Nice if somebody actually checked to make sure the customers are 100% Happy with their room!!!</p><br>Very old hotel<p>I am sorry to say but this hotel is new need of updating. hallway carpets were soiled,
furnishings were in back in the 90's. I felt that this place is an after thought hotel, it seems that no one in management was even around. The next time I come to summerlin, nv I will look for something more like a Hampton inn.
I will say at least one thing was good, was the bedding it was the highlight of this room.</p><br>OK for the price<p>Price was the best we could find for a weekend tournament. Beds were small with double rather than queen size. Tub drain did not drain while showering. Breakfast was not that great. Over billed for an additional night. Friendly staff.</p><br>Good Beds, Poor Wifi, Stained Tub<p>Stayed here for 3 nights March 5-7. Friendly staff, comfortable beds, rooms are quiet enough for a good nights sleep. We greatly enjoyed the outdoor Jacuzzi and pool. The two biggest changes this hotel could make would be to 1. Refinish the bathtub as it appears very dirty which makes it quite unappealing to stand in. 2. Increase WiFi speed as the speed was so slow that we couldn't access websites and the one computer in the lobby is also painfully slow. You would not want to be a business traveler in this hotel. My travel friends wished that they served eggs or other hot items for breakfast, but they did have a waffle maker. I wished that they offered washable plates/bowls rather than disposable styrofoam plates/bowl.
Room Tip: 5th floor had nice views.
