Room did not smell of pets but some interesting spots on the carpet. Would stay there again if in the area. Usually stay on the strip but this was a nice change away from the madding crowd. Only 10 minutes to the strip and 10 minutes to other casino's not on the strip.
Room Tip: Top floor either side to see mountains, downtown lights and highway.

Definitely would recommend this Hotel to anyone staying on the area and wanting a good place to spend the night.</p><br>Clean the Carpet for goodness sake !<p>If you have a pet, your choices are limited. This Motel allows them . The side entry carpet has been filthy for the years I have been coming here. I tell the staff but this does no good, it is never clean. It is disguesting. Otherwise the motel is O.K. to good. Expect to have to go elsewhere for breakfast, this one is minimal, the apples are horsey food.</p><br>animal friendly<p>Average to very good. Rooms have always been clean and hotel is close to freeway and near restaurants. More choices in the breakfast room would be nice. We started using La Quinta mainly because it is pet friendly and do not charge for pets. Customers at ALL properties need to clean up after there pets, not leave it to the help.</p><br>La Quinta Summerlin Tech<p>I recently stayed at the La Quinta Summerlin Tech in Las Vegas, NV. It is located near Mountain View Hospital and other medical centers. The 95 freeway is a block a way. the closest exit is Cheyenne . There are restaurant's , a Post Office , A Target and gas stations nearby with in a few blocks form the hotel. The pool area is very nice. There is a small gym on site as well. The breakfast is continental style and it is served in the spacious lobby area across from the front desk. The staff is very friendly and alert to service. The parking is free. The rooms are very comfortable and clean. I would stay at this location again.</p><br>Reservations<p>I reserved a handicap accessible room back in April of 2015. Two days before I am to check into the hotel I get a phone call from the place to see if I really needed a handicap room because all of their handicap rooms are under construction and they have been that was since the beginning of August!!!</p><br>Great place to stay when traveling with pets.<p>Having stayed at several La Quinta hotels in multiple locations, I'm always impressed at how clean and comfortable they are, and how they welcome travelers with pets. La Quinta is one of very few hotels that doesn't charge extra pet fees or put you in a nasty "pet room" that smells of urine and hasn't had the carpet cleaned in ages - you pet owners know what I'm talking about. You also get a nice breakfast with your stay, though I'm recommending they offer more whole grain bread and waffle choices. Kudos La Quinta!</p><br>Nice place to stay<p>This is the second time I stayed at this location and will be back again. Hotel staff are courteous and friendly and were great on meeting my needs. I felt safe staying here and the room was clean. Close to Red Rock and Mount Charleston. Away from the hustle and bustle of the strip but close enough to drive there for a visit.</p><br>Welcome to Hawaii-Even though we are in Vegas!<p>First time at this beautiful location and 2nd time in Vegas. The first time ever was in June 2015. We were so impressed with the city, the people and the food, we decided to move to Vegas on a whim! Hey Now! Life is short and we are old and did not plan out our stay in advance. We just wanted out of Boston ASAP, no more snow up to our front door!! Yes I was able to book the room by using my cell phone number and no credit card info. I was very impressed. Once I arrived I provided my payment info. The clerk@the desk was so nice I had to ask her where is she from - Hawaii, I so enjoyed her great attitude and spirit. I ended up staying 2 extra days. The breakfast was clean, good and fresh. There is a mall right across the interstate with Walmart, Wendy's, Best Buy, Chili's. Everything that you want. I finally got a good nights sleep on the comfortable beds int he room. Its non smoking, has a beautiful view, great service, good food. I cannot ask for anymore from La Quinta. I am extremely satisfied. Will come again for a romantic getaway.</p><br>LQ North Las Vegas - A Great Secret<p>The LQ Inn and Suites at Summerlin Tech is a great secret for visitors to Vegas to learn about. It is about 9 miles from the Stripe but an easy commute. Pleasant rooms, quiet, nice breakfast, pleasant staff, and clean. It is also 100 % smoke free! Parking is easy and there is plenty of it. It is not a resort but you can work out, work on that tan, and lounge. A good bargain.</p><br></body></html>
