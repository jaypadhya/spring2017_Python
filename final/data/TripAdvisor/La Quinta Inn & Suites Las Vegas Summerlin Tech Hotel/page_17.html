<html><head><h3>La Quinta Inn & Suites Las Vegas Summerlin Tech Hotel Reviews Page 17</h3></head><body><br>Clean and comfortable<p>Came to Vegas again for Christmas with family living in town. This hotel was close to their home, away from the Strip, so we stayed again. Clean, comfortable, reasonably priced, nice continental breakfast helps with expenses. Was a pleasant stay.</p><br>Great place to stay for business trip<p>I always stay here when I have business in Las Vegas. I used to stay on the strip but when you come to vegas often for work the strip gets old.

Always great customer service here. Ive never had a bad experience with the staff here.

Very safe location, ive been staying here for over 5 years and never seen or heard of any issues of it being unsafe. The hotel is located at an end of a culde sac in between a large business and another hotel.

Parking is always great here this hotel never seems too too busy so theres always parking.

The rooms are always pretty clean along with the bathrooms as well.

I have no complaints of this LQ. Its a pretty good spot.</p><br>Excellent customer service<p>I can go on and on. This is my first stay at a LA Quinta and it was fabulous. From the time I made my reservation to the time I left. When I arrived the front desk lady remember my name from my reservation and asked about my drive. The room was so comfortable and amazing. Plus it is so homey and comfortable. I will definitely stay more at LA Quintas for business.</p><br>Great stay in LV<p>Off the hustle and bustle of the strip, yet convenient to restaurants and other services. Easy to get to the strip or other LV attractions. Clean and quiet, with a great desk and housekeeping staff. Liked the refrigerator, coffee pot, and microwave in the room and the breakfast bar. Great value - our choice for Vegas stay</p><br>Enjoyed Both Stays<p>We've stayed here twice...we were in town for a wedding each time, and this was close to the wedding family home. Our experience both times were good. Had clean large rooms, good maid service when needed. Great breakfast in the mornings. Nice atmosphere if one needs to just kick back for a time. Would stay here again, no problem</p><br>Good Trip<p>Have stay here a number of times and all have been good. No complaints, except for the owners of pets that do not pick up after them. No reflection on La Quinta, because they did when the owners did not!</p><br>Not a good one<p>This hotel didn't justify the price. This is not on the strip, has no refrigerator, no lock on bathroom door, and full size beds that replace the traditional queen. My husband and I couldn't even move in the bed. The elevator took 5 to 10 minutes every time to get to ground level, and it just stunk literally. I'm not a picky person and this was bad enough that I will never go there again.</p><br>GREAT SERVICE!!<p>This hotel was a great choice for my Vegas trip. Close to everything and reasonable. Best waffles in Nevada! Clean and quiet. I will be back soon. Keep up the good work. Had to change my arrival dates three times. The front desk handled everything without a problem.</p><br>Quiet, clean but a little far from town<p>This is a typical American hotel where the service is excellent, the rooms are large and clean and nothing is too much trouble.

Free WiFi, free coffee and a decent pool (coupled with the sun) make this a nice base for a trip around the city that never sleeps.

They do provide breakfast but it is very limited (great if you like waffles, toast and cereal) but that's about it.

Room service is provided from outside the hotel, not all that healthy but OK.

It is, however, quite a way from the strip and cabs are both expensive and unpleasant. Be prepared to pay about $100 for a round trip. But that is not the worse part, more often than not the cab drivers don't know the way and they expect you to either use your phone so that they can call and obtain directions, or worse have you use your sat nav. and the navigate them to the hotel.

This aside, a good venue and I have no hesitation recommending it as a place to stay.</p><br>Excellent... Quiet... Helpful staff... Good location away from strip<p>Great stay... Would choose this place again . We did not eat at the hotel. Asked for a quiet room on top floor and they gladly changed the reservation. Close to lots of good shopping and miles easy from the strip:)</p><br></body></html>
