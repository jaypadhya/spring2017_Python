<html><head><h3>La Quinta Inn & Suites Las Vegas Summerlin Tech Hotel Reviews Page 9</h3></head><body><br>Back again<p>We stay here because of the included breakfast, excellent service, good value as well as the easy access/proximity to our daugthers family home. We stay here several times a year and keep coming back. We are confindent that if we have an issue with the accomodation it will be handled to our satisfaction.</p><br>Worst place to ever stay in<p>More pets than people. Non smoking rooms had been smoked in. Complete bad experence Go somewhere else. This is thew whorst hotel in Las Vegas will stay some where else next time have kids and grand kids in the area thought this would be nice and close was not worth the decision.</p><br>Vegas stay<p>Overall things were fine. Just would have preferred a better breakfast menu and availability. The room was pleasant and the pool was nice and clean with not too many people. We have a small dog and the grass was kept clean so not unpleasant to walk her and bags were provided to take care of any "remains".</p><br>we're done!<p>we have stayed at this property many times but no more. the bath tub was in poor repair and very dangerous and slippery. the smoke alarm started going off around midnight and continued every 15 minutes for the rest of the night. the swimming pool appeared to not be heated and was uncomfortable. the radio alarm came on at maximum volume at about 2 in the morning. we will not be using La Quinta anytime soon.</p><br>Stay at La Quinta Las Vegas<p>The room was very nice and clean. We would stay there again. The first room smelled like smoke the clerk gave us another room on another floor which was excellent. It was also located in a good location, close to stores and eating places.</p><br>Hotel that takes pets.<p>Clean and comfortable and takes animals. Could use a larger selection of breakfast choices. They do the minimum. Other LQs do a better breakfast. We will stay again. Non smoking room smeled like smoke and we were given another room. Hotle staff should have picked up on this. First floor carpets show stains and need cleaning.</p><br>My Dogs felt right at hom.<p>I had to travel with my dogs, and it was absolutely amazing they felt right at home... This gave us a bright brand new and fresh start without any headaches or worries how to keep our family intact during the transition. Thank you so very much.</p><br>There for a funeral<p>This hotel and the suggestion where to eat exceeded our expectations. When you stay at this hotel, you should check out Wine 5 Cafe. It is very close to this hotel. Our visit to both this hotel and this Cafe made a sad occasion, a memorable one instead.</p><br>Convenient Location<p>This appears to be an older property and could use some minor maintenance/touch-ups. Beds not real comfortable but location is quiet. Did not use the pool or spa; however, looking at the spa from my room it did not look appealing. Either needs a good cleaning or resurfacing.</p><br>Very Nice<p>Clean safe. If I had anything bad to say its the TV's aren't big enough & breakfast was not that good... Very nice hotel.. Will stay here again.. Love that its dog friendly... The service wasvery good. Clean beds.. Had to ask for extra towels ..not a big deal.. I ask for a 1st floor room & the desk clerk gave me what I wanted...</p><br></body></html>
