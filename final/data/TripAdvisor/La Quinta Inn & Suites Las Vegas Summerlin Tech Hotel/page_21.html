One highly appreciated detail is a four socket electrical socket that is located above the night table on each side of the bed with enough receptacles for several devices to be charged overnight. No crawling on the floor or moving furniture required. The bed was extremely comfortable, with nicely fitted sheets and a washable coverlet tucked over a white comforter. No disgusting common use bedspread here! The room is relentlessly clean and well appointed, with a large TV. There is a Keurig coffee maker in the room, and a free continental breakfast with many choices.

It's also 100% non smoking, and they serve fresh cookies at check-in. What's not to love? We will definitely stay here again the next time we need to visit Vegas.</p><br>Great place to stay, eat breakfast elsewhere<p>This is a great hotel if you have pets traveling with you. We had a first floor room that was close to the back entrance for those quick visits out. I know there were other dogs there but it was not noisy at all. The staff were very pleasant and helpful. We did have a few issues with the room but they were resolved quickly. The only down side was the breakfast. Not much variety, the coffee area did not look clean and there were children playing with the waffle maker (don't know where their parents were). So we ate breakfast elsewhere.</p><br>Several rough spots in a bad road<p>The short of it is that housekeeping "forgot" to clean my room on 2 separate days. The front desk was at best indifferent to the problem, ( no clean towels no offer to get some, that sort of thing) all but said it was my fault and called me a liar. This is a hotel to stay away from due to cleanliness and customer service. They are far away from it all on the strip and need to do a better job, just not the case here</p><br>Just okay.<p>I am a fan of La Quintaâ€™s but this one did not really win me over. I think it just needs a renovation. The check in was simple and easy and the front desk agents were friendly. When we walked on our floor, we smelled smoke, but we asked for a nonsmoking room. The room didn't smell like smoke so that was good. We got a king suite with a kitchenette. The suite was a good size but the kitchenette was outdated and in a very small area. The bed was comfy and we had a good night sleep. The location is really good; it is right next to Mountain View Hospital, a Target, a few restaurants and is right off the main freeway. The breakfast seemed fine; it had the usual self-make waffles, toast, juice and hard boiled eggs. I would recommend this place for someone visiting a person in the hospital.</p><br>Surprisingly disappointed<p>For the past 4 years my wife and I have stayed at this hotel when we travel between Arizona and the Oregon coast. This property has had all the makings for a good stay. Location, restaurants, good parking, pet friendly, clean comfortable rooms and a pleasant pool/hot tub area. Our latest stay on Nov. 1, 2011 was a disappointment. Although our room was clean and comfortable the dirty appearance of the halls, elevator and common areas was enough for us to look for a different hotel in the spring. I almost asked the front desk is there was a change of ownership. The difference was disappointing.</p><br>Another very nice La Quinta<p>This one of the better La quinta's the check inn was slow as we arrived 1 hour early early and they could not find a room for us this took a good 20+ minutes. The room was supposed to a king delux with fridge and microwave but again!!!! we got a two double's with no fridge or microwave but its only a one night stay before we move to the strip and since when I booked months ahead I got a great rate. I recieved nothing for the down grade. The rates at all La quinta's change daily so at $56.00 a night you cant realy complain. The room is a good sized room on the second floor, some freeway noise if you open the window, flat screen tv, basic channels, large bathroom and only hotel clean again the extra cleaning is not done so you will see some wall dirt,finger prints a good wash down of rooms,door frames would be great but hotel maids dont realy clean just make up and vacum wipe down counters,sinks,toilets but never wash a wall or door frame.Pet friendly is a plus, nice grounds in a safe area a few resturants in the area but nothing we seen was with in walking distance. we would stay again</p><br>Excellent Stay<p>This was my first experience with La Quinta and I must say it exceeded my expectations. It had the highest quality of cleaniness, friendliness and was overall efficient in every way. From the the friendly employees to the great breakfast every phase of my stay perfect in every way. The staff was so friendly and helpful as was the maintenance and house keeping personnel. Their attitude was "you want it, you got it" and always with a smile on their face. Very, very nice people! I totally enjoyed my stay. Thank you La Quinta!</p><br>Nice Stay.<p>Nice stay. Good service at front desk. Got my money's worth. Decent Location: Safe area, can walk to restaurants, bus service right in front of motel. The price was right. Breakfast was decent but for a full breakfast IHOP was a stone's throw away.</p><br>Quite a nice experience~!<p>I've lived in Vegas, and stayed in Vegas numerous times, and I can say unless you're staying on the Strip in a mega hotel, you're not going to find a better room, with better service for a better price! There must have been something in town the weekend that we went, because the rates for the resorts and the casinos was extreme! In the end, for just a weekend trip, we decided that all we needed was a place to sleep, we could deal with the rest. Well, this was more than that- the room was large and clean, the staff was very friendly, and the lobby smelled sweetly of baking waffles when we went down for breakfast. I'll definitely stay again! Right in the area of town that we needed to be in.</p><br></body></html>
