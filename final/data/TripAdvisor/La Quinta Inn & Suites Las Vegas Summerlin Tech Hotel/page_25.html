<html><head><h3>La Quinta Inn & Suites Las Vegas Summerlin Tech Hotel Reviews Page 25</h3></head><body><br>great hotel, nice large rooms!<p>We were surprised how big the rooms were compared to other same-priced hotels! Joe at the front desk was very happy and friendly. Our room was very clean, beds were very clean :) Breakfast was great. (the only thing missing was banana's) They also keep ice water with lemon in the lobby during the day! Perfect refreshment after lounging by the pool!</p><br>La Quinta all the way<p>La Quinta was a great choice..went all the way across the united states and stayed at La Quinta all the way through except first night...that was a nightmare..from that day forward only stayed at La Quinta..always able to get a room on short notice since we didn't know where we would be along our travels. And they always accepted our dog who was our traveling companion...always pleasant and I liked the fact that check out was at noon so we didn't have to rush to get out...would definitely recommend to everyone.</p><br>Pet friendly BUT...<p>Far from everything! Not worth the price. The pool water was GREEN, the 1st few feet out of the elevator we were greeted with the scent of cigarette smokers rooms. Only true plus was we could bring our 100+ lb Akita. Did I mention FAR FROM EVERYTHING!</p><br>Great place with convenient location<p>We stayed here recently for only one night, but we would definitely come back. The room was clean and comfortable with stylish amenities like a mirror and shelf in the entryway. There was a large TV, a great breakfast, and we were greeted in a very friendly manner when we arrived. There was plenty of room in a two-bedded guest room for us, and we slept well on comfortable beds. The free WiFi was convenient, as was the desk with plug-ins. There were many, many dining options about a mile or so from the motel, too many to list here, but several major national chains of restaurants and fast food. It is conveniently located very close to a hospital. The only thing I wished we'd had was a mini-fridge. Otherwise, this place had everything we needed at a great price.</p><br>spring vacation with grandkids<p>Joe was on the desk and checked us in. We saw him quite a bit during our stay and he had a smile on his face, was friendly with my granddaughter, and helpful when we needed things.</p><br>Stayed two weeks and enjoyed the stay!<p>I was in the area for a work detail for two weeks. I worked night shift and slept in the daytime, and had no major issues! Some other guests were a pain, but that's not on the hotel! A great convienent place along hwy 95. It's nearby a great local brewery too!</p><br>Didn't meet my expectations...<p>My mom, son, and myself stayed at this hotel in September. We were originally going to stay for two nights, but only ended up staying for one. The toilet in our first room continuously ran and our second room was less than clean. The front desk still ended up charging me for two nights, even though I had let them know on our first night, that we would not be staying another night. I ended up having to call and get the other night refunded back to my account. The Breakfast area was really busy and it seems that one person was not enough to deal with the mess. All the trash cans were overflowing as well. Usually I have really good luck with La Quinta, but this one did not seem up to the normal standard. The bathroom in the room was really unclean and I didn't even feel comfortable giving my son a bath in the tub. Overall, I wouldn't stay there again knowing that there are other hotels in the area to stay at.</p><br>Luxury at a Reasonable Price<p>I stay in Las Vegas to go to Death Valley or Red Rock Canyon, so this great hotel on the west side has an awesome location. The pool is open 24 hours and the queen suite I stayed in (their smallest room) was luxurious and roomy and clean. Breakfast was good (waffles) and the desk help was generous and helpful and accomodated a late check out. There are lots of good restaurants around and only a few minutes from Red Rock Canyon. I was unusually impressed with this place and would make a point of returning again. The price was surprisingly reasonable.
Room Tip: An upper floor overlooking the pool is best.

Breakfast was limited to wafftles, cold cereal, toast/bagels and muffins. They have a nice outdoor area. The place was clean, but the elevator could use a cleaning. I didn't see any trash in the halls or outdoors. There are alot of restaurants and fast foods within a few minutes drive. As much as I travel, I will be back.
Room Tip: Hangers were very limited, not sure it was just my room. Ladies, make sure to bring shampoo and con...

We really like this establishment as they allow pets to stay with no hassles. Also their breakfast was better than most other hotels.
Room Tip: Excellent quality at a reasonable price.
