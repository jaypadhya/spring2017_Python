<html><head><h3>La Quinta Inn & Suites Las Vegas Summerlin Tech Hotel Reviews Page 12</h3></head><body><br>customer service<p>customer service is not that loyal left my I pad charger and went through 2 people and got the run around and still haven't received a call back letting me know if they found it or not. I just went out and bought another one too much stress</p><br>A FIRST<p>This has been the first time I have slept in a motel that was more like a sleeping in a kennel with very large dogs in every room and apparently no sound deadening. Our dog is a little one.
Then to add insult to injury, it was the only place on our trip that I gave my drivers license and credit card to register (my wife did the others) and apparently only got my credit card back. Four days later when I need to present my drivers license, lo and behold no drivers license. When we called about it; we'll check, etc. good luck. Obviously have no proof but 1+1 =2. TripAdvisor will get the same comments.</p><br>Great Dog Friendly Hotel!<p>Staff was friendly, breakfast very good, this is a dog friendly hotel and the rooms were spacious for my kennels and dog gear with room to spare for me to move around in. Very clean and nice grounds with grass for my dogs. Rooms were good for noise control too. I would recommend this to anyone traveling with a dog(s)</p><br>Very Impressed<p>This was a refreshing stay compared to previous La Quinta's on our trip. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. They really made us feel like we were welcome. The motel is very clean and well maintained. The room was comfortable and the bedding was great. Breakfast area was well maintained and clean. Great location off the strip but easy access to downtown about 15 minutes away. We stayed for 2 nights and will definitely stay again.</p><br>a pleasure<p>Excellent in every way....thank you La Q !!!! This was a very difficult time for me and the staff went out of there way to be helpful .... the best in excellence.... i will make this la q my go to when i a m in town</p><br>Good La Quinta<p>Stayed here for a wedding. We stay at La Quintas often. This one was fine. Not the best I have stayed at but not the worst either. Would stay here again no problem. Traveled with My wife, three teenage kids. Also traveling was my sister and her son, and my nephew and his young family.

Breakfast was standard La Quinta. Waffle machine, toast, muffin etc... Nothing special.

The only think wrong with the room was:
1. The door would stick when opening. Had to hit it with your shoulder to get it open.
2. The tub had a slow drain. It drained eventually but was kind of concerning knowing hotel rooms.
3. At some time in the past they had put a mat in the tub. It is now gone. It looked dingy with it gone.
Room Tip: Had rooms in our group on the 4th floor facing both the pool and the road. Both were quiet.

Breakfast was standard, nothing unusual. Were I to travel in the area again I would likely be staying there again.</p><br>Pleasantly surprised<p>I stayed 3 nights at the La Quinta Sumerlin and was pleasantly surprised. The hotel was very nicely appointed and the rooms were spacious and comfortable. Enjoyed the pool at night. Only problem I experienced was spotty internet connection but would stay there again if in the area.</p><br>Dog friendly value and clean<p>One sometimes has to sacrifice cleanliness for dog friendly but no compromise needed here. Friendly staff very accommodating to special requests for extra blanket, snacks to help down meds and a slightly balky door lock (have to pull handle up rather than down). Nice looking pool and spa. Off strip near Summerlin tech centet but convenient to west side casinos like Red Rock.</p><br>La Quinta is always a good choice<p>Great Continental breakfast, great comfortable rooms, great hotel staff, and great price. What more would you want in a hotel on a budget. Had 4 people with me in a room with 2 beds with good air conditioning, and we all have no complaints.</p><br></body></html>
