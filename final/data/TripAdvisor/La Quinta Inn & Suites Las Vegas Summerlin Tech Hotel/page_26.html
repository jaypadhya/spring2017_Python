<html><head><h3>La Quinta Inn & Suites Las Vegas Summerlin Tech Hotel Reviews Page 26</h3></head><body><br>Could Use Some Improvements<p>We stayed at and enjoyed this hotel a few years ago, but in our opinion it has declined considerably.
First impressions were not great at the dirty and littered side entrance we used to bring our luggage in (it remained that way for our 2 day stay). The hallway on our floor was unbelievably littered with everything from chewing gum wads and wrappers to silly string and more. The breakfast area tables were sticky and dirty and the counters where the food was kept covered in beverage ,cereal and waffle dough spills.
Suprisingly (after all this) our room was clean enough and a good size. But we had a major concern on our first day when we returned from a 4 hour outing to find our closed and locked room unlocked with the door ajar about 6 inches!! After ensuring our laptop and other items were intact and seeing the room had been cleaned and restocked, we called the front desk who, to their credit, expressed concern and did make a gesture of taking $20 off our bill. The cleaner, who was several rooms away, came to say she had left our room open as she had not cleaned our bathroom floor but then forgot!
This hotel seemed to lack a caring, well trained and supervised staff and we will look elsewhere on our next visit to Las Vegas.
Room Tip: It is very near a freeway so light sleepers may want a room at the far end away from it.

I noted the cleanliness was not up to par. The hallway had not been vacumed in two days (same litter was on the floor), the coffee pot in our room had an old used filter in it and the pot had not been cleaned.
The breakfast bar had a good variety however the spills from the waffle maker were not being cleaned up, had to wipe off a table in order to eat. The person attending to the breakfast area was hustling the patrons around but not maintaining order.
Cleanliness needs to rank #1!
The rest of our room was clean and neat.</p><br>Pet Friendly<p>We were on a medical trip for surgery. We stay at LQ as they take pets. The staff was most accommodating. Plenty of easy access to rooms and staff willing to haul luggage. Just ask them for assistance. Conti breakfast was adequate and fresh. Inside of bathroom needed some caulking on the tub but it was at least clean and mold free. Beds fresh and room cleaned daily unless you specify otherwise. The gym for workout was great for minor exercise I needed. This LQ is well laid out the location makes for easy access to the city or the outskirts for sightseeing.
Located away from the major strip, this LQ assures a quiet night of rest.
Room Tip: If you have a specific need, let them know ahead in advance. If you want a room preference, say next...
See more room tips</p><br>Pleasantly surprised<p>We stayed for one night with our pet (at no extra charge) had a nice king size bed which was very comfortable. We decided that we had had enough driving for one day and ordered from the restaurant menu that was in the room. The food was great and not to expensive. The breakfast next morning was laid out well and very appetizing. Nice way to start the day. Would definitely stay here again.</p><br>Needs Updating<p>Looks nice from the outside however on the inside is a different story. Old and out dated rooms. The tubs were rusted and dirty. Hallway and Elevators were also very dirty like it has not been cleaned in a while wrappers and papers on the floors. The postive is the employees are very nice and helpful. I would not stay here again. Pick the La Qunita by the Airport or Red Rock 100% better picks.</p><br>Excellent all round...<p>I stayed here for seven nights of a 39 night road trip.

Convenient location about ten miles from the Strip - it's easy to drive into town (and park at any of the big hotels for free) but also easy to get out of town if you have a car and want to explore further afield (e.g. Death Valley, Area 51, Mount Charleston).

I had a room on the fifth floor - it was quiet, spotlessly clean and comfortable.

The staff were extremely pleasant and helpful, especially when a tour company made a glaring error with the location I'd given them (despite me giving them the full address!!) and went to the wrong hotel. Be warned about this - if you want to go on a planned tour, park in town and get them to pick you up at one of the Strip hotels. Luckily it was all sorted out and I went the following day.

Breakfast was the usual cereal, toast & waffles - although the fresh fruit salad went down particularly well.

An enjoyable stay - many thanks...</p><br>Nice Enough<p>This is an okay place, esp. if you have a pet (they take pets free, no pet deposit). The first floor is for pets only. If you want a restful time, you may want to ask for a room that does not face the pool. It can get a bit noisy depending. Pool area is very nice and clean, spa is roomy and well maintained. Be aware that between Aug 3-Aug 13 this hotel is upgrading all the rooms to have flat screen t.v's, so maintenance workers may knock on the door or need to get in to do the work. Pet peeve is that hotels don't post the dates of these projects on their websites so guests will know ahead of time. It will be nice when they get all the flat screens in, but it may be a bit of a hassle if you don't want to be interrupted (they say it will take 30-40 min. per room to do the t.v. installation).
I agree with the other poster about the closet door type bathroom door - never seen that before, bit of a nuisance. No big deal, but would prefer a standard door. Bathroom was well maintained, clean. Rooms on the other side facing the freeway may pick up some noise, depending on room location. In later evening hours, traffic noise dies out so it may or may not be an issue for you. Complimentary breakfast was the standard things(available 6am to 9 am), consisted of waffle maker, cornflakes, some pre-packaged muffins (Otis Spunkmeyer, banana nut and chocolate, okay stuff for this type of place),
the dining area is sunny and pleasant. When I was there mid-week, not many people there, so difficult to know how quiet or noisy might be over a weekend. Located in a new business park area with a hospital nearby, feels safe and is away from the Strip. A computer down in the lobby area was not working, so wasn't sure if they were upgrading to provide it or it had gone off.- the had a sign tacked to it. But if/when it works, will be another convenient area of the hotel to check a quick email if you dont have your computer with you. Rooms have free wifi (didn't use it so can't say whether it was fast, slow, etc.) A/C was fairly quiet and put out a ton of cold air on a very very hot day (106). Beds fairly comfy. Complimentary newspaper for guests. Overall if you are looking for a pet friendly hotel that is also in a quiet, safe and clean area of L.Vegas,
this may be a good choice. The pet room was clean, a few spots on the rug but nothing that you might not find anywhere else. Again, the hotel wasn't very busy that night, so not sure how noisy the first floor might be with barking, etc. but most pet owners these days are fairly responsible if they are traveling with their pet, so hopefully it would not be a problem. No major pluses or minuses on this hotel, and depending on what you want, it could that suits your needs.</p><br>Overall O.K.<p>`Nice Staff, BUT it's a one-man show. The Front Desk was really helpful and friendly, but couldn't accomodate needs from our rooms due to lack of help (personnel), to carry out duties. Maids/Housekeeping very efficient, but few of them. Our room was next to the fitness room. A little small and dated. It would be nice if the bathrooms had locking doors instead of the closet-style doors. Couldn't get the internet to work in our room, but was available in the lobby/breakfast area. blankets were thin and some had holes in them, but all linens and sleep sets were clean. Two Full (not Queen) size beds were small for four people, but overall comfortable. Extra blankets weren't available (they were ALWAYS OUT!). In fairness to the hotel, a lot of Lacrosse Players there for a tournamnet, but, whether lacrosse or anything else, hotels should be able to adjust to the pressure brought onto them. Nice continental breakfast. Endless coffee. Nice pool/hot tub area. I think if there were more staff and supplies, this would be a GREAT PLACE, and you can't complain about the price. An O.K. stay in Summerlin! Suggest also, Marriott Courtyard on Rainbow.</p><br>The worst night's sleep we ever had<p>We booked this hotel online and specified that the room be non-smoking as my boyfriend suffers from asthma. We arrived and we told the only room they had for us was a smoking one. After much discussion with the hotel employee, and after spending an hour on the phone trying to get another hotel (it was the day before Valentine's Day) and finding nothing we had no choice but to stay there for the night. You might think a smoking room would not smell that bad, well it was like there were 50 people in there smoking, the smell was beyond awful. And it got on everything, even the bed sheets, so we couldn't sleep much, I kept waking up with the smell. We left the next day with all our belongings stinking of smoke, which then made the car smell too. Never again. This was the worst hotel experience ever. And the staff were most unhelpful.</p><br>Nice hotel but too close to freeway noise<p>This was your typical La Quinta, and maybe even a little nicer than some. But the big draw back, and I think this might apply to any of their rooms, and certainly to ours, was the noisy freeway! We were at the back of the building, 5th floor (rm 523) and could look out the window and see the drivers of the cars - we were that close! Road noise doesn't usually bother me, but this was just waaay too close and it's a busy road. The hum and whine of the 18-wheeler truck tires, the motorcycles ... those noises especially were irritating and bothersome for a "restful" stay in the room. We liked everything else about the place, and it had a pretty low price (could this be the trade-off as to why?) but I am not sure we will be back to this one, or not. The noise didn't bother my husband, so some folks would be okay with that aspect of it. I will recommend it due to the fact that he was fine with it, and that everything else about the place was nice.</p><br></body></html>
