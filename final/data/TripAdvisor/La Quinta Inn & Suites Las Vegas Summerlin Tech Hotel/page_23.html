Room was roomy and bed very comfortable. Had room near freeway but found it was very quiet. Staff was pleasant. Breakfast offereings in the morning are sparse, plan on having breakfast someplace else.</p><br>Clean, great beds, friendly staff!<p>When you find something great, I believe in sharing with others. This hotel is where you want to stay if you like a clean, newer hotel, a safe beautiful area, great beds, extremely helpful friendly staff, a delicious free breakfast and air conditioning system that works great in a very hot place! I can't imagine anyone finding something bad here! We'll be back for sure, the front desk and all of their staff go above and beyond to please you!!!</p><br>Good Property for Traveling with Pets<p>We stayed in this hotel while we were in Las Vegas on business and traveling with our family dog. The staff was very "pet friendly", and gave us a room on the main floor close to the door giving our elderly family dog easy access to the grassy areas. The property is older, but was very clean and comfortable.</p><br>A clean, comfortable, convenient, and pleasant stay<p>My La Quinta Inn could not have been more convenient--off the freeway, a couple of right and left turns and you're there. The room was ready, clean, and quiet. Breakfast was excellent. The price was right. Thanks</p><br>Another excellent stay - hope to be back next year!<p>I stayed here for the first two nights and the final night of a 25 night US & Canada road trip spanning July & August. Having stayed here for seven nights last summer and being more than happy with my stay then, it was an obvious choice to return. Convenient location for getting into and out of Las Vegas, friendly & helpful staff, clean & comfortable room (maybe a fridge in each room would be nice, but it's a relatively minor point as there's an ice machine downstairs), well-stocked breakfast (nothing fancy, but that suits me)...

I can only continue to reitterate my previous review, except to add how helpful Clint (the night audit guy) was when my "very basic for my travels" netbook went into meltdown (a Windows update failed & messed the whole thing up!) on the second evening. He has a similar (albeit much better) netbook and really went out of his way to try to help fix mine. Turns out I don't have the inbuilt software to reset it back to the factory settings, so it was either pay the Geek Squad $130, or wait until I got back to Blighty to fix it for free & rely on hotel computers (I chose the latter).

So, if you want a quiet location, but the convenience of getting to the Strip in 20-25 minutes and easy road access to surrounding attractions (Death Valley, Red Rocks, etc) I'd definitely recommend this place... ;-))</p><br>Happy Camper!<p>I have been traveling a lot this summer and staying in pet friendly hotels. La Quinta has been the best. It as large rooms, a comfy stuffed chair and footstool by one of two windows, a large dressing room, a pool that is heated and large enough for lap swimming, breakfast, and an excellent staff. The neighborhood is beautiful and close to a large shopping center with restaurants and theaters. My only complaints are the bed is a tad too soft and a few large stains on the carpet from previous guests. :-) l would stay here again.</p><br>Awesome stay<p>Our family has stayed at various La Quinta Hotels over the last several years often due to emergency situations.
Always we have found the hotels clean, friendly and affordable. The La Quinta at Summerlin is the best stay we have had to date. From the General Manager to front desk to housekeeping their response was always,'yes, and what can we do to help.
We generally stay at a time share resort since we are owners, but, when we need a hotel stay La Quinta, in particular this one, will always be our next choice. KUDOS ...and our two dogs too!</p><br>Great quality for the money.<p>Wonderful place to stay as a pass thru Vegas. Away from all the noise and hustle if heading north or south. No Casinos close by but a very clean, quiet and staff friendly hotel. Will definety stay there the next time I am heading north or south on my travels.</p><br>Quiet and comfy<p>This location is a bit out of the way if you've never been there before, but also makes for a quiet night. Very clean room, comfy beds, good breakfast, helpful front desk staff made for a good stay. Hallway carpets are pretty grungy, but everything in our room was very clean. Got a better price here than the Summerlin Red Rocks location.</p><br>Good Value for Location<p>We stayed here as a stop on a trip to Lake Tahoe. The staff was friendly and the room was clean. The breakfast was simple, but added to the value. Would we stay here again? Yes, as a stopover on a trip to Tahoe again.</p><br></body></html>
