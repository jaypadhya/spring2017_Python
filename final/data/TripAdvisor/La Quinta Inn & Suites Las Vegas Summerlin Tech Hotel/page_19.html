<html><head><h3>La Quinta Inn & Suites Las Vegas Summerlin Tech Hotel Reviews Page 19</h3></head><body><br>Quality<p>When we stayed at La Quinta Inn & Suites in Las Vegas , its was great everyone was friendly & helpful . Some hotels don't answer your questions but they did . We highly recommend a stay at this spot .</p><br>Enjoyed our stay<p>The room was clean. The bed was comfortable. The A/C fan stayed on continuously so we slept well. The breakfast was acceptable. Cold cereal, toast, waffles, hard boiled eggs, apples, oranges, yogurt, coffee, juice, milk. It's a pet friendly hotel so we heard some dogs barking but it didn't last long. We would stay here again.</p><br>Airline's choice<p>Stuck here for one night awaiting my flight. Check in was easy ..room was ok did have wifii ..
But the walls are paper thin we had drunk people screaming , banging on doors..some lady on her cell yelling about how she lost her purse money passport at 4am. And promptly at 6am the room 3 doors down there dogs decided to bark. 2 hours sleep & we bolted !!</p><br>Pets welcome<p>We were so thankful to find a nice, clean and quiet hotel that allowed us to bring our dog family members. We were moving from Utah to California and it was such a relief to have a clean room, shower and comfortable bed. Our large dog Neeka agrees whole heartedly!
Right from the first moment I called to reserve both rooms the staff was very helpful in explaining all our options. Room in the parking lot for a 22' moving truck which was so helpful.
Thank you La Quinta Inn & Sites Las Vegas Summerlin Tech for making our not so pleasant move a lot easier.</p><br>Awesome Hotel with GREAT STAFF<p>checked in, staff was very helpful, and very polite. The room was extremely nice, bed was very comfortable, nice bathroom. Our kids enjoyed the nice pool, wonderful breakfast and easy to get to the hotel. We enjoyed our stay .
Room Tip: I don't think you will have any problems with whatever room you get.

I fell asleep watching television.When I woke up(12 :30 AM) I turn down the bed to find blood on the sheets. I called the front desk, only no one would answer the phone. So I went down to the front desk to talk to someone. He was there, but on the phone talking to someone about a book he had read. The phone in the background was ringing, but his lack of attention to the ringing phone was the same towards me standing there. He never even acknowledged I was even there. After about two minutes, I gave up, went back to my room, packed my bags and checked out, never to return.
The service I received prior to my stay was excellent, unfortunately this was a case of bate and switched, to no service</p><br>great stay<p>Nice clean room, very comfortable bed and pillows. Spacious room and large desk. Great water pressure. Very nice stay. Will stay again. Breakfast was included. Attentive front desk.coffee in room, microwave and fridge in room at no extra cost which I did use.</p><br>Great stay &amp;  walking distance to soccer fields<p>This is a great hotel with free breakfast , nice pool and hottub area and handled many sport teams and a busy weekend with ease. The price was also the best price I have received on a hotel in the area. This is a dog friendly hotel and although I felt there were a bit too many dogs on this particular stay the hotel seemed to keep them on a single floor.</p><br>Housekeeping Phoned It In<p>First, they put me in an ADA smoking room and the reservation choices at the LQ website never gave me those choices. Tried to change rooms but the manager said they were sold out. It was disgusting, it smelled like they had a cigar convention in the room for 15 years. My eyes teared. I would have switched hotels but was exhausted.

To make matters worse, there was a huge toenail in the middle of the floor, the floor lamp was not plugged in there was a used towel hanging on the hook behind the bathroom door, the bathtub faucet was running and the coffee maker was not cleaned.

I have stayed at LQ's up and down the west coast and this was by far the worst of it.</p><br>AVERAGE<p>Very good hotel, but you need two people at the front desk at the reception area.
When the attendant is writing his report people have to wait 20 minutes or longer to be registered, for tahis reason there it is the need for a second person.</p><br></body></html>
