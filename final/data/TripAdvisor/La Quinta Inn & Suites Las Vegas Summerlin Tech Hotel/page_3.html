<html><head><h3>La Quinta Inn & Suites Las Vegas Summerlin Tech Hotel Reviews Page 3</h3></head><body><br>First timer at La Quinta properties<p>Was not planning on staying here but change of plans brought me here. My check in was greeted by a very friendly staff she gave me all the information I needed. The room was clean the bed was very comfortable and not far from freeway access.</p><br>Great Experience!<p>I stayed here while in Vegas on a house-hunting mission. We were preparing to move to the area, and I just needed a place to call home base for 4 or so days. I can't think of anything that went wrong. I had a first floor room which was surprisingly quiet, and I liked it because it was close to the parking lot. The free breakfast is modest but enough. They could have larger coffee cups, but I really like my coffee. In the grand scheme of things, not a big deal. The pool area was clean and quiet. The three times I visited, only one other family was there for a portion of the time I was.

My husband then stayed here again a month later with our cat. He had no issues, and again it was a positive experience.</p><br>Summerlin Surprise!<p>I had stayed at La Quinta nearby Nellis a year ago and raved about it to my husband. So, when we decided to make this trip I decided to check out another location to see if there is consistency. THERE IS! We checked in at 3p WITH NO ISSUES. I left a message on my reservation we needed bottom floor nearby a door for our dogs. We got a room on the bottom floor exactly halfway between the side and back doors. Our room was totally wonderful! Cool when we checked in from a scorching outside. Well appointed with the amenities you'd need. Comfortable bed/bedding. The greens were all cleaned up so the dog owners are doing their part. My husband said there were bags and a disposal container right at the grassy area he used for our dogs. They do not seem to have issues with the size of dogs. Ours are small in comparison but not the smallest. But I saw rather large dogs. Our room did not have any evidence there was any pet ever inside except right at the bottom corner of the door and door frame where it looked like a dog had pawed. But, it was simply the best! Thank you all! There is one thing I had to tell the check clerk, the morning we were leaving the conference room was in use and they were burning incense. My husband came back to the room in full asthma attach and when he opened the door the smoke in the hallway had made it all the way down to our room. She was unaware it was the conference or that there was incense burnimng because up there when I checked out you could not smell it. She immediately reported it to her manager. The customer service was awesome at check in and check out!
Room Tip: If you have pets the bottom level is fairly large and there are multiple exits to grass.
See more room tips</p><br>good and bad<p>Inside the hotel was great...Staff was great...outside was covered with dog feces...it appeared that dog owners do not pick up after their pets and neither does the staff....the hotel provides bags and a place to dispose of the feses but appears was not used...</p><br>Terrible<p>Where do I start, first when we got there my first impression was OK place from outside. OK halfway ands breakfast area. Rooms were supposed to be non-smoking but all the rooms I was in smell so badly of cigarettes and piss. Carpet looked as if it has never seen shampoo. If you walk with it shoes you're bond to come home with something. My son unfortunately did home down with a car of hand, foot and mouth disease. I'll post pics when I'm done h here. Terrible nasty maintenance service guy Patrick. His attitude just absolutely sucks. If you don't like your job, 3 things you could do: 1- smile and pretended you like it and stop making people uncomfortable with your nasty looks. 2- lose weight so you can move faster and be happier. 3- just quit and work somewhere else. It's a business not a prison so stop sour pusing everyone's day with your stupid faces of "I hate the world" looks. Smile even if it hurts. However, in all this place needs a new manager that cares about everything not just putting money in their boss's pocket. Now the front desk service was terrible when it came to the He-she with the attitude problem. Just awful! Be happy you have a job treat people with respect and you'll get it back. Jordan was the only one that was professional A++ for her. The others just an embarrassment. Don't stay here is expensive and disgusting place to lay on. These fake reviews will drive you to make the terrible decision I made and stayed in this horrible place.</p><br>Lake Tahoe<p>It was well located for our purposes, being on the north side of Las Vegas. The property was well maintained. The room was very comfortable and clean. I don't believe in using more words than necessary and if you require more than I am willing to write, then forget it.</p><br>Nice get away<p>Hotel is clean and staff is very nice. Breakfast was enjoyable with a large cheerful dining area. We have stayed here a number of times. It is within a reasonable distance to downtown Las Vegas and Fremont area, without the unreasonable prices. There are restaurants nearby as well.</p><br>some place to sleep.<p>bad location, expensive for being so far from the strip, carpets need cleaning in the hall ways, too many dogs allowed. breakfast was nothing to write home about. forced to do this write up just to complete this stupid survey. waste of time, because of their being stupid about this survey, I wont stay at La Quinta again.</p><br>Enjoyable expereance<p>The Stay was very enjoyable. Te rooms was very nice and the bed was excellent. Food was good. We enjoyed our stay.The area the hotel is in was very good . Felt very safe. and the pet area was nice and clean.</p><br>Pet-Friendly Hotel in Great Area<p>I love La Quinta Inns because they're always so pet-friendly. This one is in Summerlin, which is a great area off the strip, and perfect if you're going to Red Rock park, or the Red Rock Casino. I had a room on the ground floor near an exit, but there's not a lot of grass around the place for the dog. It is the desert.</p><br></body></html>
