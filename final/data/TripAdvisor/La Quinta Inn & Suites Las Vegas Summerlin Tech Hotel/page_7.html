<html><head><h3>La Quinta Inn & Suites Las Vegas Summerlin Tech Hotel Reviews Page 7</h3></head><body><br>Good value<p>We stayed for 2 days. The room was spacious and very comfortable and included a mini fridge and microwave, free wifi. The area is a medical zone but is about a mile away from many shops and restaurants, just off the freeway. Parking is free and right outside your door. Very convenient. We were glad to be away from the crowds and traffic and the price was the lowest around, good value!</p><br>Excellent Stay<p>My wife and I enjoyed our stay at Quinta Inn in vegas, clean rooms, free continental breakfast, free internet, and away from casinos, comfortable beds and excellent customer service and excellent price. certainly enjoyed our stay and would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Las Vegas</p><br>Excellent Experience at La Quinta Las Vegas - Sumerlin Tech Center<p>Had an excellent experience at Las Quinta Las Vegas - Sumerlin Tech Center. Especially loved that they were a dog friendly hotel, our dogs loved it too. They had nice grass areas with doggie bags for them to do their business and they also had a nice path in the back were I could walk them. Would highly recomend to anyone needing a dog friendly hotel to stay in Las Vegas.</p><br>My stay was pleasant<p>I was sick during my stay and was in my room most of the time. I had to go out to get food which was a hassle because it was very cold outside. However, the people were courteous and helpful when I asked. The toilet had a problem and the repair came up immediately and fixed it. I was a little disappointed with the coffee but started getting coffee out.</p><br>Great area, Great facility, Pet Friendly<p>Incredibly Pet Friendly facility. Rooms are comfortable. Centrally located to Medical Facilities, Shopping, Restaurants, Banking, and more. Staff is friendly and helpful. For business or non-gambling pleasure, it is a great value for the money.</p><br>Safe place with a great atmosphere and breakfast<p>I was going to Vegas on personal business on my own. I looked at hotels that were quite a bit cheaper and they just didnt seem safe. I knew this hotel. I knew how to get there and it was close to Summerlin area where my business was taking place the following morning. That all being said...it was a no brainer this is one of the best hotels in it's area.</p><br>my stay<p>service was good very friendly and nice breakfast was ok need more time your hours of breakfast need to be extended my room had hair in my bed it was nasty ,,, i will probably not stay in that hotel again and it is a long way out from vegas</p><br>Very Serviceable Hotel<p>It's certainly not a Strip resort, but if you're looking to stay in Summerlin at a decent rate this property fits the bill. Clean but not to dated, with a very friendly and helpful staff. It's located about 15 minutes from the Strip and Downtown, right off the freeway.</p><br>Good Value<p>Nice,clean, friendly staff. Very accommodating, they moved me to a 1st floor room for convenience when they found out I was traveling with 2 dogs. I have stayed here twice and will now use it for my frequent trips through Nevada. Nice to have breakfast also.</p><br>Disappointing<p>Staff was courteous but not especially friendly (except for substitute handling breakfast.) Surprised to see beds are full rather than queen. Room is really too small to accommodate queen. the room was clean and adequately decorated. Tubs are old. Breakfast was especially disappointing from my experience at La Quinta.
Room Tip: Rooms were quiet even though hotel had a large # of teens staying for soccer tournament.
