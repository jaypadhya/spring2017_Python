<html><head><h3>La Quinta Inn & Suites Las Vegas Summerlin Tech Hotel Reviews Page 16</h3></head><body><br>Soccer fields<p>Came to Las Vegas for a soccer tournament; the soccer fields are right around the corner. Nice breakfast in the morning. Very friendly staff. The beds were a little uncomfortable. The bathroom was not very clean.</p><br>ANOTHER LQ WINNER<p>Just another LQ that doesn't disappoint.Wonderful staff(especially Lucy at the front desk),the traditional comfy bed with lots of pillows.Nice size room and very clean.If there was one thing I'd say needed improvement it would be their breakfast.It's lagging behind other LQ's as far as variety of breakfast items.The facility is still great value for the money.Wouldn't think twice about staying there again and certainly wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone.</p><br>Would stay again if spray for bugs!<p>The beds are horrible for 2 people. And there were bugs. Rooms are huge so that was a plus. Value was great. Breakfast was poor. Location was great considering the softball fields were within walking distance. Just wish the beds were bigger. Otherwise it was a great place for softball teams to stay.</p><br>Excellent Customer Service<p>Great stay...the lady @ the front desk has a genuine concern to make the customer extremely happy. Total staff was very accommodating & friendly. Rooms very clean. It was just as I remembered when we had an extended stay @ this la Quinta 11 years ago....including the lady @ the front desk!</p><br>Perfect and Convenient<p>I have stayed here twice. This place is by far one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in. I have stayed in much more expensive rooms that don't have half of what these people have.

First, they allow dogs. Yes, even my labrador retriever, without any hassles. No deposits, bad looks and the rooms are really clean.

Rooms have a refrigerator, microwave, large TV, a desk with many plugins (very rare), great AC, hair dryer, ironing board, iron, coffee maker, alarm clock closet, huge king bed and a AAA discount.

The staff was so friendly on checkin and on checkout, asking about my drive.

Good selection for breakfast and tasty.

A desk in the lobby with a computer and printer if needed.

Will stay here every time I visit Las Vegas</p><br>Safe4 Place when a Loved One Is In Scottsdale-Shea<p>I stayed at La Quinta 4 blocks from the hospital, while my husband was in a medical induced comma. I had my dogs to keep me centered, clean room, laundry facilities, refrigerator, microwave to make me feel at home. I was safe and secure and felt welcome.</p><br>Best housekeeping, front desk and breakfast room.....<p>We stayed 6 nights here while day hiking in Valley of Fire and Red Rock parks. Location was brilliant for getting out of town each day, great for access to Costco, REI, Total Wines etc...It is in an area of medical labs and tech business's so not any restaurants for a mile or so but easy 5 minute drive. The rooms are spacious and very clean. The front desk staff (three different gentlemen) were always helpful and the two women that hosted the huge and well set up breakfast (free) area were always pleasant and had things running well. The place is starting to show it's age and needs a little attention from head office. We had a room on the 5th floor, it had a huge window which gave the room generous natural light. Down side was that the window which was only 24" from the floor opened wide and had only a flimsy mosquito screen to prevent the possibility of a young child falling through...Most jurisdictions have regulations which limit the window opening to about 8" We were surprised to find this in such a large chain.

The elevators are badly stained and graffiti is scratched on the stainless steel....Doesn't fit with the rest of the building. We used the pool and if had hair clips, paper and dirt on the bottom and obviously had not been cleaned in awhile despite being heated and used.

All in all, the staff and large bright rooms made this a great stay and we will book again next time in Las Vegas/Summerlin
Room Tip: Get a room away from the freeway, #95 is only 100 feet away. Top floors have great views.

We had our first date night here and we just celebrated our first year anniversary here. This is a very special place for the both of us. The service is excellent!!!</p><br>Excellent Choice<p>For the money, LaQuinta is worth it. The room was super clean and comfy. The breakfast was adequate which saves money. The location was in an area that was quiet, however restaurants and shopping was just a few streets away.. Spend the extra $20.00 and experience a restful evening.</p><br>Fur children welcome<p>Not only is this hotel away from the hubbub of the strip, it is close to Red Rock for dog walking and freeway accessible for trips to Mt. Charleston for those that prefer nature to gambling, but that's. available too if you want to mix it up. We were so impressed with the fact that this hotel offers some open space to actually walk dogs for those late night necessities. The hotel is clean and offers a comfortable room with a good size bathroom, big desk and chair for those that want to work, microwave and fridge to keep your own food. There is also a nice gym facility and nice breakfast is laid out every morning. For $79.00 we just couldn't have asked for a better accommodation that welcomed our fur children with no hassle. If you want to take your dogs on vacation with you. This place is the bomb!</p><br></body></html>
