It's still my favourite steakhouse in Las Vegas, maybe because I'm sentimental, but I've never, never been disappointed here. Old style Vegas Steakhouse, dark, fantastic view of the city and lights and lots of airplane traffic (well, the airplane lights in the dark sky) Just a really cool place. Highly recommended. $$$</p><br>Drinks<p>We stopped for drinks whilst we were in Fremont street, bar tender was really polite and very helpful. The only drinks they really serve is liquor and beer, if you wanted a cocktail or something different you were out of luck. We managed to get a table at the doorway of the casino and watched the street performers.</p><br>Binion's Million Dollar Cash Photo!<p>Everytime we go to Vegas we always make a trip to Binion's. A tradition to take a photo with the One Million Cash. Also in the back is a great place to do shopping for shirts, fleec jackets, caps,tote bags, children items & other clothing on the racks. I always do my shopping there. The prices are very reasonable. Binion's is always noisey and people playing everywhere. Downtown is like the olden days. Nothing fancy, just fun & shopping.</p><br>Winner winner chicken dinner!<p>We have went there last December and now this time around, we always enjoy gambling there because we win! We have eaten at their multiple restaurants all good btw. As long as your playing you drink for free, just tip your great waitress! Take a picture with a million dollars! Yes real dollars. Must visit if you're on Fremont. Good luck!</p><br>Oldie but Goodie<p>Fremont Street is a must see especially at night, the bands are playing and all the fun begins, two zip lines for the adventurous,deep fried Twinkie and deep fried oreo's are a must, 9.99 prime rib with salad bar and desert, watch the laser show on the roof of Fremont Street,Glitter Gulch 2 beer minimum, or just walk up and down the street and watch the show, be sure to bring your camera.</p><br>Steakhouse at Binion's<p>Bionion's has a steakhouse on the top floor. Great Prime Rib served with a view. This is old school Las Vegas. Decor is done in reds and is darkened with shaded candles on tables. Romantic spot for a celebration dinner, as the room has windows around perimeter looking out on the lights of Vegas. Full bar and wine list. Attentive wait staff. Don't miss the Srawberries Romanoff for dessert. Portion was more than enough for two to share.</p><br>Unbelievable!<p>I stopped here to gamble on my visit to Vegas, free beer while on slots is a must. A lot of casinos offer it but never come around to serve. Binions is on it, beer after beer. Love the old style feeling!</p><br>Binion's Horshoe Casino is the King of Old Las Vegas!!!<p>When you go there they have a display with One Million dollar and, they will give a FREE picture of it with you. The hotel is in front of The Freemont Experience and that is very colorful. It is OK to look but do not touch anything.</p><br>OLD VEGAS<p>The Hungry Detective returned to Binion's Horseshoe Hotel & Casino Las Vegas
25 years later and totally relived the great days of the 1980's. If you love nostaligia and old school Las Vegas look no further. I used to play $1 Blackjack and enjoy the $5 Steak dinner. Those days are gone but Binion's still rocks then house with vintage photographs and history of Old Las Vegas. The million dollars in cash is stacked a little different but its there...If you like to gamble this is cool as they come!!!

VERDICT: Binion's is guilty of delivering the goods to Old Las Vegas!!!
Room Tip: Order the Hangover Burger Special when you need to refuel your jets!!!
