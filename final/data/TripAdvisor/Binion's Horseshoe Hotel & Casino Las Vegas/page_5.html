Me and a friend where playing 3 card pork and where both winning when the pit boss came over and said my friend owed them money as a winning bet should not have been paid out (CCTV apparently) anyway the game got held up for 20 minutes, after that the pit boss said my friend had to give money back ($70) with much muttering under his breath the pit boss
lost all respect of the table and we decided to leave, at there cost as we probably would have sat there until we give them are winnings back, as you do.</p><br>Great service and what a view!<p>We stumbled upon the steak house hungry and boy are we glad we did. The view alone was amazing, the service was excellent and the steak was delicious! We ordered the oysters Rockefeller which were to die for. If you are on Fremont and looking for fine dinning at a reasonable price head here</p><br>Great snack bar<p>I often dine at Binion's snack bar and sit at the counter. Steve and Clancy and the others who work the counter are great. A large burger and potato salad is $4.95. The bean soup of the day with cornbread is another favorite. Great place and value.</p><br>Good Casino with Some Freebies<p>We visited Binion's while on a recent trip to Vegas. It is located downtown on Fremont Street. They have a small Elvis Museum that is free of charge and has a nice collection of personal memorabilia and his last car that he owned before his death. It is open daily 1pm-3pm. Also, be sure and stop by and have your picture made with the million dollars. It is also free, takes about 30 minutes to develop and is a nice keepsake picture. Binion's offers a hotdog, chips and a beer for $4.95, but this is only available after 5pm. Nice small casino that is reminiscent of old Vegas and worth checking out if doing the Fremont Street Experience.</p><br>Old town Vegas<p>Binions is old town Vegas, best hamburgers in Vegas. Still has the old Vegas flare, we just love going in there. Everyone is frendly.Keep up the great job your doing. We enjoy down toen Vegas, We have been staying down town for years.</p><br>The Casino was warm and inviting<p>I stopped off in Binions with my wife and her parents and found it to be a cozy nook of a casino. I bought in on a BJ game with $100 and left with $395. But what impressed me most were the female dealers who were very sexy and showed lots of cleavage. They seemed so happy and made conversation with the players that warmed your heart. Drinks were free, of course, and I always tipped my server nicely. There was a good vibe about the place. I'm 54 years old and the dealer's made me feel young and attractive again. I loved it.</p><br>More of the same<p>Usually play here every trip to LV and it is just another run-of-the-mill downtown casino. It does have a long and rich history as Benny Binion was quite the gaming pioneer. This is where the original WSOP started. It has since been purchased by Caesar's Gaming but not much has changed. They do have lower stakes tables than on the strip, but their slots don't seem any looser than a 300 lb. woman's girdle. The million dollar display is unique and a must-see for any vacationer. Outside of that....? Never stayed in rooms so I can't comment. Understand they are a good value though, price-wise.</p><br>Binions<p>Binions is a great place to play cards early in the morning. We know a lot of the dealers and pit executives also they really make things enjoyable.The cafe is also a great place to eat in the morning. Real great if Angela is your waitress.
Room Tip: You need to stay on south tower.

If I'd known how your casino staff was I would have stayed at your casino. What awesome staff you have. Everyone was so polite and very friendly from getting a players card to eating at the cafe. We had a lot of fun at your casino. Please credit your staff for being so polite! See ya soon! The Hargrove family!</p><br>Good food<p>They have good food deals every condiment you want for BEEF hotdogs and some tasty pizza for $4. I will return here every year!! This is a review for Binion's Bullpen which I just found out is a cigar bar. No one was smoking at 1pm when we went. Binion's has other good food deal in this casino/hotel we didn't play or stay but the deals for food is what drew us in!</p><br></body></html>
