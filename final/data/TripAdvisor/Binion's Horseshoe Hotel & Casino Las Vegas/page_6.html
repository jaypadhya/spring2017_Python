<html><head><h3>Binion's Horseshoe Hotel & Casino Las Vegas Reviews Page 6</h3></head><body><br>The casino and cafe ok.<p>The casino was ok. It is on Fremont Street and is older. They did have a place where you could take a picture in front of 1 million dollars. The picture was free and a nice token to take home. The service in the cafe was not the greatest. The server took the order -dropped the food and that was it. We had to ask other people for things we needed. You got a break on the price if you had a rewards card with the casino but I didnt think it was worth it.</p><br>Slower pace, good food<p>So I stayed on the main strip for a week and finally made it to the "Old Strip." We went into Binion's and I can imagine my folks gambling and having a great time here. It has a mix of old and new casino games, but the atmosphere is slow paced. It was a nice change. Now let me mention that we went in the afternoon. We ate at the little diner they have and it was great. It was only a couple dollars for really good food. I did not expect to pay for parking, but we had to.</p><br>Binion's Bullpen!<p>I keep returning to the Binion Bullpen Cigar Lounge for the great service, low cost drafts, and satisfying pub food. This was Binion's original bar (I remember the day...) and it's all here except it is enclosed and you can have some great smokes (see Vato's Cigars across the way). Great menu with to-die-for burgers and appetizers. They do not allow children because of the cigar smoke so just know that for the betterment of the little ones. Catch the game here as well. Did I say great service?</p><br>This is hard to miss location known for good food and gambling<p>Well marked corner location. Lots of old Las Vegas action here. Casino.hotel older and one must really love that kind of atmosphere
Fremont free street show just outside the door one must at least visit this casino once while in Las Vegas.</p><br>Best Burgers on Freemont<p>Have to come to The Horseshoe. They are in the Heart of Downtown & have been there for years. Classic Casino who serves the BEST Burgers. Binions burgers that is on Freemont ! Great place to gamble. And the people there are always so nice & friendly.</p><br>Black Jack<p>This was our first time visiting Las Vegas. We stayed on the strip but visited Freemont Street twice during our 3 day visit. We had a great time playing Black Jack at Kiki's table! She was really nice and helpful. Kiki made our first time at Binions a very memorable experience!</p><br>Binnions<p>Love the old casino atmosphere.Great drink service.Great food at the cafe.My favorite casino in Las Vegas.Check out the million dollar display and get your picture taken with it.Cigar bar in the back.</p><br>My Favorite Place to Gamble!<p>We always stay on the strip, but love gambling at Binions. I love their hospitality...feels like TEXAS...friendly...hospitality!!! You can actually go there and find $5.00 blackjack tables on a Friday/Saturday night, unlike the strip, where they raise the minimums to $25.00 per hand. Binions is my all time favorite place to gamble in Vegas!!
Room Tip: I did not stay at the hotel,just went to gamble.
