<html><head><h3>Binion's Horseshoe Hotel & Casino Las Vegas Reviews Page 16</h3></head><body><br>first stay downtown<p>we stayed here labour day weekend , after a long flight , long lines at passport and security and luggage still in chicago , when we finaly found reception ( cab drop us on wrong side of building ) we were given ( cant remember number ) a room on the third floor , now i know we werent in the best of moods , and this is a 1star hotel but , if i had a dog ,i wouldnt let it stay in that room . good grief it looked like a flop house !!! went back to reception ask for a change of room . this was no problem , the room on the 17th floor was better , just about lived up to its one lonely star but not great , but hay the rooms only for sleeping , it was labour day weekend and we did expect it to be loud , but you could hear every word spoken and shouted four rooms away , i didnt expect class here but theres better manners in the black hole .

the casino was ok but no more , and in daylight hours a pleasent change from the very over crowded strip , evenings were busy but not as manic as the strip .

we had concerns about safety down town , it was fine didnt feel or see anything any worse than you see or feel in any city .

had a meal at the hotels skeak house which was good and fair priced , the place was half empty ( labour day weekend ) .

one word of warning if you buy a beer in the casino/hotel ,bud chnages in price from bar to bar , night to night , bar tender to bar tander ?????????? .

if we stayed down town again we wouldnt stay here .</p><br>Never Again!!!<p>I recently stayed at this hotel the night of Sept. 2, I have stayed previously in Vegas, but only on the strip. My wife and I had been wanting to stay on Fremont Street for the "Fremont Experience" I've always loved to play poker so we thought Binions would be awesome to stay at. Unfortunately, the experience was horrible. Upon arriving, I was not informed on how to get to my room. After using the wrong elevator (that doesn't go to the East tower) going down many wrong hallways, and asking a housekeeper, I reached my room 20 minutes later. As I entered the room (I believe room 330), I was extremely unsatisfied to find the condition of the room. The paint was peeling from the toilet seat, the shower had a huge hole and was tied together on the top left corner, the ceilings had spots of brown from previous leaks, iron burn marks on the floor, make up stain on the bed covering, the list goes on. As I began to use the restroom I then realized I had no soap, or any of the other amenities. I called for housekeeping she arrived with the things, then preceded to enter my room to check behind the mirror as if I had lied about it. Overall the stay was the worse experience I have had compared to previous hotels. The room and treatment was not worth the $71 I paid. As you know, there are better deals for rooms in Vegas, but I was looking forward to staying in this establishment.</p><br>Nascar Dream<p>I stayed here first time in 2003 and was ready to return in 2004 for the next nascar race but was diasappointed to find that Harrahs had bought & closed the place. And may I note never called me to tell me that they had closed or my reservation had been cancelled (lucky I watch the news). From what i read no renovations were done to the hotel during this closure and the casino which I have recenlty visited and certainly has had no updates. Anyhow my visit I must say was a very positive one with an exception. Upon checking in with a few friends we pulled in the front entrance and Valet the car, a nice $5 bill was presented to the valet attendant and we asked if he could keep it close. Now for the rest of our 4 day stay this guy remembered that tip and took care of us every time as we did him, The car was keeped right next to the valet booth like we were vips or something. On the strip your $5 would never get u that far. We checked in and the nicest guy at the front desk helped us and got us a room facing the freemont street experience allthough we were above it we got the two beds and was it a nice room not really and there was a piece of carpet cut out of the floor and replaced very obvious and a bit scary but my friends and I joked about what we imagined happended in that room. The windows did open and I liked that fresh air. Rooms were not dirty they were suitable for me to stay for 4 days but they were not great either u get what u pay for and nascar weekend is steep on room rates. Here was the problem. One night early evening I peeked out our peep hole (we were at the end of a hallway) to find a Drunk Homeless looking person passed out on the floor. I stayed in my room as he seemed harmless not causing any trouble. I called security and he was removed within 5 minutes so I was impressed with the fast response to the problem and would say they do have sufficent security as i have read other peoples concerns about it. Also our first night we came in very late and were well a bit intoxicated and could not remember our room number. The man once again was most helpful in getting us the right number. We didn't eat at the Steakhouse, but we did go up there and had a drink and the free bread they gave us. WHen we read the menus and the smallest steak was like $36 and u had to pay for a potato seperate for another 8 bucks or so I thought it was a little outta my reach $ wise. But if you have the cash I recommend the steak house the view is INCREDIBLE. While staying downtown we dined at Tony Romas at Freemont, not bad for the $. Also Golden Gate has a little deli in the back with the most incredible french dips, and 99 cent shrimp coctail t die for I have it everytime and my tummy is never upset. Also another place in golden gate is the Bay City Diner my hubby loves the NY steaks there. If you are going to eat at a coffee shop I highly reccomend the Golden Nuggets that looks over the pool area They have great food 24/7 and u can even get it to go like I did at 4 am and brought it back to my room at binions. I love the $2 t-shirts next to the Glitter Gultch. Glitter Gultch went there and it is the girls who are rejected at all the other nice vegas strip clubs that end up here. 2 drink minimum to get in and a beer is like $9 but you can drink your beers toss a couple of $1 bills at the dancer at he stage and split, Do not waste your $on a lap dance. Free Beads at Mermaids and The La Bayou are always fun. And if your up for it the Neonopolis is located a block down from Fitzgeralds and has a great Movie Theater if your fed up with light shows and gambling. All in all Binions is a great place to stay my husband this last July 2006 one $95 in less that 5 minutes playing the field on craps there and he started with 5 bucks. We are gonna take a gamble and stay here in November if all goes well we will book again in March for the next Race.</p><br>Disappointed!<p>I always wanted to stay at the "Horseshoe" because of the history. My husband booked two months in advance and arrived late in the evening and given a room in the "OLD" section of the hotel. The room was so small you could hardly turn around in it. NO closet, NO vanity in the bathroom. The view from window was a Brick wall. I'm really not that picky, but could not stay in that room another night. The next room they gave us was much better (normal size etc.). At least the view from this room was looking down on the top of the Fremont Experience. The food wasn't bad, but I wouldn't go out of my way to dine there. The Casino is dark and dingy, but already knew this from being in there before. Parking was confusing as to how to get to the front desk to check in ...very in convienent or at least for senior's. It seemed to have a lack of security.and dirty.To sum it all up, I won't be staying there any time soon. I'm certainly glad I got staying at the "Horseshoe" out of my system. So much for history. I've decided I like "modern"a whole lot better. P.S. We have been to Vegas many times and this was without a doubt the most disappointing stay!</p><br>Binion's was super<p>Read the reviews, hubby's coworkers even asked your staying there? Negative reviews undeserved. Room in older portion (332). Clean, bath imaculate, TV including HBO worked fine. Casino staff efficient and friendly. Cocktail servers prompt, gambling fun. Easy to get everywhere from there. Parking for rental car easily accessed. Pool on rooftop clean and views great. Would return in a heartbeat. Terrific value.</p><br>Horrible<p>We booked a non smoking room and when we arrived we were told they didnt have non smoking rooms at all. I really dont mind smoking at all but our room was disgusting smelling. Not a nice place but it was dirt cheap, you get what you pay for</p><br>Another fine stay<p>This is not a top shelf hotel by any means. The hotel rooms were beat, and the tub didn't drain very well, and I would never take my wife here -- but my wife has very refined tastes, she has led me to believe -- but I had a fantastic time here.

Were the sheets lovely to behold? No they were not. Was the floor delicious to taste? I would not recommend further investigation. All in all, would I stay there again? Absolutely.

One nice thing? The windows open all the way. Enjoy the sounds of downtown Las Vegas, and the lovely breeze, as you teeter somewhat nervously near a 20-story drop. Not recommended after a night of drinking in the casino.

Higher-up rooms have balconies, where you can sit and enjoy the view! If you can score one of these, you are a smoother talker than I was.

You might be wondering, hey, what is so great about this hotel, anyway? Location. The location is absolutely central to everything you love in downtown. You can just skip down to the 'Gate, or the LV Club. Still a bit of a hike to the El Co' but you'll make it there. If you want to visit the wonderful Three Georges restaurant, it's just behind the casino in the Lady-Luck vicinity. This location is POISED for Vegas fun.

Location isn't everything, though. So visit the steak house. We always have a great time there. Very nice guys running the place, and the food was just fine. Great view, dark lighting, slabs of beef, just upstairs from your lovely room. Now that just spells vacation for me, thank you very much.

So yes, the only other place I've stayed (downtown) was the Plaza, and Binion's is far far better than that establishment. Although, at the Plaza, you can enjoy a beer on a park bench, while observing the light show at the porte cochere, which is a rare pleasure I advise you to sample on your next visit.</p><br>Best bang for your buck..<p>We stayed here for a week in May and had no problems whatsoever. At 37.00 a night you cant beat the price. If I wanted to have a high priced room then I would go to the strip. But when were in Vegas who stays in their room. We just wanted a clean room to lay our heads down on. Loved the pool on the roof. Checked out the pool across the street and everyone and your mother was there and can be seen. I prefer to see the whole Vegas view from the 25th floor. Going back again this May cant wait!! So if youd rather spend your money on something else besides the room stay here.</p><br>I Know The Answer!!!<p>After reading all the good and bad reviews of this hotel I finally stayed there myself and figured out why some love it and some hate it. I stayed there with a friend and we had two different rooms in two different parts of the hotel. One of the rooms (hers) smelled like the bowels of satan and mine was not as bad (not great) but not bad. I got a room right off the elevators near the check in desk but she got one in the old tower. Wow what a difference in the rooms. Hers was a hell hole and mine was ok. Now I GET IT. If you get the newer rooms they are ok but if you get the old tower, you're in hell. Even the ceiling out in her hallway was falling down. Mystery solved. Do yourself a favor and if you must gamble in vegas, do it in the casino and not with your hotel. Stay way from the binions.</p><br>Don't do it<p>I do not plan to ever stay here again! We checkedin for one Night Feb.25 2005 First we tried for early check in between the hours of 11:30 and 2:30 we had gone to the desk 3 times and the front desk clerk kept telling us to come back in an hour come back in an hour by 2:45 we asked again for our NON-SMOKING king bed room and at that time they said we can not gaurentee a non- smoking room even though we request a non-smoking 2 months in advance. and still would not have any rooms til 3:30 and thats with a rush on it. we spoke to management and he was no help at all!! when we finally got to our room I thought Motel 6 was better than this we closed the sun out curtians and light came though the holes. But bed and bath were clean.</p><br></body></html>
