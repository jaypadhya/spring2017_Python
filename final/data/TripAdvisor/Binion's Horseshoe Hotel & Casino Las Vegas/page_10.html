<html><head><h3>Binion's Horseshoe Hotel & Casino Las Vegas Reviews Page 10</h3></head><body><br>Hot time on Freemont<p>We stayed 4 nights at Binions in July. Actually got the room for less than $20 per night so it was a great bargin. Nothing fancy but was cool, good water pressure and had HBO on TV. The rooftop pool was nice. Did not eat any meals in Binions so cannot comment. Did not have any luck at their machines but did next door in the Freemont. I like staying downtown and enjoyed this stay very much.</p><br>Has more than it's share of problems<p>First let's start with the positives. The staff was great and friendly. The casino is very nice with an Old Vegas feel. The rooftop pool was great.

Now for the negatives. It looks like no money has been put into the rooms in over 25 years. The TV was an old Magnavox which was slow to turn on and only got 14 channels (one of which was the keno results from down in the casino). When we were the ice machine on our floor did not work for three of the four days we were there (even though we called on the first day and we met others who called as well). The bedding definitely needs to be replaced. The comforter has begun to get holes. The drapes also needed replaced, the backing had come off in spots and the light did shine through. The toilet only flushed liquids. For solids (like a #2 or toilet paper) we had to fill a trash can in the tub and then empty it into the bowl. The hotel wasn't very soundproof since we could hear the Fremont Experience from our room (which didn't bother us since we didn't go to bed before it ended around 12:30). Our next trip to Las Vegas definitely will be somewhere else.</p><br>best hotel and casino in las vegas<p>my wife and i have been going to the horseshoe (the original name) since 1970. we have always been treated like high rollers even we are far from it. rooms are nice. but the staff is exceptional and the ambiance is old las vegas. its great!!!!</p><br>Clean but Very Old<p>My husband and I stayed for two nights at Binions in April 2009. This hotel is very old. On one website there was a comment that said "Recently renovated in 1952". We thought this was hilarious. All of the furnishings are just that....50 years old. Although like mostly everyone says...it is kept clean. Check in was the quickest I have ever had in Vegas, about two minutes.
The first room we had had felt for carpeting with multiple old iron stains and a very old TV with no reception. We arrived very late so we immediatly went down to gamble and when we came back to sleep we immediatly noticed that the bed was seriously as hard as a rock. We slept there anyway for as long as we could....about six hours. All of the next day our backs and shoulders were killing us.
The next morning we went to the desk and asked for a different room because of the bed. The clerk was very helpful and just nodded as if she knew about the beds. She gave us keys to another room. The second room was the smallest hotel room I have ever seen. Maybe 8X8....not kidding. Although the bed was slightly softer it was a little bigger than a twin size bed for two people. So basically we had to sleep on top of each other.
Now on to the casino. This is one of our favorites in Las Vegas because the slots seem to always be loose and the tables hot with low limits. This hotel is dead center of all the action on Fremont street.
We did eat one morning at the coffee shop and the food was terrible and very overpriced.

So overall this is a very old hotel that is kept clean but has the worst beds possible. I would not recommend staying here longer than two nights because the uncomfortable sleeping will make you so tired that you wont enjoy your time in Vegas. But if you are looking for a room at rock bottom prices and can sleep on very hard beds then go for it. The location and the casino definetly do something to make up for the hotel rooms.</p><br>great casino with $2 roulette<p>Let me start by saying we are casual gamblers looking for fun without blowing a great deal of money. We live close to Altantic City and are long over being impressed with fancy , shiny , plastic casinos that suck your money from your wallet the minute you walk through the door. We stayed at the Golden Nugget but found their slots tight and table limits too high. Over to Binions we went where we discovered that on weekday afternoons, Binions has $2 rolette. What a blast. We played for hours on $20.00 and got fabulous drink service. We met great people from around the country and got local insight from the incredibely friendly dealers. In the evening , when the table limit changed to $5, the "boss" let us and the other couple playing continue with our $2 bets.
This is by far my favorite casino to gamble in. Great service and great fun! Cant wait to go back!!!!</p><br>Fine<p>Looks like I had just about exactly the same experience as all the other recent reviewers. Got a great price--came out to $9 a night after all the promotions. The room was dated but big and clean. Service was friendly.

My room faced Fremont street, so it was a little loud even on the 18th floor, not terrible but a little irritating sometimes. Also, I got a smoking room, which was not what I requested, as many others did. I checked in at midnight on a Friday, and the place seemed pretty full. so I probably got whatever was left.

And, exactly like everyone else's room, the cooling was a little iffy. It seemed to work fine at night, but one day I came back to the room and it was blowing warm air, it wouldn't cool off no matter what I did. I called maintenance, they said they'd send someone up, and it worked fine when I came back that night. So either the cooling system is on its last legs or they're saving pennies by turning it off during the day when they figure everyone is out anyway.

Oh, and it does have in-room coffee, which is a big plus for me. As hotel coffee goes, it was solidly above average.

So, not my favorite stay in Vegas, but acceptable. If prices were about equal, I'd probably pick somewhere else next time, but for $9 a night, I'd definitely stay there again.</p><br>Great value<p>We stayed 2 nites for $50.10. The room was clean and neat. Yes it needs refurbishing. The carpet was clean but had some staians and wear. The furniture was dated . The bathroom was old fashion but clean. The bed was comfortable.We would stay there again. Its a great location on Fremont. The front desk is slow, but the valet and bell desk are excellant. The gaming was better at 4 Queens. Better drink service. The bartender was rude and inatentive even though we were playing the poker machines in the bartop. Our room at The Flamingo on the strip was not much better. The coffee shop and snack bars are also really good and friendly service. Our room did not face Fremont St. so I can't comment on the noise some complain about from The Experience. Also don't miss the Steakhouse on top. The best there is, period.</p><br>Pleasantly Surprised !!!!!!!!<p>Some reviews of this hotel were very negative. I always like to form my own opioion. This property far exceeded my expectations. The room was a nice size and was very clean. We had a few minor problems,but they were handled promptly.The staff was amazing and everyone there is very customer oriented.If you want glitz and glamour,stay on the strip. . My husband had a bad cold while we were there and I needed to find a drug store to get him some cold medication.The front desk clerk offered to go get it for me when her shift ended. Imagine that !! It was within walking distance for me and I did it myself. I am from a very small town and was a bit apprehensive about wandering around by my self,but I felt safe doing it.
The casino was clean and the employees were helpful. They even take your picture with a million bucks and print the picture for you at no cost.
The coffee shop was great. If you go there,try the country fried steak. It was the best I've ever tasted. The snack bars were great. The tuna salad sandwich was excellent. The Binion burger was good. They even give you 2 for 1 coupons.
I would highly reccommend staying here. It is important to form your own opinion about these things.I absolutely loved this place. Thanks to Binion's, I had a wonderful trip to Las Vegas and we will be back..</p><br>Acceptable, convenient, cheap<p>As with the majority of downtown / Fremont hotels, this place has some great deals on hotel rooms. I've also stayed at Fitzgerald's and they're pretty much the same, save that Binion's has quicker elevators.
The room was a bit worn, but for a place to keep your stuff and sleep off the previous night, it's perfectly acceptable. Do not expect luxury or any extra amenities when staying here in a regular room at a discount rate.
Downtown is all about some of the last remaining old Vegas vibe, and convenience - there's no way you could visit 6 or 8 separate casinos and a few bars in one night on the strip, without taking many taxicab rides - - but downtown, it's all in walking distance. It's not glitzy, it's not luxury, no floor shows or roller-coasters, just gambling, drinking, people-watching, the Fremont light shows, and regular people generally having a great time.
If you want to stay downtown but step it up a star rating or two, check out the Golden Nugget, and their new pool area.
While the hotel itself was just the basics, I can say that the staff at Binion's were very gracious, helpful and friendly. The coffee shop downstairs is a bonus if you like breakfast any time of day.
They do offer free parking, but it's at one of the two hotel sides (and your room might be on the other side, so prepare for a bit of a walk). I thought I read that they had wi-fi, but couldn't get any sort of signal in my room.
I didn't check out the pool area, so I don't have an opinion on that.
I would recommend this hotel to someone who didn't want any extra frills.
If you're driving to this hotel (or any downtown hotel) from the airport, I suggest driving up the interstate and taking the 2nd downtown exit, as opposed to driving all the way up the strip... The strip will almost always be jammed with traffic, and unless you arrive at rush hour or happen upon an accident, taking the interstate can save you an hour or more in getting to / from the hotel.</p><br>Good stay, few minor problems<p>This was my second stay at Binions. The rooms have a coffee maker and hair dryer. The pillows are comfortable. One day the housekeeper failed to close my door after making up the room. The curtain wouldn't shut all the way; 3 days after reporting still not fixed. Plenty of noise from the Fremont Street Experience and the crane that goes back and forth on Fremont at night to replace bulbs. Love the snack bars. The bean and ham soup with cornbread is 3.50; tuna salad sandwich with tomato and potato salad 3.95. I ate at the snack bar 5 times in a 4 day stay. I played all my craps here - dealers are very good. An excellent value; I will stay here again.</p><br></body></html>
