<html><head><h3>Binion's Horseshoe Hotel & Casino Las Vegas Reviews Page 15</h3></head><body><br>Great Budget hotel<p>Just returned from another 2 night stay at Binions. In my last review, I complained about the plastic under the sheets on the beds. Maybe they listened, because this stay there was not any plastic, and the beds were very comfortable. Room was large and clean. Not the Bellagio by any means, but a great budget type hotel. Check in desk was very friendly, and they were able to accomodate my early arrival without any problems. Just make sure to get a room in the tower, and not above the casino.</p><br>BJ &amp; Slots at Binions<p>We did not stay at this hotel but wanted to post that we always love gambling here when coming to the DT area. The BJ tables are always fun and laid back. There used to be $3 tables but there were none this time... the lowest was $5.

Look for BJ dealer named Liz. She looks like a young Demi Moore and is tons of fun!

I usually have luck on slot machines here also. It just takes a little time to find the ones that are paying out but, once you do, you can walk out with a couple of hundred $$$$ if your lucky.</p><br>Uncomfortable Beds<p>What strange beds with plastic/rubber underneath the sheet that are very uncomfortable!!! Carpet is also dirty and tub is clogged. Elevator in parking garage is dirty and smelly. On positive note, this hotel gives good rates and in good location.</p><br>cheap rooms, not very nice<p>I used a 2-for-1 coupon. 2 nights for $66 total. Very disappointed with my room. Older than dirt, ice machine right outside my door sounded like a freight train all night.

I believe I got a crappy room because of the coupon. I know they have much nicer rooms.

I ended up winning over $2000 in the casino, so I could deal with the room.</p><br>Filthy, filthy, filthy!<p>Stay someplace else, anywhere else! True they do have cheap rooms, but would you like to pay to sleep in filth. We had a room booked for a week after a few days we moved to the strip. I like the gambling downtown but after my last visit I will NEVER stay there again. The room was absolutley the dirtiest hotel room I have ever seen. The cutains were ripped and stained. the carpet the same, as was the bedspread. The sheets had plastic on the bottom of them! REALLY! 4 lights in our room did not work, remote also, bathtub and sink did not drain. I asked repeatedly to have someone come and fix it and nothing ever happend. I called for an extra pillow, never got it. I complained to the general manager, Shaune, I believed her name was, she was so indifferent it made me feel like I wasn't even wanted at the hotel. Do yourself a favor and stay on the strip. You CAN find good deals. Oh by the way, I failed to mention the two cockroaches we found in the bathroom. I say again, filthy, filthy, filthy!</p><br>Beds were terrible<p>The beds were very hard and everytime you moved the rubber pad squeaked terribly. Our kids even complained! This was the worst bed I've stayed in. The room needed refurbishing badly. Very old and grungy. Never again.</p><br>Loved Downtown and Binions<p>Stayed for 2 nites at Binions at the end of my Vegas vacation. Chose Binions as the price was right for a Friday & Saturday night & so could experience Downtown after 2 weeks getting hammered on the Strip. I had previously stayed at Bellagio and Hooters and knew what I was getting into by staying at Binions. I found Binions pretty good. The room was a decent size and bed was comfy. Location on fremont is a plus. Would definately stay at Binions again. However would avoid the coffee shop for meals, mine was a bit dodgy (but the service was excellent).</p><br>Great hosts, good comps, be careful of old tower...<p>I stayed at Binion's twice this year. My first visit in Late April, right before the roof top pool opened. The rate was modest ($59) but the room was archaic and decrepit. On some level, this was a positive attribute as it gave me a taste of vintage "old style" Vegas. I didn't spend that much time in my hotel room anyway on that visit. My two biggest complaints: clogged tub drain and noisy A/C. However, that fourty year old hunker sure kicked out the ice cold AC. Also, I kind of liked the old wall paper and decor for nostalgic reasons.

The gaming was fabulous with many loose slots, single deck blackjack, and a nice assortment of liberal video poker machines. And, I liked the low limit craps! BTW, the comps are fabulous and you can easily accumulate free rooms and dinners and other freebies.

On my second trip in June I was given a "mini suite" on the 'Mint' side. This is where the newer rooms are located as well as the roof top pool and steakhouse. The difference in the rooms was night and day. I had a spacious room with several chairs and a table, a couch, huge closet space, climate control, and a modern bathroom that had its own little hallway. The carpet and bedding was clean and there was a fridge! BTW, this room was comped for 4 days from my previous visit. Also, they comped my previous hotel bill as well! I am not a massive higher roller either-just like playing dollar or quarter video poker and table games.

BTW, I just got comped for 6 nights in early January during the biggest conference of the year. This time I'm going to try out the Balcony rooms on floor 21, 22, or 23. Anyways, I learned a valuable lesson from some other guests I later joined up with: don't be afraid to ASK FOR COMPS! The worst thing they'll say is 'no.' Futhermore, if you're a moderate to serious player you'll likely get some freebies.

Also, I like that Binion's replaced the worn out carpet with identical new carpet stashed away years ago. And re-opening the snack room was a plus. Also, the poker room is really hopping again. Lets hope the new owners keep up the good work and invest resources into this classic property.

Jeffrey</p><br>Find somewhere else to eat<p>My wife and I are locals who have been visiting Binions since we moved here 12 years ago. We always enjoyed eating at the Coffeeshop whenever we were on Fremont Street, 3 or 4 times a year and when friends or relatives visited. Over the last year we have noticed a decline in the quality of the food and service. Last night was the last straw. The restaurant wasn't to busy but we ended up waiting 15 minutes before our waitress even took our drink order. Ten minutes later we received our drinks and our order was taken. Fifteen minutes for our appetizer, which was decent. Salad and soup 15 minutes later, food so far was OK. Fifteen more minutes for our entrees. Water glasses left empty. Waitress never came around to ask about our dinners or our empty water and by now drink glasses. A cup of a white liquid with the consistency of milk, which I later found out was supposed to be horseradish sauce had no flavor. There was a pudding like skin on the sourcream. The potato had to be cut with a steak knife and the prime rib couldn't be cut with a hacksaw. Left a 50 cent tip and complained to Jeff, a manager or busboy, I don't know. All I got was a blank stare. Payed our bill and we left. No apology, nothing but the same dumb blank stare. Wonder why downtown is dying? Visit Binions and you will find out.</p><br>Things are better<p>Glad to report someone is doing something about the status of the hotel at the Horseshoe (Downtown LV). The casino and restaurants have always been fine, but the rooms were really neglected. Hear they have started renovations from the top floors on down - we were on the 14th floor, so we got the benefit of new: bathroom fixtures, floors, seemed to be fairly new carpets, drapes, bedspreads, wallpaper, etc. but unfortunatley all in pink. Oh well. Can't report on the original hotel at the Horseshoe. Was put up there once, and while ok, would advise avoiding those rooms.</p><br></body></html>
