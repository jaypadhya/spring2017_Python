<html><head><h3>Binion's Horseshoe Hotel & Casino Las Vegas Reviews Page 3</h3></head><body><br>Nothing fancy.<p>Nothing fancy, but we just enjoy coming to Binions every time we go Downtown. The bartenders, waitresses, players club reps and everyone are very friendly and enjoyable. The food in the café is satisfying and quite reasonably priced. Gonna be back in October!</p><br>Great staff. Friendly and Professional<p>Had a great time at the Whiskey Licker Bar. Its an outside bar great for people watching. Bartenders were quick and friendly. My first trip to Vegas by myself and they made me feel like a regular customer. I had a great time joking with them about some of the strange people going up and down Freemont St. I stopped here every day on my 5 day vecation and started the party here.</p><br>Rocking bar atmosphere<p>While we were on a stag in Freemont St we called in here, the outside bar is right next to the stage and an elvis impersonator was performing, the atmosphere was brilliant, the bar staff were friendly and quick with a joke, we had a great time, would definitely call in again.</p><br>Great first time experience<p>We stopped in Binion ' s when we went to Freemont St and glad we did. Of course we got our pictures taken with the million dollars. We then signed up for the club card and got a certificate for a free ace in blackjack. My wife and I both played and both got a 2 for our second card and the dealer had 10. I took a couple hits and got to 16.. one more hit a 5 and I win against the dealer 20. My wife busted but continued to play for a while longer.

I walked around and played a slot machine losing only $.50 in ten minutes. I met my wife and we were ready to cash out. We went to the security desk and a nice young lady said she will show my wife the way. Come to find out she was the casino manager. She then offered to validate our parking but we left the ticket in our car. She said just tell the attendant that Trinity validated the parking.

You know it is a small thing but then we were only wagering a small amount but we were treated well and we will be back.

We had a great time. Thanks Trinity and Binion's</p><br>So Much Fun!<p>I visit Vegas a few times a year and have done so for the last at least 25 years. I haven't been to Fremont Street in 15 or so years. This time I decided to check it out again. I was very surprised at how much it has been cleaned up. We went to Binion's first. The first thing I noticed was how friendly and inviting the staff was. I signed up for a player's card and the man who helped me was probably the most helpful and friendly person I have ever encountered in a casino. His name was Bob. He told us where to go eat, told us about the promotions and anything else we wanted to know. He was so friendly that we came back to see him the next day as well! The slots are so much fun in this casino! Much better than the ones on the strip. The Binion's Café that Bob recommended was excellent. I had the biggest club I have ever had anywhere! It was excellent. My son had the chicken fried steak and it was amazing! The table games were fun and the dealers were very friendly. I earned free slot play the first day as well as a coupon for two for one for the café and a coupon for a free photo with a million dollars. The atmosphere downtown was so festive and fun, I will definitely be back to Binions on my next trip!</p><br>Casino is old school vegas<p>Loved this place. The food was great and the slots paid well. Loved the old school look of this place. slots paid very good, also the sports book had better odds than Cesar's. Get your picture at the 1000000'photo.
Room Tip: No hotel, but casino is great.

We had the photo taken and was told it would be half an hour. We was debased as we was heading to the airport to go home though we really didn't want to. The guys operating the phots shoots was told about us losing our brother and they got the photos done immediately. They was fantastic . They made two ladies very very happy a bit tearful but very grateful and happy. So a massive thank you to these two guys who went out of their way in customer services. Top marks xx</p><br>Fun and frequent pay outs<p>We did not stay at this hotel but had a better time at their casino than we did at our hotel!! Machines needed a little maintenance and getting beverages was not an issue. Crowded so others must have figured out the same thing we did...Binion's knows how to entertain.</p><br>Probably the best slots in Vegas.<p>The name still attracts visitors but it is the well managed slots and promotions that have me returning.Earn 40 points and you swipe and spin to win prizes.I usually win $10-$15 food comp but you can win free play or Binions swag.As for the slots they have a mixture of old and new.The Hangover and Family Guy seem very popular.Unfortunately,the downstairs cafe and hotel are closed.It has changed owners several times since Binions but the future looks brighter now.
Room Tip: No rooms open at this time.

The gambling in here is great- lower limits and an awesome variety of machines. The ongoing mother lode free swipe gives you free prizes for the gambling you were doing anyway. Prizes range from food comps, free chips, cash, and gifts. Two of our prizes on this trip were $10 comps at the coffee shop-2 of us ate and the bill was $0.00! Drink service is great and the staff are friendly and helpful.
Room Tip: Can get room comps or discounts at the Four Queens which is their sister property and another good c...
