We usually stay on the strip but thought we would try downtown. We arrived late in the evening and the room seemed hot--we set the temperature control at 40 degrees but the room remained at 80. The next morning we complained at the front desk and were given keys to a different room but it too was hot. A bell man brought different set of keys for another room and we thought this 3rd room was better so we packed everything and moved only to decide that the AC wasn't working there any better.
I called the 4Queens, booked a room there and we packed again and walked our luggage across the street. The room was nicer and the air conditioner worked!! So don't stay at the Horseshoe if it's hot outside.
The staff there was very nice though.</p><br>Not the Vegas experience you want!<p>Very cheap room so expectations were low, but tiny, dark, outdated room with torn carpeting and a cigarette burn in the blanket. Good place to store luggage but not my idea of a hotel room. Halls were an absolute maze (and dark), with overall layout not being terribly useful to anyone staying there. The coffee shop had a great prime rib dinner but if a good hotel experience is a big part of what you want your Vegas trip to be, keep looking.</p><br>Gambling, eating, sleeping ?? Binion's is as good as it gets..<p>Old? Hell yes it's OLD. It's a LEGENDARY House !! Gamblers' place to play? Hell yes it's THE place to play. Food? Hell yes, it's above Average and fairly priced !! I've stayed at Binion's at least 4 days each of the last 5 years. The Blackjack is as good as you find. The tables are as fast as you can get. The people are as NICE as you will ever find, anywhere in Vegas. The Dice tables are as rowdy and loud and fun-loving as you will EVER find. The food, at the deli bars or in the restaurant downstairs is as good as you will eat, anywhere in Vegas.
Binion's doesn't take a backseat to any of the fancy dan Strip casinos, if you are there for ACTION, and the gambling and the fun that goes with the people and the atmosphere. It's a smoky, dark, true to life Casino, with real people, Nice People, good players, and quality enjoyment. The 7 days I was there over Thanksgiving were as good as it has ever been and the rooms are not only Clean, but plenty spacious, with good TV, plenty of hot water, and all at a FAIR price. Once more, if you want Glitz and Glamor, hit the strip.. You want a real Gambling experience, a true casino atmosphere, an honestly fun trip and be within WALKING Distance of 11 Casinos for the change of scenery with ease, then Binions' HAS to be the place to stay. I have stayed in over 30 casinos in Las Vegas, and not one of them, from the GRAND to the Riv, Strat, Barbary, Gold, Hilton, Queens, Plaza, Nugget, Fitz, Stardust, Remo, Palace, or any other will exceed the fun, and the enjoyment of Binion's. Close proximity to the other casinos, and the canopy of Fremont street, and you just found an oasis in Vegas ----- All at Binions'.</p><br>Nascar weekend<p>Stayed on a busy weekend. Upon check in it was super fast the guy working elmer was super nice and even helped us later that night when we had forgot or room number. A friend of mine hit a $2000 jackpot on video poker the first 10 minutes there. The Steakhouse on the 24th floor had a AMAZING view of las vegas at night. But a tip the food it expensive for like $40 you get only a steak no potato no nothing oh bread, and it's good bread. But again if you have the money it's a awsome view. The Hotel rooms were old but not too bad at all. We had a problem with a person in the hallway sleeping which was prmoptly taken care of by security. I would proboly stay here again I like downtown and hte hotel was easy to get around. good valet service was provided and was always quick.</p><br>Squeaky stinky clean<p>This is an old, Stinky, motel with sqeaky beds and floors. The only redeeming value to this place is the fact that a housekeeping supervisor showed up right after we arrived to check on things (it was clean). the next morning I ask for a hair dryer (not included in the room) and it took almost 30 minutes to get it there (hair was dry by then). Carpets are all stained and they have NO, NONE, NOT ONE no smoking rooms. Even the towels smell like smoke. I am glad i did not bring a car or even rent one as I would have been scared to death to park it in this area. All in all i would not go back to this hotel and i would not recomend it.</p><br>Muita iluminação mas pouco conteúdo<p>O Binion's Horseshoe Hotel & Casino é um hotel consideravelmente antigo. Está na animada rua de Fremont, porém longe dos hoteis mais badalados da cidade. Não achei nenhum diferencial significativo no hotel em relação aos demais da região.</p><br>Genereux en alcool!<p>Vous desirez un verre avec beaucoupd'alcool? Binion's est l'endroit. Ils ne mesurent pas les portions. Les verres sont grands et genereusement arrosees d'alcool. Les prix sont raisonnables et rien de tel que de boire un verre assis sur une selle!</p><br>Pour la photo avec 1 milion de dollars...<p>Vieux casino de downtown, allez y pour voir et faire une photo devant un tas de 1 million de dollars posés devant vous...!
Vous faites la photo, il faut patienter environ 30mn pour la récupérer, c'est gratuit...et c'est fun...!</p><br>foto com 1 bilhão<p>hotel antigo na freemont, tem como principal atração a possibilidade de tirar foto com 1 bilhão de dólares, eles tiram a foto e a dão embaladinha em um encarte do hotel, é uma experiencia muito legal, fora isso é só mais um dos cassinos da freemont, sem nada demais</p><br></body></html>
