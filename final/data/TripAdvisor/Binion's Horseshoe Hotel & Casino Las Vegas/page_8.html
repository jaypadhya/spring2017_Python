They have $5 tables and are always busy. Interesting conversations mixed with frequent visits by the waitress make this casino a must visit. Visit Binion's and stay for the Fremont Street experience with the lightshow. I was ther St. Patrick's Day and it was the busiest I've ever seen it. The ultimate people watching spot!</p><br>By far the best Casino in Vegas<p>This is a fun place that gives back to gamblers. I enjoyed Binion's old Vegas decor. Got our free picture with a million bucks, it was a great place. I will be back.</p><br>Fun<p>To really get a feel for old Vegas you have to visit Binion's.

It's a fun place. From the million dollars in perspex to the cowgirl blackjack tables. The girl on the table i played was super cute. She wasn't the best dealer, and i did lose, but i didn't mind too much.

Bar prices are very reasonable too. I got a vodka and coke at The Mirage for $8, so i was highly surprised to see this cost $3 at Binion's. The bar staff were also very friendly and polite, and were very gracious about tips too, that was nice.

Now don't expect anything fancy like The Mirage etc, but really if you are in Fremont Street then you just really need to pop in. The place is steeped so much in Vegas history.

Food wise it's pretty basic, at least for my tastes. And they don't operate as a hotel any more, but go see it anyway.</p><br>Have you ever hugged a million dollars ?<p>We didn't stay here , but during our stay , we found out that Binions has an exhibit of a million dollars cash ..... So ...we strolled over there and sure enough , there sat the "great pyramid" of dough . The most pleasant surprise was that they take your picture with it and frame it ...FOR FREE! There were 4 of us and we received 4 framed pictures ....four separate poses ....huggin da money ! Do it ...it's a great souvenir !</p><br>Love this place!<p>I love to go to Binion's. They cater to the low rollers like me. I was able to sit down and enjoy a gambling session at a roulette table and not have to worry about losing a lot of money in a short time - that can happen in Vegas. Most roulette tables that I saw were $5.00 per spin, not at Binion's. I'm coming back. They also serve great meals in the diner.</p><br>Stay on the strip<p>I haven't stayed here as the hotel is closed but the casino is so much fun. We had a 2 weeks holiday in Las Vegas. Coming downtown away from the strip is a breath of fresh air! We did it nearly everynight!
The machines are fun and pay out way way way more then the Strip! As its a smaller casino all of the machines are played well, which gives better pay outs. And the drinks are extremely frequent. Every 10 minutes! (Rosie is a fabulous cocktail waitress here). On the strip you had to wait half an hour to have an order taken then another half and hour to get your drink, and that was in most of the hotels. Downtown is completely different. Even when you buy a drink its one fifth of the price of the strip. The steakhouse looked great upstairs, but we didnt get a chance to eat in it. It has a fabulous view too. There is a little Binions diner on the casino floor. Its so good and really cheap. Always a queue to get in but so worth the wait. You can have your photo taken with the million dollars for free which is something they would charge you at least $10 for on the strip. I will definately stay downtown the next time I come and if the hotel is open I will stay here for sure!</p><br>Cowboy funtown<p>Don't waste your time going to this run down dump. Unless you enjoy your 100 year old grandma dealing every card game, stay on the strip and spend your money where the atmosphere is better and staff are not rude...</p><br>poker with the greats.<p>Cafe rocks lowroller style, the casino is happening, the rooms are closed so stay at the sister property FourQueens across the street if you want to enjoy the rooftop pool at Binions. I play limit Hold'em in the legendary poker room, and at least enjoy the freeflowing booze even if the cards don't show. The room has some decent dealers, though they are a bit slack in handling players. Promotions for high-hands with low rake and $2hourly comp. The nights have played way better than days for me here, better action. Check-out the cowgirl dealers at 21, awesome outfits. If you can afford it, stay at GNugget, but play here. The fun downtown seems to focus at Binions. Outside on Fremont are music stages, performers, and the light canopy.</p><br>Stay in hotel<p>Helpful and friendly staff. Loved the poker room. Played here every day.
Room Tip: Stayed at the 4- queens north tower.
