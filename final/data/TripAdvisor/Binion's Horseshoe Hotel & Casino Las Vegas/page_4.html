There was a super fun mix of winning some and losing some. The people were friendly, and we simply had a really good time. After spending so much time on the south part of The Strip, we loved the laid back atmosphere here. We'll definitely be gaming in this casino again.</p><br>Get a free 5 x 7 photo of you and the million dollar display!<p>This rating is for the one million dollar display, one free 5 X 7 photos per person per day with one million dollars! Of course the money is encased in plastic on a table. But it's free and fun if you happen to be in the neighborhood! I call it a cheap thrill and free fun thing to do Downtown Las Vegas besides the Fremont Light Show. Parking in their garage is free only if you buy something from one of the eateries. So we bought a bag of popcorn and a drink to go</p><br>Beware of Parking Bait and Switch<p>I have parked in the Binions Parking Garage several times in the past while I played in their casino. In the past, you could validate your own parking by stamping your ticket by the casino cage...NOT ANYMORE! Now, despite the gigantic FREE PARKING in neon lights on the outside of their garage, you will only get free parking if you have a players card and play enough to earn 5 points on that card, and you have to have your parking ticket validated by taking your players card to the players club desk, stand in line (in my case for almost 10 minutes) have them verify that you earned more than 5 points before they'll validate it....So beware, if you're not a regular and don't have a players card you'll be out of luck! Completely ridiculous and employees were very rude about it....I WON'T be back, there are plenty of other options in Las Vegas!!</p><br>Take a picture with the millions at Binion's<p>We were told to come to this hotel as they offered a picture of you winning a million dollars at Binion's.. since we were already on Fremont st. it was worth the shot.. So we went in and found the place to be run down, so we made ourselves through to the picture booth. The hotel provided us 2- 5x7 pics at no charge taken by them and you were also allowed to snap a few pics off your cel or camera in which was very nice as it was the only hotel that offered something for free lol..</p><br>Best Casino in Freemont<p>Visited on a Tuesday night in August. There were some fun slots just inside the entrance, which allowed us to enjoy the music, light show and a nice breeze while continuing to play. Slots were loose and the beverage service/casino floor servers were the best we encountered in any Vegas casino, period. For those earlier reviewers experiencing lackluster beverage service, it seems that management has stepped it up. It was a favorite spot among all casinos, new and vintage!</p><br>Dirty and old, not vintage<p>All I can say is there is a reason why the hotel at Binion shutdown. The machines are tight, the staff is not the most friendly, drinks are not cheap compared to other casinos next to it. The place continues to go downhill, I believe it makes its only money by parking.</p><br>Defective slots and defective casino management and policies<p>My wife and I are staying at the Golden Nugget across from Binion's Horseshoe Hotel & Casino Las Vegas. We read it has a great steak house and was famous for poker play.

Today we went over to check out both. We planned on playing and eating there that night. On the way through the casino floor we saw a game that both of us enjoyed playing the last time we were in Vegas called Ribbit.

We knew the logic behind the game was to get one or two frogs around a pass in order to win free spins. My wife had put $57 in the machine, she had both frogs on the step (Lily pad) before the finish line, she had one frog with 22 spins the other frog with about 50 spins, and three extra spends that would go to either one.

We also knew that when you cross the finish line the more you play the more you win. My wife decided to change her bedding from $.50 to a dollar. When she did that, it wiped the game out completely, and reset everything to the start of the game.

We called over a technician who opened again and replayed what had happened, he also verified how much money we had put into the machine to play that game.

We had two managers come over to the machine they could see my wife had put $57 into the machine, they could also see that the game had errorred under normal play, and they told us the policy was they could only give us $5 back.

I said, you can see how much we put in the game right there on the screen, why can’t we have back what we put into the game? All we got back from the managers was the response that is not our policy, we can only give you $5. The senior manager then offered us dinner at their café. For those of you that can remember the show Mel’s Diner, you can think of the café at Binion's as that diner, but much much dirtier.

Because we were already headed to the steakhouse, my wife asked why can’t we eat at the steakhouse? Again the response was, because that is against our policy, I can only give you a free meal at our café.

Highly agitated we took the offer and as we walked away I said to the technicians standing there you better make sure you turn that game off. We went to the cage (cashier) to cash the ticket of the remaining money we had on the machine, and as we were walking out we saw all the technicians and the managers had left the machine on ready for the next sucker play.

We lost 40 bucks at the casino, compared to the $400 to $600 we would have lost on a nice steak dinner and a night of poker play. So why am I still so mad? Because I came to Vegas to eat steaks and play poker, and the very poor management at Binion’s ruined that for us for the night, and probably other nights also. We will not step foot back into that casino.</p><br>had such a blast at this fine casino...<p>cheap good drinks at the bar. fast and friendly bartenders, met some fun people at the car. played the slots won and had fun. great machines you cant find on the strip. went to the elvis museum and saw his car, was really cool. we had a great night. it was so much cheaper drinking here before heading to goldiggers. thanks horseshoe for the great service and made it a great night out.</p><br>Good to see an old friend!<p>My first trip to Vegas was over 30 yrs ago and my first place to gamble was Binions. It has been updated a bit but the old charm was still there with the dark wood and the mid nite steak. The picture in front of the million is different, but still there. I'm glad the smoky, boozy smell is gone. I enjoyed my couple of hours playing the penny slots. The drink ladies were a bit older, but took care of all the players and didn't sidetracked by some guy making a play. Some places in Vegas should keep to their roots and not get caught up in the fake plastic of Vegas. Sure was good to see you again Binions !!!!</p><br>Horrible<p>Staff was extremely rude, most of the machines were not working and not at all like the show. Came here because of the show I saw on TV. Nothing at all like it. It looks like a dump smells like a dump and all the staff was rude. Asked one person that worked there a question just ignored me and walked away and the other one looked at me like u was stupid. Staff in the steakhouse pretty crappy 2</p><br></body></html>
