<html><head><h3>Binion's Horseshoe Hotel & Casino Las Vegas Reviews Page 11</h3></head><body><br>Worked out great!<p>I was concerned after reading some of the earlier reviews written during Bionion's transition period, but I found their service to be outstanding. We moved to Binions from my conference Hotel to save money while I extended our time for some personal days. I had booked two rooms using a special rate and called to get the rooms adjoining since we were traveling with two teens (16 and 18). The day we moved hotels we took a day trip so we had a very late arrival at Binions which I called to let them know we would be arriving late. When we checked in they were out of standard rooms but offered us an outstanding suite on their 23rd floor for the same price. It had a full living room, dining room, foyer w/marble floors, two bedrooms and 4 bathrooms (2 full, 2 half). The balcony view was great and the room was more than I could have hoped for. Especially given the price. The location is also perfect if you want to be on Fremont Street. Even the valet parking was easy and efficient. No complaints from this stay.</p><br>Great Stay for the price<p>Stayed @ Binions Feb 14th to the 18th. Booked with expedia and used one of their promos on the website which I found an awesome deal of 40 buck for the whole stay which breaks down to 10 bucks a night. The stay was fine--was on the top floor--23 on a non smoking floor--the elevators were quick and speedy considering we were on the top floor. The room was basic. Descent size--bathroom and other things work properly. The decor was older along with the tv but its nothing I pay much attention to. I'm a budget traveler who is hardly in the room except to sleep and shower & considering it was 10 bucks a night it was a great value. I would stay here again in a heartbeat. The stay overall was a great value--non smoking room/floor. Had a coupon book and ate at the coffee shop with a 2-4-1 breakfast and have to say it was one of the best meals the whole trip.</p><br>Yuck, yuck.... and yuck<p>My wife and i now live near Vegas and had decided that we would 'sleep around' town and see what hotels were worth staying at. After booking a room at and staying at Binion's on Fremont street, i can say without any hesitation that this place needs to have the management horse whipped publicly!

The Casino was ok, the front desk staff and valet were nice but the room.... UUUGH! This room looked like it had never been updated since 1968, wall paper peeling and there was actually black smoke residue from an apparent fire in the room and the entire hallway. $49 a night was pure robbery! DO NOT stay here... do yourself a favor, walk across fremont street, pay an extra $20 and stay at the place that has the words gold and the word nugget in it. You will be doing yourself a huge favor.

Oh! And then we took some friends up to eat at the Binions ranch steakhouse (which i had eaten there twice before and was impressed!). After enduring crappy service, terrible food and an overall poor dining experience, they gave me a $250 bill! I paid it, tipped $20 (as i was doing the guy a favor at that) and swore to never give this place another dollar as long as i live.

You should swear to do the same.</p><br>One Night In A Mini-Suite<p>I love trying out new places especially downtown so I booked Binions for 1 night out of what turned out to be a 9 night stay due to snow. I only wanted to stay 1 night just in case it lived up to it's reputation! The registration gentleman could not have been nicer. He originally gave me a room on the second floor so I asked him if it was in the newly remodeled tower which he replied that the remodeling had not begun but will start in 2009. I must have looked disappointed because he looked in the computer again and said he had a mini suite available on the 12th floor, super! Well, it was not what I had envisioned. I probably would not have liked the regular rooms because the furnishings in the mini suite were old and worn. The carpet did look new, the bed was very comfortable but the bathroom was very small and the sink was so low that I couldn't imagine anyone over 5 feet being comfortable standing over the sink. As stated in a lot of the reviews, the windows were so filthy dirty that I could not get anything but a fuzzy picture of the view of the FSE. There was also a coffee maker in the room which is always a plus for me.

All in all my stay at Binions was enjoyable and would not rule out staying there again but would be careful of the choice of rooms given.</p><br>It's HOT...wether you like it or not<p>Stayed early December and the big story was the heat. Not outside, but in the room. 65 outside 80 in the room. Room never got below 78 for our two night stay. Called the front desk and was told they have a central heating sytem and the colder it was outside the warmer it got inside. So, if you stay in February, I assume the inside temp approaches 90.

The room was acceptably clean but showed lots of wear. Broken lamp shades, cig burns everywhere, 30 year old TV. As everyone says, the windows are crusty and it would have been great if they opened to let some of the heat out.

Got the room for around $15 a night from hotels.com. So, it wasn't a terrible value. Have stayed downtown at Golden Nuggett and Main Street Station and this a quite a step down.

A bright spot was the coffee shot. Good hearty fare at a fair price.</p><br>Overall Pleased<p>My husband and I went out in April just as a get away. We had already booked a room elsewhere on the strip, but we ended up going out a day early. Binions had a great rate available so figured we would try it and stay downtown one night. Although the rooms were showing wear, windows were dirty and bathrooms were not the best, the staff was great, beds were comfortable and the location was great. It is a great place for the amount of time that we actually spent in the room, which wasn't very much!</p><br>Good place to hang your hat<p>Stayed here on 12/15/08. It was cold and rainy, Vegas was a virtual ghost time. No wonder I was able to get a room for only $10.
This place is on Fremont St, home to the some of the oldest hotels in LV. These places( except for the Golden Nugget) tend to be smaller and less ornate than their counterparts on the Strip. They also generally cost less.This area had a reputation as a homeless haven, have noticed a lot fewer of them in the last few yrs. Ever since the Fremont St Experience was built, the area has become more upscale and vibrant .The area in front of the hotel is closed to car traffic, it's like an open air mall.
Room was at the end of the hall on the 4th floor. It was big enough for 2 people. There was a door connecting it to an adjoining room. Room was very spartan, but CLEAN and comfy. Rugs , ceilings and furnishings were a little worn. View from room was of the parking lot and Fremont St light show. Show was not running and street was deserted . Don't know how loud it gets when show is running.
Did not use pool or eat there.Good places eat in all price ranges within walking range.
Common areas were clean.
Staff was very good.
Short walk to parking lot , LV BL bus stop. Double deck Duece bus runs to Strip 24/7 . $2 each way or $5 day pass.Close to Cashman Ctr ,fwys, Greyhound Terminal ,and Children's Museum. It will cost more and take more time to get to airport than if u stay on Strip.
This place won't take your breath away, but it is ok if u want a place to sleep, shower ,and hang your hat.</p><br>You Can Do Better Than This Place<p>We spent a week here, and upgraded to a suite at check-in. The good part about this hotel is the staff. They were friendly and helpful. When we asked for anything, like extra coffee pods, or a hairdryer, it was delivered quickly, and with a smile. Another good thing about this hotel is that it is easy to get to the valet parking from your room, as the elevator is only steps away.

The real problem with this hotel is the condition of the rooms. The windows look like they haven't been cleaned in five years. The sink in the bathroom had about 5 burn spots. Three inches of the carpet was torn and worn away at the entrance to the bath. The tile was cracked in about 4 places. The tub looked blackened in places from age. The decor was late l980's. It was pretty dreary, and smelled of mildew. A light fixture above the TV blinked on and off even after maintenance "fixed it."

Further, the 4th night there, someone took a screwdriver and tried to break into our room, while we were in the room. The staff and security moved us to another room, but somehow I was still not really relaxed. Oh, and by the way, the room was in no better condition. I would urge you to stay elsewhere. They badly need to remodel, and improve their security. There are WAY too many choices in Vegas to stay in a dump that is unsafe.</p><br>Amazing value<p>Binions was by miles the cheapest accomodation on offer when we searched online so we booked through lastminute.com (travelocity) & with the 3rd night free offer on our Wednesday to Friday stay cost us only Â£38

After booking we became a little nervous as Lonely Planet told us that East Fremont Street was an unsavoury area of Vegas but when we arrived we saw we had nothing to worry about - Binions is situated amongst the Fremont Street experience which is bustling with people every night. You had to walk away from the Fremont Street experience a decent amount before we would start to feel a bit wary.

When we arrived Binions hadn't been sent out reservation by Travelocity & we had to wait 40 minutes before we could check into our room while they contacted them to confirm, though this didn't appear to be any fault of the hotels - there were another couple waiting for the same reason.

The curtains & bed throw looked a bit dated but the carpet appeared to be new & it was all nice & clean. The bathroom had plenty of hot water & good water pressure & there was a coffee maker. The bed was comfortable & we didn't have any issues with sound (we were at the back of the casino facing the freeway).

We enjoyed our stay so much we booked for another 3 nights which was slightly more expensive as we had to pay the weekend rate on Saturday but still by far the cheapest place we could stay.

For us who were doing vegas on a budget it was an excellent location, cheap places to eat nearby with decent priced liqour stores & the Deuce bus which travels up & down the strip started & ended its journey right at Fremont Street. If you happen to be arriving by Greyhound bus the station is within walking distance also.

Definately a great place to stay, especially on a budget.</p><br>Excellent stay<p>Just returned from a Thursday through Sunday stay at Binions. We usually stay at the Fitz or the Golden Nugget, but because we found at excellent rate online, we decided to give Binions a try this time. The staff was very friendly and helpful. We arrived around 2:30 pm on Thursday and there was no line at all for check-in. The room was pretty basic-- old furniture and an old TV, but clean and quite comfortable. My only complaint was there was VERY little water pressure in the shower. This may have been a problem in our room only, however, as my friend staying on another floor said hers was fine. Housekeeping did a great job and honored all our requests quickly and efficiently. Our room cost us a total of $89 for all three nights! If you need to be pampered, this is probably not the place for you, but if you're looking for a clean, comfortable room to crash in while you enjoy Fremont Street, Binions is definately a great deal.

The casino was great -- $5.00 tables even on Friday and Saturday night, lots of good video poker, and reasonably quick cocktail service. There aren't a lot of food options here -- the steakhouse is quite good, but I would give the coffee shop about a "C" rating. Your only other option at Binions is a couple of snack bars offering hot dogs and burgers, etc. This really isn't a problem, though, since the surrounding hotels offer some excellent dining possibilities.

Our trip was mostly a poker-playing trip. We expected a lot from the poker room and we were certainly not disappointed. The tournament poker room was great -- the dealers and tournament directors were friendly and extremely knowledgeable. They have a pretty extensive tournament schedule -- there were at least six per day, usually attracting 3 or 4 or more tables each. They have also recently opened a new, separate and very nice poker room used exclusively for cash games. Can't say enough about how much we enjoyed playing at Binions.

All in all, an excellent trip. Will definitely be going back to Binions very soon.</p><br></body></html>
