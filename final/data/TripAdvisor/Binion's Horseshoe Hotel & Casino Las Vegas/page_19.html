Could not get a room at the Nugget when we returned so we found a room at the Horseshoe. It was a pleasant surprise. Very nice staff, room was clean, nicely furnished, nice and firm bed, very pleasant room. The casino was above average for payback on your gambling money. We only ate at the little lunch counter and that was a show in itself. The gentlemen working there are very special, they made a sandwich lunch a real treat. Fun. I would not hesitate to stay there again.</p><br>Best deal in town!<p>Stayed at Binions the weekend before Thanksgiving. Booked the room by calling directly to the hotel. friday, saturday and sunday was $121 including tax. small room with comfortable king size bed in the west side. Maid service was exemplary and filled all requests for extra towels, pillows and blankets.

Casino action wasn't real good. Gambled across the street at the Golden Gate.

Next time, I'll stay here and play in the daily poker tournaments.

Why stay on the strip when you can get around Fremont Street safely and easily. If you want to go the strip you can catch the bus a few blocks away for a $5 day pass. Be sure to catch the 802 as it stops less often and gets you to and from the strip quicker than the 801.

Granted the rooms aren't like they are on the strip but I'm here to gamble and tour Vegas not stay in my room. If i want to stay in my room I'd stay at home.</p><br>Just got back<p>Just got back from a trip to Las Vegas where we stayed at Binion's Horseshoe. Had a great time. I've previously stayed on the strip where every trip to another casino seems like a hike. But not on Fremont street. There are about 10 casinos within 5 minutes walk. The light show is great.

The rooms were spares, but clean. The staff was fantastic and the price was unbeatable. I'll be back to the Horseshoe.</p><br>hate the change<p>binion's horseshoe has been turned into a harrah's. the floor plan is the same. I've been going to the horseshoe for over 10 years. i hate all the changes and so do a lot of other customers. the help isn't crazy about the changes either. i'd really like to be able to contact MTR directly to voice my concerns.</p><br>great!<p>this year, we discovered Downtown Las Vegas: lodging, casino, restaurant, entertainment
(we already went on the Strip in 2002)
hotel : Horseshoe : clean and beautiful rooms for
a small budget, the casino seems a little "dark" but it's old Las Vegas!!!!!

located just in Fremont street : "magnifique!"
"ambiance retro et magique"... completely different from the Strip.... to discover absolutely after sunset: jazz in the street, Fremont Experience:all these lights with music .... really great...

(sorry if mistakes... usually, I speak French..)</p><br>interesting start<p>Stayed at Binions in early July 2004, I called and confirmed our reservations the day before for a room in the east tower, with a view. We arrived late, due to flight delays to find that they had given our room away and only had "one room left". This turned out to be a shoebox room on the older west side. The room was so small we could barely move around it, the airconditioner was so loud it sounded like a coffee grinder and our "view" was of a brick wall. I didn't sleep at all the first night as I was furious! The next morning they gave us another room. (I had to get the key) The room was better but we found the air didn't work. Again I complained. We ended up in a room on the 21st floor, with a beautiful view, and an extra bonus of a living room with balcony. This was old but clean and cool. They also comped the last two nights. So moral of story is don't be late and let them know if you are unhappy.. they will make it right!</p><br>Not bad for $39 on a Saturday night<p>I was in Las Vegas for 4 nights at the end of July. I stayed Saturday night at Binion's. For $43 (including taxes), it was a decent place . Even though I requested a room in the "East-side tower", I got a room in the "old" West side section. It's the old 3-story "maze"-like section, which I learned is the original section of Binion's hotel. Most rooms have no view out the window--mine was in front on Fremont St. But I faced the backside of the 4-story Binion's neon-light "wall" on Fremont st, so I had no view of anything . Oh well, it was just a cheap room on Saturday night. I arrived too late to use the roof-top pool, but the view from up there is awesome! The casino is very "sparse" looking, or you might say "spread-out"; I play mainly slots and VP but there was plenty of open space on the casino floor. I wish they would've had a better selection of slots and VP. All employees were very friendly and nice. The location is great for downtown. Room was small but clean and had everything you need--King bed, TV, small bathroom, small table with 2 chairs. Snack bars had strange hours and I didn't eat at any of the restaurants on-site. After my one night downtown, I enjoyed the rest of my time on the strip, as I got bored with downtown and ended up gambling more than I wanted to that night and morning ............downtown is definitely a better place for those who are in Vegas ONLY to gamble--I like to gamble and do other things, so I prefer the Strip.</p><br>Can't Complain<p>First visit to Binions and was a little scared by the reviews from past. We stayed 7/30-31. The room was OK, old but clean. No room service, no fridges in room, no safe and in pool area only 5 lawn chairs. However, we asked if they would open the pool earlier (7am instead of 10am) and they did. All we had to do was ask. 2.95 breakfast was good but have to arrive before 7am. Did well in casino and employees were very friendly. All in all room rates worth it. Plan on returning if they are still open next year.</p><br>Saved a $ at Binon's<p>Stayed when it was still owned by Binon's. Good room for $60, nothing fancy, but clean, great view of Freemont street off the balcony. Maybe all the complainers should have spent $250/night over on the strip!</p><br>Nostalgia, Nostalgia<p>We stayed at the Horseshoe on June 13th and 14th of 2004 at what I thought was a good rate ($39.) If you stay above the 20th floor you get an outside balcony that you can actually sit on and enjoy the city lights. We stayed on the 21st floor on the side that looks out toward the strip and really enjoyed the lights at night. Yes, it's an older hotel but we really enjoyed the nostalgic feel of the place. The bed was comfortable and we had a non-smoking room. All in all it was a pleasant stay. We're looking forward to staying there again next month.</p><br></body></html>
