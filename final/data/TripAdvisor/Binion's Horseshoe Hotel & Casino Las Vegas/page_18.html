<html><head><h3>Binion's Horseshoe Hotel & Casino Las Vegas Reviews Page 18</h3></head><body><br>Value for money<p>After reading reviews we were ready for some pitfalls. We paid about Â£20 per night and the room was huge. The furnishings are a bit 1950's/retro but clean and tidy and that's what Fremont Street is all about. We didn't have any of the nasty smells people talk about. We were overlooking the Fremont Street Experience and so could hear the noise from that until midnight. But you know the saying 'if you can't beat 'em join 'em' so we did and if we were going to sleep before midnight we used earplugs rather than have a different view. Overall it was excellent value for money, the breakfast in the Coffee Shop was exceptional value as mentioned by another reviewer and I would definately stay on Fremont Street again rather than at the themed hotels I've stayed at before. The experience is great.</p><br>Binion HorseShoe LV -This's not a hotel for me. Too old and smell and expensive<p>I just got back from LV (5/30/05). I'm so regreted that I booked for this hotel, I don't game a lot,just like to stay and enjoy entertainment and food, but this hotel is ruined my stay, it old and dirty and smell bad. When I am tired from a day, I don't want and scare to get back to my room to get rest because of its smells so bad. I just only came back for the night to sleep. That's terrible, even I am tired I can not go to my room for resting. I paid $105 per night, and for a bad room. It is too expensived. Only one thing that I give them a credit is the staff are nice. But over all, this hotel is not for me at all. I do not recommend for any one to come for your stay in las vegas, look for other hotel when you want to stay in downtown. Next time, I'll stay at the trip, it always is the best location when you go to las vegas.</p><br>Never come back again, Expensive, old and smell bad !!<p>I just got back from LV, I am very very disappointed at the Binion. I paid at 3stars hotel rate at the trip but 1 star for this hotel. That's mean it is very expensive ($102 per nights). And I hated it. It smell terrible and room dirty. I don't recommend any one to book for this hotel. Go to the trip better, at least you pay for what you stay. But here is overcharged...</p><br>Prepared for worst...but experienced the best!!!<p>I read all the negative reviews of Binions, but my experience could not have been better. I had problems finding a room for a Friday night, but took advantage of their $59 rate special. I walked from the bus station (yep, the bus!) I had taken from Phoenix at 6:15 am to the hotel, and began by going to the downstairs coffee shop; for $2.95, 2 eggs, 2 strips of bacon, a heaping plate of hash browns, toast. The waitress was friendly, and the coffee shoproom is decorated with wood trim; very pleasant!

I couldn't check in until 3 pm, but checked my luggage in; the hotel gave me a number to call to check on my room; again, very friendly. When I checked in, they gave me excellent directions; simple -- elevator up 4 floors only 10-20 steps from the registration desk. The room was amazing! -- about 20 by 20, fresh, new green carpet, a comfortable couch with 2 wingback chairs, nice table, huge comfy king-sized bed. Even remember the room number -- 404. It's a mini-suite; ask for it.

I totally enjoyed the Freemont Street experience that night, the ease with getting around downtown, and a great, prime-rib dinner at Fitzgeralds for $8.95. I joined up with my brother the next day at MGM Grand; the strip has gotten too congested and the room was not as nice!

My experience at Binions could not have been better -- as Ahnold would say, "I'll be back!"</p><br>scared at first by bad reviews, but glad we went<p>I have been to vegas 5 times and love staying downtown, staying at the golden nugget or the fitzgerald never at binions. When we booked or trip everywhere else was sold out so we had no choice. Heard lot of bad things but none of them true. There was 8 of us we had 4 rooms some of the rooms were smaller then the others, but rooms were cleans and nice. I will go back to the binions everytime for now on. The price was right the service was good. Dont let the bad reviews scare you off beautiful place to stay. Thank You Binions</p><br>Awful, awful, awful!<p>We had reservations since January and they still tried to make 3 of us sleep in a room with ONE double bed. They had already given all the single people that had come in that day all the rooms with TWO beds in them!! We asked for non-smoking and they gave us smoking, ok so big deal , but when we got to the room and opened the door it was if someone had just smoked in there. Also our shower head was held on by a twist tie, yep I said Twist Tie! Very stinky , smelly rooms and the hallway had the ceiling falling down. I wrote to the hotel and got the response that a new company now owns it and will look into the matter, then they invited me for a FREE STAY!??! Are you serious? When I went that night to tell them about my shower head (it wouldnt stay still and faced the wall once turned on), the front desk was sooo rude and said, that we werent the only ones in this situation. I found out later that the people next door to my room had no air-conditioning for the last 3 nights and there were 4 in their party in a room with ONE double bed and they had put reservations since Dec. His kids slept on the floor (no extra roll-aways). At least we got a roll-away. Never again.</p><br>Loving it at the Shoe!!!<p>Stayed at Binions Horseshoe April 9th-13th and all my husband and I can say is that they are the best of the best!!!
They have a wonderful poker staff--that's mostly all we played while we were in town and they have the sweetest dealers and poker hosts!! Thanks Tish, Patty, Ethan for everything--and funny Zircon! The people that frequent here are just as nice, mostly locals but all very nice!
But the best thing about Binions was the Coffee Shop!!! I am not kidding here when I say this may be the best food in Las Vegas--who would think right?? A coffee shop in the basement of a downtown hotel!! Really, their food is so good and very cheap!!! Please try, you won't regret it at all--and if you play poker long enough they will be more than happy to comp your meal!!!
Our room rate was $25 a night, and really you can't do wrong here--don't go looking for a suite, with a butler and fresh fruit. This room was basic and it worked. Beds were comfortable, shower pressure good, and the room was clean! So if you want to stay downtown Las Vegas, stay at the Shoe!!! We will be back in 2 months and can't wait to see all the nice folks again.</p><br>absolute disgrace at binion's<p>Binion's horseshoe is a total rip off. The place is dirty, the rooms were below average and the personnel at the front desk were rude and inconsiderate. Next time in downtown Vegas I will stay at the golden nuggett. Anyone who stays at the horseshoe is making a major mistake.</p><br>Great times at the Shoe<p>This was my third trip to Las Vegas and by far the most excellent. During my last two experiences in Vegas I stayed at Treasure Island and The Venetian. Both were very high class and I had an okay time. Staying on Fremont Street is an experience that everyone should have. The "Shoe", as it came to be called by my friends and I is the only place that I will ever stay in Vegas. The value cannot be beat. The rooms are clean and the dealers and staff are friendly. Make sure that you say hello to Bobby that works the bar by the poker area and make sure that you visit the little coffee shop . . . steak and (great tasting) lobster for 10 bucks. I've been home for 2 days and I'm making reservations for next month. Do the "Shoe".</p><br>Should live the experience!<p>My husband and I stayed here one night during our most recent visit so we could live "The Freemont St experience". The hotel was clean & inexpensive. Prior to this visit we stayed at Paris LV (twice), Riveria, & NY NY. We had not ventured out to this part of town. We had to wait for a room so we changed and went to the roof to take a swim three girls were making out in the pool and a homeless person was sleeping in a lounge. Within five minutes of our arrival hotel security was on the roof escourting him out (thus our venture began). Later in the day the same person was sleeping in a vibrating chair in the hotel lobby. We walked the streets, shopped, and watched the shows that night -- very interesting crowd. When we went to bed the lights and noise were incredible but because I read reviews like these, I was prepared and brought ear plugs and eye blinders (yup blinders)... Both came in quite useful as the room vibrated with the noise from the streets and the light show could be seen (flashing) through the drapes. This was a great experience. One I enjoyed and will never forget. If you're adventurous this is a fun detour from the norm.</p><br></body></html>
