<html><head><h3>Binion's Horseshoe Hotel & Casino Las Vegas Reviews Page 13</h3></head><body><br>Decent and clean, great value.<p>I was in Vegas for a bachelor party and when my friends left, so did the room I was sharing at TheHotel at Mandalay Bay. I had another 5 nights to myself in Vegas, and no room. I figured I'd try Binion's for a night, since it was cheap, and if I liked it I'd stay.

I checked in on Sunday afternoon. The girl was not courteous, a bit like I intererrupted her calm afternoon. Definitely not very professional. She was kind of slow getting me checked in, kept checking for rooms. I know how to handle someone like her though - the natural tendency a person has is to get impatient and angry, and I was anxious to get into my room, but I just smiled and patiently waited and said "Don't worry, I'm not in a rush" (even though I was). So, I went from being the pain in the ass customer to being the friendly, patient customer. Result - I got a nice room on the next to top floor, with a balcony!

The room is old. It is not fancy or trendy or "high end". Many might call it cheap or tacky. But it had a table and a couple chairs, dressers, a TV, a very comfortable king bed, a bathroom witth towels and soap and shampoo, and everything was very clean. I was paying between 30 and 35 bucks, how can you go wrong with that for a clean, decent room? You can't.

I was willing to stay more nights, but when I checked with the front desk they didn't have any more nights available at my rate, and the rate was almost double.

Like most of the lower-end downtown hotels, this place is great if you get a good rate and just need a clean, safe, no-frills, comfortable place to sleep, shower, and dress while you're out having fun the rest of the day and night.

Oh, and I gave it a 4 because I got the balcony, but if I got a regular room without a balcony it would have been a rating of 3 out of 5.</p><br>Don't stay here<p>We just wanted to stay on Freemont Street once to see the Freemont Street experience and have a cheap room for the one night. The hotel staff at check in was awesome; they even let us check in at 11:00. I was expecting old and tired so that was not surprising. However the noisy plastic over the mattress, the stained furniture, mold in the bathroom and the roach on the wall next to the elevator was inexcusable. It was hot and the air conditioning did not work. Overall it was an awful stay and pushes the boundaries of what you will and will not do versus sleeping in your car.
The Freemont experience was fun and entertaining. The food on that strip is cheap and very good. I recommend doing the Freemont Street Experience at least once but stay elsewhere.</p><br>If rude and smelly are for you<p>We went to the Binion's as a last resort after a booking mistake elsewhere. I feel like sleeping in the car would have been a better choice. The front desk staff were at the best untrained at the worst down right rude and unprofessional. We stood at the front desk going through the check in process that everywhere else I have been takes at the most five minutes, here took 25 minutes. During that 25 minutes rooms disappeared then became available. My credit card was needed 6 different times and the key card machine was pounded on to "fix" it. After everything was said and done we went to our room which looked as if a crowbar had been used to pry it open and our keys didn't work. So back to the front desk where I had to wait in line for 20 more minutes. They then just assigned us to a different room, without an apology for the inconvenience. Once we finally got into a room, that again looked as if a crowbar had been used to open it, it smelled. We were all smokers and it reeked. The room was so hot it was uncomfortable to sleep. The beds were horrid and made horrendous noises when you rolled over. I don't know much about the rest of the accommodations because as soon as we woke up we high tailed it out of there, but not before a staffer yelled through the door ensuring that we were checking out that day. Overall, it was a terrible start to a vacation. The staff was rude and unprofessional (as one front desk employee said she was "the hell out of there, and she wasn't staying for another minute and that we were not her problem anymore."). When we asked to speak to a manager we were blown off and told that we could talk to one tomorrow. Needless to say we won't be back.</p><br>Nice Stay<p>I stayed at Binions on a Saturday night the price was only 69.00. The room was clean, old, but clean. We stayed in room 1815 and we were a little surprised the window opened the whole way...Not very safe, we did contact the front desk they said they'd take care of it. The room came with a vanity, but no hair dryer. There was a small coffee maker and TV. Overall we had a nice stay, nothing fancy we were not expecting it either.</p><br>Travel Alert: Pool unavailable<p>I have never stayed at Binion's but was planning to make a reservation for May 1-3, 2008. I called and the rude desk clerk told me that the pool and cafe were undergoing renovations, so if swimming or dining is important to you or your family and friends, don't stay at Binion's!!!</p><br>small but comfortable<p>I stayed at Binions using the ACG but 1 nite get one free...
They let me check in early about 11 am I was on the 17th floor
I smoke so they said the smoking rooms were bigger, so I opted...
Well even for me.... the room smellled of smoke so bad, it really reeked, I had already unpacked so I just went to the walgreens and bought some Febreeze.... that halted the smell for awhile...
When I went to the casino, the big center stage was GONE!!! I was here in JAN and enjoyed the little cowgirl dance show... well NO MORE.... just an empty space.... I did win a little here but the drink service was poor.... no waitresses hardly at all, .
I wanted to eat at the cafe but they were under renovations so I setled for a cheeseburger at the deli ( good ).
I ventured out to the El Cortez to use my free 10slot pay.... LOST THERE..... went to 4 Queens....lost there.... came back up by vegas club... lost there.... deciede to go get my shrimp cocktail at the golden gate and then back to my room at binions.... the tv had limited channels , but overall it was comfy for the nite...
The next day, I went to the Viva Las vegas show.... I really enjoyed it, I had used a free coupon so even made it better, i caught one of the T-shirts worn byt he show girls and my son will like it... I had upfront seating and our table was the but of many jokes by the Host...... it was great.... I will see it again.
This time for gambling I went to Fitzgeralds..... YAY I always do well there.... back to Binions... Overall stay was nice. The staff are nice, but the drink service is very very poor after 2am no waitresses could be found.
I hope they put the dancing girls stage back, or at least fill itup with slots or something. I will be back to visit the cafe and the steakhouse.
i dont think I would stay there again unless it was cheaper than the 59.00 I paid and I get A NON SMOKING ROOM</p><br>Good Prime Rib dinner<p>I did not stay here but ate at the cafe downstairs twice.

Had a wonderful prime rib dinner for lunch. I think it was $8.99.

Went back for dinner and had yummy ham steak and eggs for $5.95</p><br>Can't beat the location and affordability<p>My boyfriend and I stayed here for a mini-vacation from California. The truth is it was one of the cheapest hotels in the area for a weekend stay. Two weeks prior I had stayed at the 4 Queens and really enjoyed my "Freemont Experience" so I figured I would make a return. I liked how everything in the area was so accessible.

The Positives:
Parking was a breeze (garage wasn't too crowded), location is right in the mix of things, room was spacious and bed was large and checking in and out was a breeze.

The Negatives:
The pool is closed for renovations (no biggie just take yourself and a towel across the way and enjoy the pool at the Golden Nugget), the walls are pretty thin and we happended to be right across an ice machine so we heard everyone filling up.

All in all, it is a budget accomodation and what it lacks can be made up at one of the other casinos who are more than happy to welcome you as well. :-)</p><br>Had a Good Experience at Binion's<p>I (solo) stayed at Binion's February 27 & 28. I was able to check in at 12:10 which was nice. I was in a nice, clean, room in the Mint Tower with a King bed. It was good sized with a table/chairs and another writing desk/chair. The air conditioner worked well and was quiet. The water was hot/cold as desired. The room was clean. The staff was fine.

I ate at the snack shop and had the big ham breakfast at the coffee shop which was really good. I look forward to staying at Binions again.</p><br>Not Happy with Hote or casino<p>Stayed through New Years Eve. Room was very loud. Window were facing Fremont Strip, we were not able to sleep due to the noise. Rooms were extremely hot. Had to leave windows open to sleep. Played Texas Holdem-Pit Boss was not professional. De-graded dealers in front of players. We actually did a written complaint about the pit boss. Hotel is in need of remodel/clean up. Would not recommend staying.</p><br></body></html>
