<html><head><h3>Binion's Horseshoe Hotel & Casino Las Vegas Reviews Page 2</h3></head><body><br>Fun Casino<p>Didn't stay at the hotel but played plenty in the casino during our visit to downtown vegas. The casino staff were friendly and helpful, drink service was good to even though it was pretty busy. Had a blast playing some of the worst odds in the casino on the wheel, played for hours on the same 20 bucks me and my group put down and the staff running the wheel made it that much more fun. Will be going back there in the future to gamble even though after awhile the tables and slots eventually started taking our money back, but at least we had fun doing it!</p><br>Big<p>Love this casino on Fremont St it's big, clean , slots & plenty of tables which are a lot more reasonable to play than the casinos on the strip. It's even got a sports book. Staff is friendly and helpful, & drink servers are plentiful. Great place to go to when your tired of the craziness on the strip.</p><br>Binion's in Downtown Las Vegas is on oldie but a goodie !<p>Good slot gambling and some $5 tables for Blackjack & Roulette. They have taken out the pizza / bar joint and replaced it with a BBQ place. There is a Cafe inside also with a burger and fry combo for $4.95. Roll is very nice , hamburger is so thin you could read a newspaper thru it , but the fries are delicious. Good for a midnight snack ....besides...what do you want for $5 ? Service is just okay for a diner type setting.</p><br>Fun, old school Vegas<p>Dealers are friendly, great old school atmosphere. The overall Fremont Street experience is always our playground when we go to Vegas, especially when walking from one casino to the next. A must for anyone gambling on Fremont Street.</p><br>Don't play or stay here.<p>Are you kidding me? Casino smells from 50 years + of cigarette smoke. Dealers that just got out of dealing school. God forbid you're winning; they'll accuse you of cheating or change your betting habits. This is NOT a player friendly casino.</p><br>With $10,000 we'll be BINIONAIRES!<p>The highlight of Fremont street for us. A great old-school feel casino that even has a great BBQ restaurant inside. We had great fun playing Roulette on the $5 tables and the bloody Marys at the bar were great.

I love that Binions have kept a bit of the old school downtown vibe instead of modernizing (and sterilizing) like many other Fremont St casinos. Love the brick internal walls.

Never change Binions!</p><br>Gamble and View<p>Fun gambling and taking in the sights. Play machine close to Fremont Street the best entertainment you'll ever have! Waitstaff very attentive you don't have to wait for your drinks they're on it! Progressive machines are a must. Bunions Casino is a part of Vegas history definitely worth the walk down Fremont Street to play.</p><br>Good times, good casino.<p>Hubs and I had a great time gaming in Binion's. It's very old school but the staff was friendly and next time we visit we will probably stay here. It also seems that the slots are loose here. All around fun!</p><br>Nice Win<p>While hanging out on Freemont street for an evening eating junk food(fried oreos yum), zip linning, ongoing concerts, and people watching we went into Binions to Play a few slots and check out the Poker Hall of Fame.
My wife loves to older style Wheel of Fortune slot machines. They had a few.
So she played this one for a bit and got to Spin the Wheel and hit the highest amount on the wheel. $1000. She was a happy camper.
They always say that the Downtown Machines pay out better. True or not I do not know but it was our best hit of the trip.</p><br>Old vegas classic<p>I have to let everyone know how nice the staff was at binions. Anna the lady at the service desk was so nice to us. Went there a few times during our trip. First just me and a friend. We had such a good time that we brought some family members to see this gem the next night.. We were staying on the strip at a very nice hotel and honestly could not get the kind of service there that we got at binions. Yeah its a little rough looking but they sure know how to treat you well.. Also i think the casino host name was Joel.. Want to say thank you to him as well</p><br></body></html>
