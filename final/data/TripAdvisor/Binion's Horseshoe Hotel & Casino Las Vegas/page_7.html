<html><head><h3>Binion's Horseshoe Hotel & Casino Las Vegas Reviews Page 7</h3></head><body><br>Amazing Time!!<p>Had a great time gaming at Binion's!! Was able to meet and get pictures with Jana and a few other people from my favorite show Casino Confidential!! All the staff was super friendle, what a great environment! Binion's cafe was amazing, ate there a bunch of times! The Hangover Burger is a must!!!</p><br>Will NEVER Return to the Casino!<p>I spent a couple of hours one evening at the bar playing video poker having a great conversation with a nice older bartender drinking what I thought were "complimentary" drinks since I was playing when a younger and rude bartender approached me and in a negative tone of voice informed me "You must play all 5 coins at once in order to receive complimentary drinks!" I was shocked and looked over at the older gentlemen who had been servicing me ALL evening for explanation to which that bartender never once made eye contact with me. Instead, I had a confrontation with the younger bartender. I eventually walked away, free of charge but NEVER will I return to this casino! And for the record, is this a rule "5 coins must be played at once in order to receive free drinks at casino's?" Cause nowhere did it read or was verbally shared. Just saying...
Room Tip: Avoid sitting at the bar. If you do, all 5 coins of poker must be played at once at the video games...

Asked binions manager for help all he said come back tomorrow. No help what so ever. Actually walked away from me when i was talking to him.

I will never go back to binions casino.</p><br>I like the steak house at the top<p>I have never stayed at the hotel but if you like steaks with a incredible view this is the place to go, the prime rib and baked potato are fantastic not cheap but worth the price, if it's the weekend make a reservation the staff is very friendly I ate there last night, make sure and go out to freemont street and watch the lite show and free concerts</p><br>Always a Fun time at Binions<p>Nothing better I love than Comps n Coupons. Although we have yet to win big here its always a good time. getting picture taken with the Million is a nice cheery on the cake. I like the Cafe and watching the cooks food is good. Service is fast if you time it right. Bartenders and wait staff are as fast as they can be. The players club staff are friendly as well. Wish I was there now.</p><br>Pool<p>We were sent to this pool as our hotel didn't have one. The pool needed to be re-tiled as there were big holes in the plaster. The painting on the bottom of the pool was neat. But I think there was poop on the bottom of the deep end.</p><br>Binions Cafe and service in casino<p>It was getting late on Friday night, and everywhere to eat had long lines, except Binion's Cafe. We saw why. We didn't mind the self-seating, plastic cutlery, or coffee served in a large syrofoam cup (actually liked that), but that's the end of the good. Menu is very limited, and high priced compared to any other cafe downtown, especially considering the atmosphere. Kitchen area, easily seen from seating (also has counter seating) looked dirty, with lots of 'stuff' (not sure what it was) stacked on a shelf type thing at end of counter. Food was bland (although fries were okay), Philly cheesesteak served open-face had zero taste at all, nothing. You'd be better off going next door to Mermaids and getting 99 cent hotdogs.

Played machines in casino (decent return) but service was bad. Glasses, bottles, etc. on top of/along side machines everywhere. Many unemptied ashtrays also sitting. Although she was tipped, only saw a cocktail waitress twice in 2 hours (and unless empty was handed to her, it sat where you put it). Guy did come and empty my ashtray (once) but others were untouched and glasses, etc. remained. Staff (server, cashier cage, clean-up, cafe) seemed uncaring and acted like doing anything was a burden to them. Only person seen 'working' was an older oriental guy in the Cafe, cleaning off tables and getting people drinks. He was hussling non-stop.

Although owned by the same corporation now, the difference between Binion's and Four Queens is night and day (see Four Queens review).</p><br>Big gaming fun definitely a vegas must on freemont street<p>I stayed on the strip but we ventured over to old freemont street to see old vegas & we gambled here it was a great time, plus they give you 3 free pictures with 1 million dollars which is nice. We didn't win here but it was nice to see the old vegas & just get away from the strip.</p><br>Review for the Binion's Deli<p>Yum, Yum, Yum! We ate here a couple of years ago when we first arrived in LV late at night. We sat at the bar and had some scrumptious late night nibbles. Highly recommend this joint. Cheap, tasty, and filling. Good quality and a down home feel.</p><br>Down on its luck but worth a visit<p>Binion's has fallen a long way since it was the epicenter of poker. The hotl is no longer open, the joint isn't the cleanest, and the fabled poker room is often near-empty.

But...some of my most enjoyable, pure Vegas moments have been at Binion's and I am still a fan. Cheap roulette, craps, and blackjack -- a poker room manager who knows what he's doing and runs decent tournaments. I've seen bridal parties eating in the old cafe, and a bride in full regalia eating a burger alone at the lunch counter.

That lunch counter happens to serve a killer bean soup with homemade cornbread that is one of Vegas's best cheap meals. Their "hangover breakfast burger" (cheeseburger with bacon and egg) isn't half-bad, either.

Have a kitschy photo taken standing next to a million bucks and say a silent prayer that "the place that made poker famous" will see better times.</p><br></body></html>
