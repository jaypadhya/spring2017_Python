<html><head><h3>Binion's Horseshoe Hotel & Casino Las Vegas Reviews Page 9</h3></head><body><br>Benny Binions 83rd birthday party at the Thomas Mack Arena.<p>Stayed in the 1st room up the steps from casino. It was the ultimate nights in Vegas.</p><br>Don't waste your money on the strip<p>We always stay downtown. Even a low roller can get rooms, meals etc comped downtown. The Fremont Street Experience is a fantastic light show that is different every hour all evening. There is entertainment of all kinds up and down the street. You don't have to pay for transportation to get from one casino to another. The people in the casinos are friendly and take time to teach you the games if you are new to gambling. If you are farmilir with Blackjack you can play in the Party Pit in the front of the casino with young girls dealing and even a dancer. Action is fast and FUN. The rooms at Binions are being remodeled and they hope to have them all refinished by next summer. They will rival if not beat any romm on the strip with class and luxury! There is a marvelous, reasonable buffet at the Main Street Casino around the corner with a huge selection. Try downtown. You will not be disapointed!</p><br>Pleasantly suprised<p>Received an offer for two free nights at Binions, and though what the heck, might as well take it, this also included $40.00 in slot play and 2/1 dinner. At first I was a little scared and thougth the rooms would be dumpy, but they are not, sure the room is old, the curtains were ripped and worn about by the sun, but the room was extremely clean, the washroom was a good size and there was plenty of counter space. The pool is very nice, it is very clean, not like the Plaza pool which is dirty and unkept. There are some nice chairs that you can fall alseep in. Apparently all of the rooms are being redone for 2010, do not be afaid to stay here, I stayed at 4 hotels this trip, and would rate MSS as first, Binions as second, Plaza as third and the Four Queens as last on the list.</p><br>Nothing fancy, but over all great location &amp; food &amp; gaming! Wonderful Pool!!<p>OK, we got a great deal of $12 a night! We did not expect much so we were not disappointed. Beds were decent, bell service was great! if you want a downtown night or 2 this is a great place. I usually stay on the strip, but wanted to try something different this time. I am so glad I did! I love downtown! The energy is different (more real), the casinos were so much fun all over Fremont & the free shows on the "Fremont experience" streets were fantastic! The history is rich & the furnishings in some of the casinos are full of beautiful old antiques & chandeliers! There is so much to see, shopping is fun & food is great. At our hotel, they make the best grilled cheese sandwiches! It came with a yummy potato salad & a pickle. We added tomatoes to our sandwich & each meal (it was a filling ,meal) was only $4! We ate it each day it was so good! (2 days).

If you walk east on Fremont, you will find a small casino on the left. It has the only .25 roulette! It was so much fun to get $20 worth of chips & play for a long time! You must do this walk at night so you can see all the old neon lights like the “silver slipper”, the “cowboy” & many more!

The pool is a roof top pool with some of the very best views from downtown all the way to the strip & Mountains beyond! Beautiful pool deck area. Small pool, but nice.

Stay down town! You will be pleasantly surprised!</p><br>Great value for money<p>What a great hotel. Yes it needs updating. Our curtains were ripped, but the room was clean and the staff were friendly. No safe in the room but we rented a safe deposit box in the hotel lobby free of charge. We stayed for two weeks and my sister and I had the best time. The deli bar had reasonably priced snacks and on our last night we went to the Ranch Steakhouse which was very old Las Vegas, dark decor and button back leather booths. The food was excellent as was the service. I would recommend Binions to anyone who is looking for a place to lay your head at the end of a fun packed day. The advantage of staying downtown is that everything is on your doorstep. The rooftop pool was great and probably the best kept secret in Vegas. The round sun beds are great and there is very little shade so you don't need to keep moving around. It may be only a 3* hotel but we had a 5* stay.</p><br>Very Clean<p>For the price it was Great! It was very clean and the staff was so nice to us! It was in walking distance of everything. I WILL go back to stay at this Hotel. It was my first trip there and I enjoyed it so much.</p><br>In the heart of downtown<p>Our room was clean ,A/C worked great. Food from snack bar very good ...The best Ice cream cones down town. nice size room.</p><br>reasonable downtown rooms<p>Binion's has acceptable rooms located downtown. If you can snag a cheap rate, all the better!</p><br>Clean but plain rooms, great rates<p>The rooms are very small and outdated but clean. The staff was friendly. The pool is nice and the location is good for those wanting to stay in the Fremont experience area. It was an ok stay. You can't beat the price anywhere for what you get. There is no way they could redecorate with charging such low rates. We still prefer the Fremont hotel but it was not available for our dates. We would go back but only if our first choice was not available to us.</p><br>Not too bad<p>Being a local in Las Vegas, I do not usually stay at hotels here in town, but once a year for my birthday, my friends and I act like tourists (get silly, drink too much and figure a hotel room is a lot cheaper than a DUI and/or killing ourselves and others). When I stay downtown Las Vegs, I usually stay at The Golden Nugget (my favorite downtown hotel)- this year it was sold out so we had to stay at Binion's. The first thing I did was get on TripAdvisor and read the reviews-- I was kind of nervous about staying at this hotel after reading the reviews. BUT... it wasn't so bad. We did have a room in the newer tower (newer being probably decorated in the 70s). Our carpet did look pretty new though. The decor was shabby chic from the 70s. Yes, they still had an old tube TV and white laminate furniture, but.. overall, it was no where near as frightening as the prior reviews made it seem. To me, this hotel was a typical 2/3 star hotel. We did need extra towels and housekeeping brought them up within 10 minutes of our call. The overall feeling of the room was clean (just dated).
As I mentioned before The GN is my favorite downtown hotel, but... if I ever have to stay somewhere else downtown, I don't think Binion's is a bad deal-- it was fine for the price we paid and for its location. It's downtown- and besides the upgraded light show, it's still very much back in the 70s. If you want flash and high end, stay on the Strip; you want old school Vegas, you have to go downtown!</p><br></body></html>
