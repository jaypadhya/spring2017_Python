<html><head><h3>Fiesta Rancho Hotel and Casino, Las Vegas Reviews Page 6</h3></head><body><br>Great Stay<p>Received a great $27 rate during the week at this local casino and hotel. Beds were very comfortable and our room on the fith level (room 517) had a nice LCD TV. Gambling was adequate and did manage to get some play on the video poker slots.

They provide free popcorn plus their potent $.99 margaritas were great. Parking was plenty and didn't have any opportunity to try their restaurants or their buffet, but I would recommend staying at this off the strip hotel.</p><br>bad experience<p>We went to Las Vegas thinking about that was the best place to have fun and to go to Gran Canyon but the hotel was a bad experience there. We had to pay a hundred dollar deposit more, the hotel was far from downtown and far from everything. We made the reservation in Brazil and should have told about it in that time, before the reservations. At the check in the recepcionist told us about return this value, but this not happend. Unfortunatelly, I don't recommend this hotel for anyone.</p><br>Fiesta Is Still An Okay Choice<p>Stayed here last year, went again this year. I haven't changed my opinion too much, although as with any hotel, a different room and different circumstances always brings new perspectives.
Pros: Hotel staff is very friendly, got me into a room at 12:30 even though check in is 3pm. I had arrived about 10:30 am but was told there was a $15 early check in fee, so I decided to wait until after 12 to get in. I'm not sure if the early check in fee is a new feature, but I'm just including that info here for those who might run into the same situation.
Hotel is convenient to locals and those who have business in the North side of Vegas. If you want to avoid the traffic and hustle/bustle of the Strip, the Fiesta is a possible choice for you.
If you have a player's card here for gaming, you earn 3 points for every $1 you gamble.
Convenient self -parking is available as well as valet.
Food court with Denny's (had breakfast here, food was fine and service was with a smile)
and a few other fast food outlets.
Room rates a lot lower than the Strip hotels, often you can get a room during the week for $25.
Not so crowded that you feel like you're on top of other people in the casino.
Cons:
You get what you pay for. As noted, it is off the Strip, but that may be what you're looking for. My room this time was small and rather dimly lit even with all the lights on, so that was not the greatest. The a/c made an annoying sound after it had been on for awhile so sleeping was a bit interrupted and I kept having to turn off the a/c when it rattled or made sounds.
Internet: The wifi is set up on a menu through the t.v. Unfortunately, had to call the engineer to come up and look at it. Had the wrong remote to operate the t.v. which was quickly rectified, but somewhat of an annoyance. if you have trouble setting up your wifi , a wrong remote might be the problem. Once set up, the connection was fast and realiable. Internet is included with the "resort fee". The resort fee is 9.99 and it is also taxed so the actual total is around $11.00 which will be added to your room rate upon check out. Mentally you just have to add this on when booking. Many hotels charge this resort fee, not just Fiesta. I wish they would just include it up front but for now, that's the way it is.
The room had one small table, no desk or larger work surface. No big deal for me, but might be if you need to work with your laptop or other paperwork. A chair had a rather bad stain on it, which really should have been removed for cleaning or taken out of service altogether. The room seemed clean enough and the beds were acceptable, although the carpeting in some areas and the hallways looked soiled and really needs replacement or a good cleaning. Bathroom was small but clean. Minimal toiletries - two soap and two shampoo. Plumbing sounds - I could hear the filling of the bath tub in an adjoining room as if it was in my own room, loud enough that it woke me up around midnite. So, some rooms may not have great soundproofing. Finally, at 4am the alarm clock in the room went off, probably had been set from a prior guest to turn on at that time. Not the greatest to be awoken 3-4 hours earlier than planned by a buzzing alarm. Maybe housekeeping should check the alarms and make sure they are in the OFF position. The room had a nice flat screen t.v. which worked well, no problems.
The downsides weren't huge, more annoyances than anything else. Therefore, I would stay here again, although probably wouldn't stay for more than 1-2 nights at most. . The slots here seem somewhat tight, have never won anything, but ya never know! Again, this is more of a locals place. The hotel needs updating but you don't pay top dollar for a room and it's acceptable enough for that purpose. I would not recommend paying more than $50 at any time for a room here. If all you can find at thie place is $80+ , skip it and go somewhere else where there's better rooms and more to do, , you'll probably feel disappointed if you pay more. but if you want a casino atmosphere with a basic okay type of room and you have a need or reason to be in this part of town, Fiesta remains an acceptable choice depending on what you want. Staff has always been very friendly and seem helpful. I have not tried the buffet or their other dining options such as Gardunos or the onsite bars, so at this time cannot rate those.</p><br>Deceptive room rates and poor food quality.<p>When looking for a room in Henderson, we came upon the Fiesta Hotel and Casino. The rates posted on the Internet were very reasonable, so we stopped there to stay overnight. When we checked in, we found that the room rates were not as posted due to a "hotel facility fee charge". We feel that was deceptive, and would have looked elsewhere for a room if we had known.
My wife came down with food poisoning after eating at the buffet breakfast. We feel that the food quality at the buffet, while looking presentable, is suspect. Eat there at your own risk!</p><br>Not-So-Sinful City<p>This is not the place to pretend you're in the Rat Pack. But it's a great location for real families with rambunctious children. The parking is very close to the hotel door, a rarity in Vegas. The pool is closed much of the year, and it's tiny compared to the mega-resorts' pools on and near the Strip. But tiny is good for parents or grandparents trying to keep track of multiple kids with dubious swimming skills. The Fiesta's directly across the street from the only drive-in movie theater in southern Nevada. It's next door to a world class bowling facility (Texas Station) where the dining options are much better than the Fiesta's. Next door, but still quite a hike. Drive it. One of Vegas's only ice skating rinks is across the casino from the hotel. You can get the kids started on the ice & sneak out periodically to help Clark County pave the potholes and keep the street lights on. The buffet is inferior, but the Mexican restaurant, Garduno's is quite good and serves a margarita in which you could - in a pinch - bob for apples. Like all Denny's, the one in Fiesta is slow, friendly and overpriced. The hotel itself is a bargain, but not as much of a bargain as it pretends to be: they spring extra (county-mandated) charges on you at check-in. The staff is friendly, and the rooms are clean and quiet. A Wal-Mart and Radio Shack are walking distance for the robust, a short drive for the rest of us. If your kids go through a lot of soda, buy drinks and ice at Wal-Mart & bring them to your room in an ice chest. Traffic's not bad here. Maybe two miles up Rancho Drive is a roller skating rink that your kids will enjoy. They have a website that lists their themed nights and specials. In winter, you're on the side of town closest to Las Vegas Ski & Snowboard Resort, an easy 45-minute drive into the mountains. I am a grandparent & I really had a blast this year while my wife was locked in grim hand-to-hand combat with the One-Armed Bandit in the neon dungeon.
Room Tip: Sunsets over Spring Mountains on west side. Pool and your car visible from east-facing rooms.

We parked at the spacious parking garage and took the elevator to the casino floor which led to the buffet area. They offer quite a variety of fresh cooked food. No need to stuff yourself, just pick what you like and the whole deal is a fraction of the cost that you would spend for a restaurant meal. Make sure that you signed up for the Boarding Pass, their loyalty card which gives you a $ 5.00 discount per person. At $ 5.99 for lunch and 7.99 for dinner this is a steal.</p><br>Great place to stay and gamble<p>Clean unpretensious rooms with convienent parking, reasonable priced restaurants, and gaming just downstairs! Fiesta is considered a "locals" casino but for a good time at a very reasonable cost its a good place to stay for out of towners. Big flat screen TV.
Room Tip: Jalf of rooms face east for morning sunrise, opposite half face town and mountains.

Spent three days here, and found it more than adequate. Staff is friendly, the room was clean, bed was comfy, nice flat screen t.v., and everything in the room was functional. The room wasn't huge but just fine. I've read some not so great reviews about this hotel but my experience was positive. Had a 5th floor room with a beautiful view of the mountains.I was there during the week, very quiet, non-smoking. (didn't smell any smoke in hallways or room). Only thing I wasn't overly happy with was the bathroom - it was small, and the vanity portion had very little counter space, so if you have a need for space or you're trying to get ready for a big night out and need an area to spread out, you might not like that. It just depends on what you are looking for. However, the bathroom was clean so no complaints there. Check in was easy with no mixups or complications. The hotel has several restaurants - Denny's, Panda Express, etc. This hotel is more of a locals type of place but it's good to keep Fiesta in mind if it suits your travel and budget needs. I would stay here again. Parking is easy, either self park or parking garage. The surrounding neighborhood isn't the most upscale, no. But it's like any other area, use common sense and you'll be fine.
Room Tip: go for the top floors, esp. the 5th...nice panoramic views, no one above you, quiet.

Free parking-it was cheap and minimal-old but fir our needs-would I stay here for several days? No.
Room Tip: Good for a stop-over
See more room tips</p><br>Not that bad and the buffet and service are great.<p>So, I received lodging at the Rancho as part of a Travelocity package. Essentially the room and car were free when bundled with a plane ticket purchased last minute. I read the (bad) Trip Advisor reviews, so I prepared myself for the worst, but it really wasn't that bad. The check-in desk was tucked behind the sports book, but I found it quickly. It was a late check-in, so there was a sign on the desk that directed me to call security for assistance. In about 10 minutes a very nice woman pleasantly appeared, and gave me a room key. The hotel was secure, the parking lots were well lit, and while the surrounding area was a bit "shady," by using my head I felt like I was safe during my stay.

The room wasn't anything special, but the beds were clean and fresh daily, the bathroom was well equipped (with great water pressure) and the maids were very nice.

The buffet was inexpensive and offered an incredible variety. The mussels on the Italian bar were very good, and the Mongolian BBQ was excellent. And it was cheap.

The hotel attracts the locals. You don't see the BPs here that you would on the strip, but they are friendly and definitely here for fun.

So, while I wouldn't run out and encourage you to pick the Rancho over other properties in Vegas, if you said you were going there I wouldn't try to talk you out of it. It's a bargain, and if you're willing to drive, like I was, it's a decent place to base your Vegas cheapo-trip.</p><br></body></html>
