<html><head><h3>Fiesta Rancho Hotel and Casino, Las Vegas Reviews Page 7</h3></head><body><br>A hotel to stay at for a family funeral<p>The people who ran the front dest, security, house-keeping and even in the Denny's at this place were extremely nice!!!! They were also very accomadating when we needed 2 rooms close to eachother. We were relocated to the 5th floor where they had just gotten all new mattresses and plasma screen tv's. The beds were good and the tv was was well, except when ever you turned it on it came on full blast. We thought maybe it was just our TV, but my mother's tv did the same. I do not suggest the buffett as it is not the greatest. It was not horrible, but not great either. There are tons of places to eat in local shopping centers from chain resturants to nice mom and pop places to eat too!

For us, the hotel served the purpose of a place to sleep as we spent most of our time with our family as my mother's brother had passed away. No one at the hotel knew this yet they treated us so kindly as if they did know.</p><br>Horrible Experience<p>I had to stay here for 1 night. I've never been here before. I got in late and parked near the valet to run in quick to check in (which I though was parking for registration). I check in and come back out to the car 10 minutes later. Two valet attendants who were around 16-18 years old start yelling obscene words at me "f-this" and "f-that". They said I was in a fire zone (even though there were no signs). This went on for 5 mintues. I told them to buzz off and the one guy got right in my face. I pushed him away, got in the car, and drove to the parking lot. As I drove away the two kids yelled "f-you" at me. I couldn't believe two employees acted this way and went in to talk to the manger. To make a long story short, he fired both of them on the spot. They also charge you a $12/day fee ontop of the room charge for the telephone in your room and a newspaper, even if you don't use it. They don't tell you about this until you check in. I disputed the charge with my cc bank.</p><br>Ok, we have searched high and low for the...<p>Ok, we have searched high and low for the most quality buffet at the best price in Vegas....It's kind of a fun little hobby for my wife and me. If anyone can top the Fiesta Resort's lunch buffet at$ 5.99 a person, that person would either be lying or on drugs. A.MAZING quality!!! Amazing ambience!!! Everything about this buffet, from taste to service, smokes the Rio!!!
You had better get yourself over there before one of their corporate hacks starts to examine the food costs and makes some sort of crazy adjustment.</p><br>Bad Bad and in one word BAD<p>I think it is funny that when you look at the back of the player card for the Station Casinos they do not list the Fiesta Rancho. The reason not to list this hotel is because it is the ugly step child no one wants to talk about. This hotel has no breakfast buffet but makes you eat at the Denny's which is located inside that is understaffed and extremely slow. The hotel is old and run down. I was asked every day of a 5 night stay if I was checking out by the housekeeper. My double bed room which was holding four of us went from 4 towels day one to one clean towel by day 4, even though they have signs all over that say if you leave a dirty one on the floor they will replace it and anything you leave hanging they will leave there but it was my choice, guess not because housekeeping decided the four of us only needed one towel. The room key was deactivated three times during our stay. The room was so smoke filled I checked my hand to make sure I was not smoking because I was going crazy. Be warned that a non smoking floor is more like a smoking floor just not smoke directly from you. I am sad that this hotel is part of the Station Casinos chain, I am sad I stayed here but I had no choice because of a family death and a need for a quick room. This hotel needs to be imploded and buried with the rest of the bodies in the desert. PLEASE DON'T STAY I understand the price is cheap but it is not worth the hassle you want cheap stay at a holiday inn or la quinta.</p><br>say real price up front!!<p>when reserving a room you think you have paid for, but get there and there are all these fees and deposits you don't know about just isn't right. and to boot, the 12.00 a day we paid for internet, phone and newpaper, the internet nor phone worked!! kind of an expensive newspaper i think, especially when you are on vacation and don't have time to read it. Very disappointed in customer service, no one even cared that nothing worked they were determined to get their fees!!! will never stay again and know a lot of people that go to Vegas that will never stay.</p><br>Nice Hotel<p>The Hotel is a nice hotel for the casino player. The rooms are good however We had a problem with unattended children in the next room at 0130am. when reported to the night manager she wasnt interested.</p><br>This place is a dump<p>We went to Alliante which looked very nice. They were sold out, and the reservations department recommended Fiesta. Some guy who says "God Bless You" a lot named "Miner" told us the Fiesta was the nicest of all the Station Hotels. This was a big fat lie, and it was really late at night so we were tired and ready to sleep. The lady at the desk was rude and told us the water would be off for four hours. Between the bums and shady people hanging out it felt like we were in the GHETTO. The room was gross, tiny, and dirty. Not a nice place to stay at all. People say you get what you pay for, but if you go over to The Orleans the price is the same and very nice and not creepy and dirty at all. AVOID THIS PLACE LIKE THE PLAGUE unless you like the GHETTO.</p><br>Low Price, but you Get What you Pay For<p>Fiesta Rancho is a hotel/casino in North Las Vegas, which is a fair distance away from the Strip. As a result, the room rates here are considerably lower than what you will find elsewhere in Vegas. Unfortunately, you pretty much get what you pay for with this place.

The casino is in a rather low-rent section of the city, and the casino's parking structure is not even remotely close to the hotel. So you'll have to park your car outside in a rather iffy area, although they do have bicycle security that monitors the lots constantly.

Rooms are fair at best. My heater didn't work, and I had to call somebody to repair it. The bathroom smelled moldy and unpleasant.

Front desk was not very professional. Hung up on me after placing me on hold for over five minutes. Forgot to tell me basic information I needed before checking into the room. The lady who currently works at the desk has real problems speaking coherent English -- she just mumbles into the phone.

Unlike other casinos, there is no breakfast buffet here, so you'll have to eat at the 24-hr Denny's if you're looking to eat before 11:00 or so. The casino itself is small and dingy compared to other local casinos. This place is an older casino, and pretty much looks it.

My advice is to go the newer Texas Station casino across the street, which is ten times better than this place, and costs roughly about the same.</p><br>filthy, filthy, filthy!!!!!<p>I should of taken the advice of past travelers... the hotel was old, smelly, dingy and depressing. We had a bad experience, for starters the shower floor was dirty with feet prints, the towels had rust stains, the sheets had dirt marks and their was a dead bug in our room.... stay away....</p><br>they charge a seperate service fee for no service at all<p>they charge a seperate service fee for no service at all
