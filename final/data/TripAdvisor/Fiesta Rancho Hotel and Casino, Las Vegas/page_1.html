<html><head><h3>Fiesta Rancho Hotel and Casino, Las Vegas Reviews Page 1</h3></head><body><br>Not bad!!<p>Our first night staying here was rather rough and then was not expecting the resort fee and no amenities at time of check in not even food we were ready to leave but we decided to stay and give the chance. The staff was very nice all restaurants were operating the next day. They had a great buffet for the price the rooms were quiet the rooms were clean. Noi is the best housekeeper ever. So make sure you tip her a few bucks she works really hard. She goes outta her way to make your stay comfortable. It's no Bellagio but for the price I will take it. After all your there to sleep your not moving in. I rated this a four star based on price and staff.</p><br>Excellent<p>Thank you fiesta rancho I love your rooms very comfortable and clean. I do not remember the persons name that cleaned room but always had it smelling good.
She's in the first floor (: Thank you I will keep doing reservations with fiesta plus the price is always reasonable and affordable.</p><br>DUMP and TIGHT MACHINES<p>This casino is NOT in a good area. Fiesta has a lot of low class low education people playing in it. LOUD yelling people and video machines to pay VERY LITTLE!! The Subway sandwich place is convenient and nice employees. I find the management snooty and have a 'don't care' attitude.
Room Tip: Do N O T stay here....in a tough neighborhood and lots of low class people inside.

I took one look on line and knew I did not want to stay here and booked another room as a backup, just in case. We arrived fairly late because our flight (another issue) was 2.5 hours late. The hotel smelled and reeked of stale cigarettes and cheap paint. The updated room was actually updated, but when you are starting from a 1 star to begin with, it's hard to reach 3 or 4 stars without vision. We could not bear staying here. The staff was nice, but the hotel wasn't. Nonetheless, as a good gesture we paid for one nights resort fees. If you are used to 3+ star hotels, I would not recommend this hotel.</p><br>Cheap, away from the strip<p>The price of the property is cheap and so are the rooms. Don't be surprised by burnt (yes, burnt) or broken side tables of bed. Standard is lower than average standard of Vegas hotels. Check in was not very comfortable and we had to wait till we got the room. We almost slept waiting. Only go if you want to stay away from the strip and save some bucks.</p><br>The price is right,but like the saying goes you get what you pay for.<p>The casino it self is ok.The rooms are old and they look it,I would say like back in the 50's.It is pet friendly ,and there is a lot of people there who brought their dogs.The food court and diner is very nice,the buffet is awesome with great food.Thier staff needs alittle help on their service.The casino also has a large movie theater,and that is very nice and clean.
Room Tip: This is a pet friendly hotel.But the rooms are very old and not modern at all.The casino it self is...

The Casino is pretty good and in a much better state than the hotel, which looks like it has not been looked after for years; very old with lots of issues (hot water, mold, bad smell, big stains on carpets, etc...).
The service is a hit or miss, just depending on who is working; I found the morning staff quite uninterested while the evening staff was quite nice.
I did enjoy the view of the mountain from my room.</p><br>Better than expected!<p>I booked this hotel strictly for it being close to North Vegas airport where I flew in for one night before I went to the Grand Canyon. I needed somewhere cheap to stay and the Fiesta delivered on both accounts. Having read the poor reviews I expected something awful and was pleasantly surprised! My room did what it was suppose to and was very clean. The bed was comfortable and the "free" (you have to pay the 11 dollar resort fee after all) WiFi was ok speed wise for general use.

The casino part was actually pretty charming. I have been to the more glitzy parts of Vegas and the Fiesta Rancho isn't that part. Buy I actually preferred the more relaxed approach to gambling with friendly staff that seemed to cater to a much more local group of clients. The buff√©t was also good and at roughly ten bucks a steal given what you get.

All in all - if you are looking for the strip experience - this is NOT it. But if you are in town overnight, need a cheap place to stay while also doing a little bit of carefree gambling then The Fiesta Rancho actually is pretty good.</p><br>A Contradiction Of Itself: Good and Bad all rolled into one<p>Off-The-Strip hotel/casino. Big place, big parking lot, AWESOME BUFFETT, Clean Lobby. Oddly, the giant front entrance, with all its lights and carport, friendly staff, and vegas-style roll-up, is NOT where you check in. The actual check-in is around the back. Past the pool. Next to the maintenance shack. Around the dumpster. Really?

The elevator heading up to our room was shockingly small. The hallway to the room was clean and wide. The room itself was....uh.....Super8-ish. Clean, not worn out in any way, but....NOT Vegas. Small, boring. El-Cheapo plastic shower/tub. Toilet very comfortable....if you happen to be under 4 feet tall (seriously-where did they find the Hobbit Potty?). I didnt care for the shower and toilet being in the tiny 'bathroom' and the sink being in the room with us (again-NOT Vegas).

Not to mention my New Official Las Vegas Pet Peeve: NO FRIDGE OR MICROWAVE IN THE ROOM! ARGH! (do I need to get my mother involved?)

Not a bad place to stay on a road trip, but not what you would expect based on all the flash pulling into the parking lot.</p><br>Part of the family-owned Stations Casinos. Very good locals hotel rate for self or visitors<p>Nice large clean rooms usually come with great coupon book! Quiet & Safe. A secret for locals. Also has pool outdoors, movie theatre, ice skating, nice casino. Be sure to get your Stations card good at all the Stations Casino Hotels in Vegas. Very good low priced ($5.99-6.99) buffet with lots of choices in Chinese - Italian - American - huge salad/soup bar, desserts! Great spot for meetings or reunions or family parties. Very good service. Also has a pretty good Denny's. Bus to downtown right outside & only a couple stops.
Room Tip: Back side where no sun wakes you up!
