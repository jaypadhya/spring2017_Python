<html><head><h3>Fiesta Rancho Hotel and Casino, Las Vegas Reviews Page 5</h3></head><body><br>Fantastic value for money<p>Visited This hotel for a 2 night stay in October with some friends. Amazing value @ $49 per night room rate and whilst the rooms were a little jaded they were very clean. The casino was extremely well maintained and very clean and breakfast was reasonably priced with good choice. Pleasantly surprised and would have no issue staying again.</p><br>Do not stay here<p>I live in Vegas, and have not been to the Fiesta in several years. I was there in December to meet some friends of friends who were in town. We went up to their room to get them, as soon as I entered the room, I felt like I needed a shower and I made certain not to touch anything...would not stay here ever, even if it were free. A few minutes North is Santa Fe Station, stay there.
Room Tip: There is not a good room here. Check out Santa Fe Station instead, much better property

It was quiet, the room was large, we were in the newer section on the floor (the other part was a bit creepy), there was no coffee pot (at par for Las Vegas), no wifi, no fridge and no free breakfast, but you could get pancakes very cheap until 6 a.m. in the casino's coffe shop. There is a Subway and other places to eat in the casino which was very quiet and relaxing and smoke-free the next morning. This hotel is outside Las Vegas, maybe 20 minutes from the airport, but a good stop if you are heading towards Kingman or further in Arizona.</p><br>Don't go whatever the price<p>Went here cuz I had one night layover in Las Vegas, got it for 20 dollars and still wouldn't go if I knew. The rooms are just dirty, the bathroom hasn't been cleaned, I know because there were still soap bars from other stays!!
The walls are so thin I think paper is more sound proof than it, and the hotel's elevator is one of the most annoying, beeping each floor it passes makes you wish you were on the first floor</p><br>Stay away!<p>Awful hotel. The low prices are deceptive- they charge you for EVERYTHING else. 100 dollar deposit required, 11 dollar hotel fee, 5.99 internet... it's not cheap at all! The hotel is dusty and smoke filled, and old. There's nothing nice about this location. It's also way off strip, and in a rough area of town. Don't stay here.</p><br>Great location off the strip for family spring break<p>We stayed in some units on the ground floor that had a full kitchen, family room with a nice TV, and really nice bathroom vanity. The staff were very nice and let us use their internet in the lobby. Small work-out room with a TV. We also took advantage of the free shuttle to go to Fremont Street. This was a fun place to stay with our high school daughter. We were able to do a ton of shopping from here and saved some money by eating breakfast in the place and lunch if we were at the pool, etc.</p><br>worse customer service<p>the rooms are filthy and nasty, we ate at gardunos restaurant. the service was lousy and we were overcharged. the food was fresh but tasteless. don't waste your time. we spend money gambling and get one drink in 3hrs and the cocktail waitress was rude and did not deserve the tip I gave her. this is las vegas with multiple casino's so I will NEVER return to this establishment</p><br>Deceptive...Average at Best!<p>Nightly rate of $26.00 is deceptive.They than add $11.00 per night for such things as Wi-Fi,daily newspaper delivery etc,as well as hotel tax.Hotel is old and has a very musty smell through out.Made a few requests at point of reservation and none had been addressed.Had to request all over again upon arrival and than wait for a fair amount of time after having traveled all day.There were no bath towels in the bathroom upon arrival.The Fiesta Buffet was below average.Buffets at their other facilities are far far superior.If you which to stay in that part of town and seek a very reasonable rate I would suggest Texas Station not the Fiesta.They are right next to each other.A few miles down the road is Santa Fe Station which would also be a better choice.Overall in my opinion I would eliminate the Fiesta.</p><br>Upgrade from Motel 6 if that's your usual motel<p>Don't be fooled by their low price come-ons. First they take a $100 deposit. Then they add a gambling tax. So our $35 room ended up at $75. Our room was reasonably clean, carpet was ripped & walls scarred by furniture. Old tube style TV. If your normal motel is Motel 6 you'll be pleased. Otherwise stay away.

Hotel in rundown part of town. We felt there was a security issue in the parking lot because it backed to a major through street with no fence.
Room Tip: Choose some other hotel.

I know you get what you pay for and we did choose the hotel for convenience to our family... So, that being said we are staying at the Texas Station next time.. Just as convenient but, nicer. It is worth the extra $30 it would have cost us to get the amenities that you are paying for with the "resort" fee. I use the world loosely.

We visit Vegas 2 times a year and usually always stay at one of the Stations.. Red Rock rocks the Texas is nice and this will be our last time at Fiesta. We are platinum station card holders... And to say the least very disappointed. In a positive note better than a Motel 6 and the employees are friendly and helpful..</p><br></body></html>
