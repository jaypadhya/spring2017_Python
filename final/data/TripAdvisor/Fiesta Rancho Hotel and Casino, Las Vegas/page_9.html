<html><head><h3>Fiesta Rancho Hotel and Casino, Las Vegas Reviews Page 9</h3></head><body><br>For polite service go elsewhere<p>My family and I stayed at this local hotel because we have family nearby. We were surprised by rude and inattentive staff who acted as if they could care less whether we were there or not. The hall and elevator carpets are worn and stained and badly in need of a vacuuming. The elevator doors were old and heavy and shut hard on my husband's back when he entered w/his suitcare. The room was unimpressive and small. We called a posted number to complain about two staff members who were particularly rude and abrupt when we asked questions and were told we would be contacted by management but this never happened. You will likely get much better SERVICE elsewhere in Vegas. For a town committed to tourism and service this place was a nightmare. Spend a little more and stay on the strip where your business is valued and appreciated. Avoid this place! DH - Wichita, KS</p><br>large casino, good pit boss, comps<p>came to play in a Ice Hockey tourneyment.
The place is nice and spacious. The Craps Pit Boss (Bill) was great, and as soon as I tipped the waitress a Red Chip ($5) she came every 5 minutes!
The dealers were slow, but ok. The buffet comp is easy to score, and has avg food. The 10x odds on craps was nice.
If you are looking to stay somewhere away from all the action, this is a good value. Large Texas station casino next door has more resturants.
Just ask pit boss for some food there....</p><br>It's okay if you don't mind not staying on the Strip<p>The Fiesta seems to have some cool things about it like an ice skating rink, karaoke performances, and what looks to be a good Mexican restaurant along with a buffet. Plus, it's next to the Texas Station, which has a movie theater, arcade, and even more restaurants. Our room was comfortable, but the selection of TV channels was quite limited. Also, the outdoor pool is small and quite undeveloped, and it seems like hotel guests don't get any special perks for staying at the Fiesta. That was disappointing. Perhaps most troubling of all though is the distance between the Fiesta and the Las Vegas Strip; it's like 10 miles or so. Besides this establishment and the Texas Station, there isn't too much to do in the immediate area. If you want to be close to the action of the Strip, then I don't recommend this place; otherwise, it is an okay deal for the price, I think.</p><br>Não vale qualquer economia <p>Comprei um pacote na internet onde dizia que ficaríamos em determinado hotel na strip, ou similar. Mas acabamos sendo colocados no Fiesta, que de similar não tinha nada. Muito distante da strip, gastamos muito com taxi porque n conseguimos pegar nenhum ônibus, pq so passavam a cada duas horas. Os próprios taxistas nos disseram para mudar de hotel pq o local era muito perigoso. Não tinha café da manhã incluso e ainda tivemos problema com nossas malas, porque informaram no próprio hotel que tinham maleiro e quando fomos deixá-las fomos informados que não tinham e precisamos pagar mais uma diária para nossa mala ficar guardada. Foi uma péssima experiência.</p><br>Bastante pasable...<p>Fui en septiembre del 2014 en vije desde Gerlach, parando un par de noches en este hotel porque queda cerca de la casa de mi amigo Jerry (donde ya había un par de amigos).- El hotel es bastane bueno (tíico hotel de las afueras de Las Vegas, sin estilo de nada), limpio, todo funciona bien, por la zona en la que está no prometía nada pero al final resultó ser bastane bueno; está LLENO de chinos. Parece que estás en Asia!!!</p><br>Bom custo benefício.<p>Optei por uma noite nesse hotel pela economia, paguei R$55,00 no Brasil. E uma taxa de 11 dólares no ato de check-in que ainda assim compensou. Não fica localizado na strip. Mas como dito, era apenas para uma última noite antes de partirmos de Vegas. Ótima área de casino, bem ampla e com margueritas a 99cents.
Um ponto negativo é a localização, caso não esteja de carro gastará bastante com táxi. Mas há linhas de ônibus que passam bem na frente. Não há frigobar no quarto.
Room Tip: Os quartos mais superiores possuem menor ruído e ar condicionado satisfatório

chambre très propre et fonctionnelle malgré la petite taille des lits.
quartier nord de Las Vegas loin du strip et pas très "glamour".</p><br></body></html>
