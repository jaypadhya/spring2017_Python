The hotel is sparkling clean and most important of all ... the bed was great! Every person on the staff I encountered was warm, welcoming and willing to assist with whatever I needed. I would highly recommend this hotel for those that want to getaway from the noise and smell of smoke.</p><br>A Home away from Home<p>The most important feature of this hotel is the people. Kathy and Carol from the dining room were so warm and kind, always so willing to help me fill up my hot water flask each morning and remembering what i'd like to drink, Front Desk personnel were always smiling and helpful, greeting you each time they see you. Housekeepers did a wonderful job of keeping my room immaculate each day.
Though it's off The Strip but it was quiet and away from the hustle and bustle but yet near enough to get to anywhere. They have regular shuttles that take you to part of The Strip, Town Square (a quaint shopping area with a wide variety of F&B outlets). They also do free shuttles from the hotel to the airport.
I would highly recommend anyone to stay here if you are looking for an affordable room to stay in that is clean and safe and great team of staff to make you feel at home.</p><br>nice rooms off the strip with good connection to both strip and downtown<p>We had 2 nights in this hotel (3 people sharing this room, worked perfect!)
The hotel is a bit off the strip, but by the monorail with connection to all the strip hotels is just across the street.
Check-in and -out were quite fast, service was friendly, and free parking just in front of the door.
The room offers everything we needed, including a small balcony with view to the pool.
The pool is not very big (but also not like a big bathtub - it was ok for swimming) and opened until 11pm! :)
The bar in the lobby is nice, service also here ok.
We had a good time, and I would come again for sure.</p><br>Weekend Spend close to Las Vegas strip<p>Rooms are OK, but furniture in them has seen better days. I had a room with view of a pool. It can be very noisy in the rooms which I think is due to the fact that the walls are very thin. Basically you can hear any louder talk from rooms nearby. Service in the hotel especially at reception is very poor and unprofessional. It was like in the kinder garden when person tells you that they call you when shuttle is there, but then they don't, you should wait somewhere and then is somewhere else etc.
Most information provided at reception during my stay was inaccurate and I would advice anyone who stumbles across this hotel to be aware of it and rather relies on good old google. Personally I think twice whether to come to this hotel again.
Room Tip: Further away from outdoor swimming pool might be quiter

Only downside is it is right next to airport so some airplane noise. Good for family travel if you don't want you kids in a casino hotel.</p><br>If you want to enjoy pool time don't stay here<p>When we got there we could not check it because the rooms were not ready, even though we asked for an early check in when made the reservations.
This hotel has good beds and is quite because is outside the Strip; however, you might want to ask if they are receiving any little league baseball teams on the same weekend you are staying before doing your reservation.
Don't get me wrong, I have nothing against LLB, my own kid plays it! I do have a problem with the adults "in charge" of them.
I went to the pool with three kids thinking we could have a nice time and found a large group of boys playing "polo", throwing the ball all around the pool area with complete disregard of anyone else there. A family with two little toddlers girls had to leave the pool because they didn't feel safe, another two women got there and after 10 min decided to leave. The pool is nice and you would want to enjoy the time there, but when you have a group that makes the pool their own private pool is not fun.
I spoke to someone at the front desk, she went and spoke to the couple "in charge"...it was until then I realized someone was actually in charge of that group, because during this whole time the kids were jumping, getting on top the stair rails and jumping, on top of the decorative rock fountain, running and screaming all around throwing the ball, they didn't say a word to them, they were just sitting down, looking at their phones. Shame on them! what a bad example to those kids.
Anyway, after the lady at the front desk spoke to them, the kids got a little better, not to much, kept playing with the ball and even hit my head really hard with it while playing. I understand this was an accident and they didn't mean to, but the adults instead of doing something about it they laughed and said it was just an accident and were completely rude about it. I went and asked to speak to the manager at the hotel, the two staff members there were nice and said they would talk to them again. I don't know what happen after that because I went up to my room with my kids. I do know they didn't do their job well, that group should have been asked to leave the pool. They even told me they had more guest who tried to enjoy complaining about them.
If you want to have a relaxing time and enjoy the pool after being on the Strip then don't stay here, or at least ask before if they are receiving a large group of kids, maybe other little league with a professional, educated, well manner coach could have been different. The hotel should report that coach and that woman who was with him with the LLB, because they were completely unprofessional. I wouldn't want my kid having a coach like that.</p><br>Nice hotel for early flight<p>We stayed at this location for one night as we were leaving Las Vegas. Location is close to the airport and easy access for rental car return. While it's not one of your super casino resorts, its a very nice property. Consistent with the Courtyard brand. Check in was very good, professional staff that was very helpful. Room was typical Courtyard with comfortable bed and nice bathroom. Nice location.</p><br>Nice hotel off of the strip!<p>We were traveling, and just wanted a place to relax and rest versus dealing with the traffic and nightlife on the strip. Rooms here were recently updated, clean and quiet. Hotel staff was super efficient and friendly. As I recall, a light breakfast was included. I'd totally recommend this hotel! We had a great experience, and would stay there again!</p><br></body></html>
