See more room tips</p><br>Amazing with value<p>I came on Memorial weekend the worst time to travel to see Cher at MGM and I am glad I found this amazing hotel. All the hotels on the strip were more than $300 and luckily I found this nice Courtyard for only $105 a night. The front desk staff was super fun and helpful with a great sense of humor! The breakfast was only $10 and it was made to order whatever you wanted the amazing cooks would make it with a smile. I felt right at home here! Please make sure you tip the good service they were very grateful. The rooms were spotless and beds were comfy! I would stay here again in a New York minute. The shuttle runs every hour and takes you to New york New york for free but I still love to tip the helpful staff! This hotel has 110% Customer service!!!!
Room Tip: Pool view was awesome!!!!!
See more room tips</p><br>Good hotel, close to airport, excellent for long stay<p>We found the Courtyard to be very accommodating for our 8 day stay. The hotel is near the airport, which is very helpful with late arrival and early departure flights. We choose this hotel over any of the others near there for several reasons: it has King beds, small refrigerator and microwave, restaurant open for breakfast and dinner, some drinks and snacks available at all times. Staff was very helpful and friendly. Internet was a bit of a problem getting connected initially but worked fine after that. Front desk was not knowledgeable about how to get the browser to find the acceptance site, but we got it working on our own. Due to many early appointments we did not eat during breakfast but used the restaurant for dinner several times and found the food to be good and ample portions, pricing was also very good.
Only problems were in the housekeeping areas: no paper or pens to write with for several days and not replaced again when used, towels taken and not replaced so didn't have enough of each type, also temperature controls were never able to be set properly and stay where we wanted them to be. Bed underpad wanted to slide around and would easily get bunched up and not comfortable; perhaps this Marriott could use some different linens as everything didn't fit as well and comfortably as we've found at other Marriotts.
One caution would be this hotel is near the flight path of the airport and at times plane noise might be an issue. Most times, we did not have a problem with thinness of walls, there was adequate hot water for showers and availability of parking spaces. Definitely would stay here again.</p><br>Bit away from Strip, but good!<p>Nice property by Marriot, but bit away from Strip. Staff are friendly and helpful. We stayed there only gor two nights and were bit in hurry so not enjoyed all the facilities. Net connectivity was fairly good and they have some systems in lobby to browse free. Overall ambience of the hotel is very good.</p><br>A Solid Meal at the Bistro Restaurant at the Courtyard.<p>We have three Marriott Properties in the same area. The Fairfield Inn & Suites; The Spring Hill Suites and the Courtyard all by Marriott.

Being the first two The Fairfield Inn & Suites and The Spring Hill Suites do not have any full service restaurants this makes the Courtyard a great place to both stay and eat!!

Unlike the other new Courtyard Bistro Restaurants this one is surprisingly large as you can sit in a large dining area or at the bar. The menu is also different than the new concept Courtyard Bistro's...

So it is very nice to have a great restaurant within walking distances of these three Marriott Properties and the food is great and priced right!</p><br>OK for business and if you want to be off the strip<p>The Courtyard was quiet and what you would expect from Marriott. It is off the strip and reasonably priced. If you have a car it is good place to stay. But if you want to visit the strip and don't have a car it isn't convenient.

The staff was very nice and very helpful.</p><br>Excellent Choice to Relax off Strip<p>This really is a great choice for a relaxing place to stay away from the activity of the strip but has easy access via free shuttle from the hotel to Mandalay Bay (5 minutes away) or New York New York. I have stayed at this property many times over the years. The rooms are nice and clean & dependable as Courtyard has proven to be during my stays around the country. We had a balcony overlooking the pool which was great. Only complaint may be having a lot of noise in the room above us from some heavy footed guests early in the morning. The pool was quiet & accessible during the day and relaxed. Staff were great! Thank you Dillon! Loved the hike up Mt Charleston to the Falls. They had excellent suggestions for places to visit & restaurant choices. Just south of this property is the Town Square shopping center with fabulous restaurants & shops without the craziness of the strip. We loved Bonefish & The Yardhouse & The Claim Jumper. Whole foods was a great quick breakfast option for coffee & scones & we used the Tix4tonight booth there for a great deal on show tickets. Enjoy!</p><br>Good Stay off "the strip"<p>We had a good time here. The rooms were a bit small to what we are used to and for the price. Other than that customer service is awesome. Kyle and Johanna were the best and well versed in the hotel and the surround areas. We stayed for two nights and enjoyed the pool, Cafe area downstairs and the Breakfast omelette. The pool and Jacuzzi were great. The shuttle to and from "the strip" that was complimentary was a nice touch. i wish I had asked for a larger room. As the one we had was a little claustrophobic for me and my wife. Many others complained about the airplanes but we really didn't notice them. Not sure if that's because we live in Los Angeles Metro area.
Room Tip: Ask for an upgrade to a larger room if possible.

Comfortable, with enough space for two people to spread out and repack suit cases. Enjoyed having a fridge and microwave. Lovely breakfast is included in this price as was the shuttle to and from the Strip.
Room Tip: The hotel itself is quiet, the road outside is not. The Strip is not far and neither is the airport...

My only complaint was, walls were a little thin, and other guest woke me up around 7am. There was enough parking, front desk was helpful, pool area looked nice, but it was too cold to swim.</p><br></body></html>
