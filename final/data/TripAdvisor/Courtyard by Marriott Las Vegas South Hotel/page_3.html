<html><head><h3>Courtyard by Marriott Las Vegas South Hotel Reviews Page 3</h3></head><body><br>Pretty Nice Stay<p>Staff is very nice. Only complaint is that the walls and windows let in a lot of sound. Could hear the TV next door and every jet taking off at the airport. But a nice place to stay. Breakfast and bar areas are excellent. Pool area is somewhat small but looks nice.</p><br>Nice hotel<p>Very nice hotel not on the strip. Good for families and the lobby was very beautiful and welcoming. The hotel room was also very nice. The pool was pretty good as well, but for a Marriott I was expecting it to be bigger. However the hot tub was not a hot tub, nor was it even warm. The water was the same temperature of the pool. Other then that though, I was very pleased with this hotel.</p><br>I recommend this hotel on weekend visits to Las Vegas<p>Nice rooms-comfortable beds and pillows-good breakfast buffet bar-and nice employees. They have much lower weekend rates compared to other well known name hotels in Vegas. Enjoyed my stay and would definitely return.</p><br>Make sure you are on the right side of the building!<p>When checking in - I told them I got zero sleep last night and could they put me in a quiet room - we checked in early, no conferences in town or other reason every room was booked, and they put me beside a room level with the highway. Room was great, food in the lobby was great but if I can't sleep - that is why I am there! Was too tired to go and complain to change...bad on me. But at times when I make it crystal clear what I want and there was a 50/50 chance of the room on the right side of the building....so much for customer service.</p><br>Best salad for a long time<p>One night stopover awaiting onward flight to San Francisco. Stayed at several Marriott Courtyards before (all pretty much the same) - but this one produced a really good, fresh salad. Not a lot to ask really - but San Francisco salads seemed to consist of lettuce - full stop.</p><br>Clean &amp; Pleasant<p>No problem, no hustle while I was staying this hotel. The overall was clean and pleasant. One thing what I really liked about this hotel is peaceful and quiet comparing to other major hotels since it's kind of away from the main road and Strip.</p><br>Just average<p>Bed was not very comfortable as the mattress was a bit hard and the mattress cover kept coming loose and bunching up. Noise from room above (why put someone underneath someone else when the hotel is 1/3 full?), mediocre exercise facility, nice pool. Just average overall (and why not include breakfast like other Marriott properties next door?).</p><br>Ok for a long stay<p>My experience in this hotel is quite good.
I was in Las Vegas for business and I stayed there for two weeks. At the beginning I was a bit concerned that a room at the ground floor was assigned to me, but fortunately it was on the quite side of the hotel, so I always had good sleep.
I've heard from colleagues that the rooms on the other side are noisier because of the near road.
The room was big and clean, the bathroom as well.
Maybe furniture a little bit old fashioned but I saw the same in other similar hotels.
The people at the reception were friendly and helpful.
The breakfast was quite good and various. I haven't tried the dinner.
There are shuttles going to two different points in the Strip and it's quite convenient. The only small remark is that the shuttle going closer to the center should be the one going more often, but it's the other way around. Anyway it was always easy to go to the Strip and go back with the shuttle.
I had good experience also with the shuttle to the airport.
Room Tip: Ask fpr a room facing the parking place and not the main road

Tables aren't set for dinner so you wouldn't even that know they serve dinner. Limited dinner menu, and mediocre food. Breakfast buffet was fine. I didn't see any restaurants within walking distance.

Biggest word of caution: Don't get a room facing the freeway! Really loud, and we were on the 3rd floor. I slept so poorly that we left after the first night.
Room Tip: Demand a room that DOESN'T overlook the Strip. You would also overlook and hear the freeway tra...

The shuttle schedule was okay but wish they had a pick up and drop off location a little further down the strip. The staff was friendly and all but one was very helpful. There was one that seriously needs trained on explaining the shuttle schedule and how it all works. By the time I went around the world with her 3 times just to find out if we had missed the 10:00 am shuttle, I was exhausted. All the other staff was very friendly and accommodating. The rooms are comfortable. We were lucky enough to get one with a balcony above the pool. I enjoyed standing out there in the warm sun to have my coffee.
No one ever explained the breakfast set up to us but we finally figured out on our own that the continental items are free. Hot food items are apparently $10 per person. No biggie. We just wanted to grab a bagel and go.
Overall a nice place to stay if you don't care to be in the thick of all the strip activities. I would definitely stay again.</p><br></body></html>
