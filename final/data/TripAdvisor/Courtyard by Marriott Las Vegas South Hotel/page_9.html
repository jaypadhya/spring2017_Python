<html><head><h3>Courtyard by Marriott Las Vegas South Hotel Reviews Page 9</h3></head><body><br>Great Customer Service Very Friendly Staff!<p>The staff at this hotel is very friendly. I have to travel to Vegas for work and have stayed at this hotel a few times now. It is clean the food is good for a quick bite to eat after a long day at work. After my second stay the staff already called me by name. Great place to stay off the strip with free shuttle service to the strip.</p><br>Convenient, comfortable stop<p>Stayed for two nights on business. Very convenient to the airport with none of the craziness or traffic of the strip. Rooms were clean and the staff was very nice. Only complaint is that the gym was pretty small but everything else was up to par.</p><br>On our way through<p>We needed a place to stay to return our rental car at the end of our vacation and catch a flight out the next morning. The location was perfect for these needs. Everything was pretty much what you would expect from a Marriott. The beds were comfortable and rooms were "businesslike" nice. The shuttle to the airport was quick and easy. It was nice to get a bit away from the craziness of Vegas.... The only downside of the particular night we stayed was the lack of sleep we got. We stayed on the second floor and heard footsteps on the floor above us all night. Our neighbors next door had some sort of disagreement as well and there was a period of screaming and hollering we had to endure in the early morning hours as well.</p><br>Is staying in Vegas not looking for glamour<p>This is a well priced place to stay of visiting for anything else but the glamour. Went there for a gymnastics event and their shuttle service to and from the strip and the airport sufficed our two night stay. Well priced and with nice spacious rooms, fulfilled my son's and my own needs.</p><br>Comfortable and close to Las Vegas airport<p>The Marriotts are always a good choice wherever you are. Always comfortable and clean and the employees are always cheerful and helpful. Love the complimentary cookies at the front desk. The only disappointing thing about this particular hotel was that they did not have complimentary breakfast although they had breakfast that could be purchased.</p><br>Courtyard Comfort<p>Great hotel. We booked this on Priceline and was totally surprised at what we discovered. From the time of checkin to checkout was a great experience. Staff was very friendly and helpful. The hotel has a nice gym and restaurant. The room as very nicely decorated, clean and very comfortable beds. It is off the strip down by the convention center but a short cab ride down to the main strip. If the Vegas lights and noise is not your cup of tea then this is the place to be. I loved it. And got a great price for it.
Room Tip: As with any hotel get a room that is not facing parking lot or street....

This location is very close to the Mandalay Bay Hotel and provides a free shuttle to both their and the New York New York. They have a small bar that offers great happy hour prices and food during football season.</p><br>Nice hotel in Vegas for business travelers<p>Away from the casinos and close to the airport. Clean and nice. I had one small in-room issue and the staff jumped in it. They have free Internet and a nice hot breakfast. Free papers on the lobby and a small workout room. Shuttles run to the strip, but you need taxis to go elsewhere. About $20 to the airport.
Room Tip: Always be mindful if interstates near you.

I decided to book a room here and am glad I did. The rooms were affordable and clean...just what I needed. Upon check-in I received a welcome bag with bottled water, an apple, and a Kashi bar.

A few items to note:
-This location is off The Strip, but a short quarter mile drive gets you there in a heartbeat. With hourly shuttles we had no issues getting to and from our desired locations.
-Another short drive gets you to a little shopping are with many restaurants and stores.
-An outdoor pool and fitness facility is available, but I had no time to use.
-The hotel location is in the flight path for the airport so light sleepers may want to take note. I personally had no problem with the noise.
-A hot breakfast bar is available but there is a $7 charge.</p><br></body></html>
