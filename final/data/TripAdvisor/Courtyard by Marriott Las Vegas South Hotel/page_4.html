<html><head><h3>Courtyard by Marriott Las Vegas South Hotel Reviews Page 4</h3></head><body><br>Very nice!<p>I read reviews on this hotel before we booked it and people complained about the noise from the airport. Yes, the hotel is near the airport which is nice actually. However, I never heard airport noise unless we were sitting by the pool. Even then the noise we heard was from helicopters taking people on tours. The hotel was clean and very friendly! We rode the shuttle to Mandalay Bay or the Aria every day. The shuttles were on time and very courteous. Breakfast was amazing! No its not free, but we had made to order omelets and waffles! We would definitely stay here again!!</p><br>Great stay<p>Came in for one night with friends. Service at check in was friendly. Shuttle service was excellent and informative. Breakfast was perfect and loved the made to order omelets. Sat out at pool before checkout. Hotel was very clean and in order. I would recommend to friends and will stay again.</p><br>Noisy and disappointing bed/bedding<p>I would give this 5 stars for the service but I had such a lousy night's sleep I can't give better than 3 stars. My room had two queen beds. The first one I selected had such a serious slant towards the floor it was ridiculous. That would have been ok if the bedding hadn't been so bad. The elastic on the sheets was so tired that the sheets would not stay tucked in. The mattress pad ( the mattress flimsy piece of material) didn't go to the edge of the bed and kept getting bunched up. I finally gave up, moved all my luggage off the other bed. It was better but not the Marriott comfort I have come to expect. Airplane s take off and land most of the night. Totally inadequate sound proofing. Had a terrible nights sleep and will not return.</p><br>good alternative of the strip hotels<p>We always stayed at the hotels on the strip in past visits. This time to use the free night certificates we decided on stay at the Courtyard based on the good reviews. We're very satisfied with the stay. Front desk staff Jennifer was very professional and really took care of us. We asked for a room facing away from the freeway and it's quiet. Room is also very clean and comfortable, better than most of the Courtyard I've stayed at.

Overall the hotel is a very good alternative if you don't need a casino attached, and prefer smoke free. We see many families with kids stayed here.</p><br>Excellent stay<p>I do not have any complaints about our stay. Everything was perfect, the staff were very friendly at all times. We had to extend our stay and they were incredibily helpful. We also used the shuttle service to the airport. Breakfast was a great experience every morning. I really recommend this hotel. It's not at the strip, but really close by car. It's great to stay if you have your family and want to stay away from all the craziness of the strip.</p><br>Close to airport, strip, 15 &amp; 215 fwy<p>I have stayed here several times as it is a convenient hotel to where I need to go when here on business. With that said, this Courtyard is definitely in need of renovations (similar to what Marriott has done with most of the other courtyard marriott's). Nothing has changed in this hotel in years but I hear that renovations are coming in the next year or so which will be great! I will tell you to be careful when checking in to make sure you do not get a handicap room (unless you need one) as I got one by mistake today and I can tell you this room is not used very often as both phones did not work, there was no coffee maker and the towels looked worn.... As what I find with almost all Marriott's, the women at check in was very nice and was able to get me a new room even though the hotel is completely booked. My new room is clean and quiet and I am happy. I definitely recommend this hotel for convenience and the staff is very nice.</p><br>Great stay in Las Vegas<p>Choose this hotel to be near the strip but not have the hustle and bustle of the strip. It is located at the southern end of the strip near the I15 with a cluster of hotels, the area was very safe and quite. You could walk to the strip approx. 30 mins to the mandalay bay casino. There is a shuttle bus from the hotel to the strip that runs until the early hours.

The room we had was large with fridge/microwave and sofa, good size TV and nice size bathroom. Food service in reception for breakfast and dinner, also a bar area. Swimming pool not bad size and is heated good area to relax at but a bit cold in December.

Overall a relaxing stay, delivered what you expect from a Marriott Courtyard well done to the hotel team.
Green Features: Good recycle practices at the hotel, able to recycle most of our trash</p><br>Great stay<p>we were here for work, and the staff were great and very accommodating. Due to working shift hours, they were happy to open breakfast early on occasions and try and fit in our every need.

Great shuttle bus service to new york new york and mandalay bay.</p><br>Very clean, perfect place for a family vacation<p>Easy check in , staff was friendly and helpful . No smell of smoke which is a plus for my family. 10mins from the strip not bad.great experience would definitely stay here again .
Thanks Marriott hotel for your service.</p><br>Nice hotel, great staff<p>We stayed for one night with our family of 6. The rooms were comfortable, the beds were soft but firm enough for a good nights sleep and the bedding was cozy. The hotel was quiet despite the abundance of air traffic in the area and it was a refreshing change from other hotels in the area. It is close enough to the strip to be convenient if you want to see that part of Vegas but nothing like a casino hotel. We ate both dinner and breakfast in the lounge and it was better than we expected for a very fair price. The best thing about this hotel is the staff. They are polite, attentive, helpful, and responsive. There were several minor maintenance needs and one cleanliness issue in one of our rooms and the response was warm and genuine. We would definitely stay here again.</p><br></body></html>
