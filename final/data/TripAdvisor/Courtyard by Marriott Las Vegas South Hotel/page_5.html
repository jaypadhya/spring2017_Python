<html><head><h3>Courtyard by Marriott Las Vegas South Hotel Reviews Page 5</h3></head><body><br>Great in every way.<p>We had an outstanding stay at this off the strip hotel. The property is conveniently located for just about anything you would want to do in Las Vegas. It is a very affordable option for families that don't want to stay on the strip. Our room was very clean and comfortable, the staff was friendly and eager to please, and the location felt safe for my family. I recommend this property highly.</p><br>Quiet, hospitable UN-Casino hotel<p>I visit Las Vegas annually for a large trade show. In the past I stayed at several traditional casino hotels but didn't enjoy the long walk through the casino to get to an elevator; and
since I don't gamble this had no appeal.

Courtyard is a great alternative for the traveler. Like any Courtyard property, it's immaculately taken care of, and staff are friendly and engaging. This location is convenient to the airport (10 minute ride with a free shuttle from hotel to airport), and located adjacent to the I-15 expressway. Parking is free.

Price is a good value for the area, and all the usual Courtyard amenities (breakfast buffet, bar in the evening, free internet and printing stations...) were available.

My only (very minor) negative was that because of the proximity to the freeway, the area is a bit noisy.
Room Tip: Ask for a room opposite the highway side.

The staff was top notch due to ease of check-in, information about the hotel and general area. What was really nice was that they treated you like they were glad to see you! Room was spacious, clean and beds & pillows were very comfy. Buffet breakfast is excellent from the warm/cold foods, pastries to personalized omelets. Again wait staff very prompt, helpful and personable. Greatest compliment.............we will stay here again.
Room Tip: We asked for a higher room so no one above us and facing the strip. Nice view especially at night.

We are hosting a couple business meetings with our best customers, and we have been treated very well by the staff, who are courteous, efficient, and professional. I must single out Riontay, who manages the front desk with a consistently pleasant and fun attitude. A visit to the front desk has never been so fun!</p><br>For this type of Hotel very good and I would stay again<p>For this type of Hotel very good and I would stay again, really nothing to complain about priced about right, choose this hotel using points but would definitely stay again not far from the strip.... no free breakfast though :(
Room Tip: get to the pool before 5pm or you will lose the sun :(

Chose this hotel & glad we did. Staff was all friendly & knowledgable. Free business library allowed us to print boarding passes. Room was spacious & clean - we had a 2nd floor room overlooking the pool, no balcony, near the elevator. Didn't find either pool or hallway noise to be bad. A bit of airplane noise late at night, but nothing to keep us awake or requiring earplugs. Had both dinner & breakfast in the hotel restaurant - both were very delicious.</p><br>Good hotel, great value!<p>First of all, there really isn't anything to complain about with this Courtyard. I'm not a picky traveler, but stay almost exclusively (and frequently) at Courtyards and other Marriott properties due to frequent business travel. For Vegas, it's not bad at all for an off-the-strip hotel. Most hotels in Vegas are fraying around the edges, with the usual lineup of worn furniture, dirty carpeting, towel racks loose on the wall, etc. This Courtyard is well-kept and the rate I got was reasonable. I also REALLY appreciate the occasional free room upgrade -- and this Courtyard upgraded me to a suite. When you travel as much as I do, it's nice to once in a while have a hotel room that's at least a little bit more like home, with separate living and bedroom areas. The only comment I have -- and this is a strange one -- when I walked into my room BOTH thermostats had been turned all the way down to 55 degrees and the entire suite was positively frigid. A real meat locker! It was so cold in the room (yes, it was actually 55 degrees) that it took several hours for the chill to go away. I'm mentioning this mainly because I'm wondering why housekeeping didn't adjust the thermostat to something more appropriate for human life (say, maybe 70 degrees) when they cleaned the room after the previous occupant departed? Egads, it was cold in there! I like a nice air-conditioned room, but that was quite an experience!</p><br>Great location, great value, clean, pleasant stay!<p>We were so pleased to find this Courtyard in Vegas. It was a fantastic stay for the price paid. Within minutes, we were on the main strip and to and from the airport and the hotel. The room was very spacious for four people, two queen beds. There was a nice coffee station in the room....bathrooms provided ample toiletries. This was your standard Marriott-Courtyard hotel, but everything was super well maintained and service was great.

The pool outside was about 8 or 9/10 for cleanliness. The pool area was very spacious and decorated nicely with palm trees. Be aware that planes are regularly flying overhead every few minutes, but we enjoyed watching them fly in so low. Remember, we paid just $100/night, and you are really close to the airport.

The breakfast buffet is usually 7.99/person, but the front receptionist gave us one coupon as a discount...thus, breakfast was only 5.99. They had fresh omelettes made to order, along with fresh fruit, and many other options for yogurt, potatoes, sausages, cereals, etc. Quite an impressive (fresh) selection for the price. The chef making the omelettes was very pleasant and even brought out the eggs to your table.

If you need a place to stay for the night, don't want to pay more to be in downtown on the Strip, and enjoy cleanliness and comfort, this is an excellent option.</p><br>Really, Really Nice Hotel<p>I stayed at this Courtyard while on a business trip. I was very satisfied with it. I stay at Marriott properties almost exclusively, but some are better than others. I would rank this one in the top 5%. The front desk staff were friendly and accommodating, the rooms were clean, and the lobby / food area was very nice. I had breakfast there, and the food was also very good.</p><br>Excellent hotel for business traveler<p>I stayed here for one night as I flew through McCarran on business. I didn't take advantage of much the hotel has to offer like the bar, pool, or shuttle. The front desk staff was courteous and called my room after check in to make sure my stay began nicely. The front desk staff did assist in helping me get a taxi (their shuttle only goes to certain destinations). My room was clean, had a small fridge, and large bathroom. It was clean. It was nice that each bed had soft and firm pillows labeled with small embroidery on the pillow case for identification. I would definitely stay here again on business.</p><br></body></html>
