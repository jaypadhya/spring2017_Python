<html><head><h3>Hampton Inn Las Vegas/Summerlin Hotel Reviews Page 18</h3></head><body><br>Wonderful stay at the Hampton Inn/Summerlin<p>I stayed here with my friends for EDC, and it was a very pleasant experience! It is further away from the strip, but this worked out for this weekend because traffic getting to and from the strip was ridiculous. We were able to take streets to the speedway from this hotel, and there was hardly any traffic arriving to the event. Also, the complimentary breakfast was perfect when we arrived back to the hotel in the morning! Everything was comfortable and clean, and it was an overall excellent experience for good value. I definitely recommend this hotel to anyone!</p><br>Nice location away from the Strip<p>We were just passing through on our way to Yosemite, so this was a great location for us. The room was very nice, the breakfast selection was good, and restaurants were close by (mostly fast food types).
Room Tip: Choose a room away from the pool, elevator, and ice machine for more quiet
See more room tips</p><br>Very comfortable<p>One of the best hotels in Las Vegas, Very quiet, clean and the service is good. Located a quiet location. This hotel has a affordable laundry service. Good Parking and security. Room rates are affordable for families. We will stay here again.</p><br>Smoky room -Ick<p>Rushing to get the room booked on Hilton's website, I didn't notice I'd booked a smoking room for the night. Called them to change my preference to find out I'd just reserved the last room which was a smoking room. No refund possible so we suffered through it. The smell was disgusting even after spraying the air filters and the room. In spite of the smell. we experienced standard above average Hampton treatment. Breakfast was hot with plentiful choices. The room was spacipus, clean and included a small fridge.
Room Tip: avoid smoking rooms unless you're a smoker!
See more room tips</p><br>Great experience<p>We enjoyed the cleanliness of our room, the quiet and the comfortable beds. Breakfast was great! Even bacon, eggs bisquits and gravy! Business center, fitness room and pool were all in great shape. I would return to this location</p><br>A Short Driv to The Strip<p>If you are looking for a value motel that has good staff, good rooms and convenient location to many restaurants and even some casinos then I recommend this hotel. This time they were so busy with the EDC event that you could hardly turn around. The room was clean and a king bed as ordered with the usual basic amenities. The grounds were well kept and I noticed they even have preferred parking for certain guests which is a nice touch. The only complaint is that the breakfasts lack a bit of quality. I would gladly pay an extra $1 or $2 if they upgraded them to real eggs. Other than that I have no complaints and despite the crowd of enthusiastic EDC folks the noise level was virtually unnoticeable. I would for sure stay here again given the reasonable rates and short distance to either The Strip or Old Towne.
Room Tip: Many restaurants in the area for good food. Macaroni Grill, Sweet Tomatoes an all you can eat salad...

We have stayed at the Casacades Valley Court Hampton in Summerlin many times and they have always delivered - this hotel is my first choice when visiting our relatives in Las Vegas.</p><br>This is more of a Motel 6<p>Skip this Hampton Inn. The staff is good, but -- Dirty carpet, dirty elevator not that great of a breakfast. Outside security door did not work, trash can overflowing. Management really needs to work on this place.
Room Tip: Don't chose one.
