The rooms are very clean and roomy. And they make cookies at 7pm which after a hard day of work-away from home...makes the homemade cookies even more enjoyable.</p><br>Hampton Inn - Tenaya<p>Place has quick access to freeways, quiet location - tucked in on their own cul-de-sac. Accommodation is good for the value, check in staff was very nice, check-out not so much. Free breakfast is a real plus as well as the internet access though connectivity can use some help. Overall satisfied with stay and would definitely come back.</p><br>It's a Hampton<p>Clean room, friendly people, nothing special. Definitely not renovated like a lot of the newer looking Hamptons. Extremely loud due to highway nearby. Double beds were not comfortable. They were unable to move me to a quieter room, but fell short of telling me why. The parking lot was not full, so... Breakfast was the typical uninspiring Hampton. Picnic style plates and silverware, paper thin "bacon", neon eggs. They try to pass it as "eco-friendly", but it all goes in the trash? I wanted to be off the strip closer to my place of work, but for $5 more, I stayed at a world class Hilton on the strip for the remainder of my trip.</p><br>Hampton Summerlin Great Stay<p>Quick and easy access to business locations, highway and the entire area surrounding Las Vegas. Facilities are very well maintained. Staff is extremely helpful and cheerful. I have come back to this particular hotel numerous times, and will continue to do so.</p><br>Our stay at the Summerlin Hampton Inn<p>My teen son and I stayed at this property over a recent holiday weekend. We were very pleased with the amenities including a delicious breakfast spread and yummy fresh baked cookies at the desk. The staff made every effort to create a warm and inviting atmosphere. We will be back!!</p><br>Location<p>I liked the location of this Hampton. It was close enough to the strip if I wanted to go but far enough to be away from the madness. There were many amenities at this location, (i.e., places to eat, shop, including Target and Walmart.)</p><br>I would stay again<p>Clean rooms, helpful staff, decent hot breakfast in the morning. Tiny gym but clean. Pool is small also but maintained well. Security is iffy but the area seems generally safe. It's far from the strip but plenty of restaurants close by and things to do.</p><br>Great Stay!<p>This was a Hampton Inn and not the newer Hampton Inn & Suites. Although the outside appearance is looking slightly old....the inside was beautifully furnished and looking quite new and well kept! The staff were very friendly and accommodated all of our needs. Breakfast, in my opinion, was better than some of the other Hampton Inn & Suites that we have booked. Overall....exceptional value!</p><br>Wonderful Staff<p>Stayed here for a business trip and loved it. Super friendly staff that met my needs eagerly and happily. I love the andes mints <3. Hot tub was great after a long day of physical training and walking the strip. Comfy, clean room</p><br>personal<p>It took me less than a minutes to chedk in. staff extremely friendly gave me a bag with two diet cokes, two M and M candies and more quiet , slept like a baby. asked for wake up call and it was accurante, i found my room easily i would go back in a heart beat</p><br></body></html>
