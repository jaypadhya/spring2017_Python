The breakfast attendants kept everything clean and restocked. The beds were comfortable. It also felt safe, I wasn't worried about the security of my car in the parking lot. I would absolutely stay here again.</p><br>My FREE night wasn't free!<p>One of the places our company uses when we travel nationally is Hampton. I experienced problems with a Hampton hotel at the Chicago Midway property. I was given a Be My Guest pass and decided to give the brand another try. I was supposed to stay for a night with my wife at the Summerlin property. My 83 year old mother-in-law broke her wrist that day and I had to cancel the reservation. I understand the no refund policy if the reservation isn't cancelled 24 hours prior to any stay. This was an emergency. I am a 53 year old man, not someone who trifles with corporate policies at a whim. So, I my credit card was immediately charged after I cancelled the reservation..... FOR A FREE NIGHT! The manager did say that she would waive the fee IF I PROVIDED PROOF OF THE EMERGENCY. Again, I am a 53 year old man, not someone who trifles with corporate policies at a whim. So thankfully my wife had taken a picture of my mother-in-law while she was in the hospital. This is the same 'proof', that I emailed the manager. She did reverse the charge of $122.08, but in doing so, caused 2 other charges of, $103.77 and $18.31 to appear on my card. All three charges were reversed. Wouldn't it have been nice if the manager didn't piss off a traveler whose company uses Hampton Inn? I have talked to my boss, the owner of our company about using Hilton properties in the future. Our company policy is changing to exclusively use anyone else but Hilton properties as there have been problems in the past. By the way, I'm still waiting for a formal apology from the manager about the 3 charges.</p><br>Great place to stay<p>This hotel is clean, with updated furniture. The breakfast was good with the exception of the powdered eggs. Location is good for my purpose of seeing family members. There are many close restaurants to choose from.</p><br>Super stay, staff and breakfast!<p>Stayed at this Hampton Inn on Thanksgiving night and was surprised by the fantastic service. The hotel is located in a nice area that is easily accessible to the major highway 95. The room was large, clean and fully stocked with Nutregena toiletry products. The seating area in the room was perfect for my children to play cards and draw on. The beds were extremely soft and not at all supportive. The decor is simple but sparse. The morning "continental breakfast" was fantastic. They had a huge variety (omelets, waffles, muffins, pastries, yogurt, hash-browns...). I paid about $150 for this room and felt like it was a bit high for Las Vegas. It is far from the strip and more in a business area. Overall, it is a great choice if your staying outside of the stip area and need to reach the highway quickly.</p><br>great stay!<p>We were very surprised and pleased with this hotel. Rooms are roomy and clean. Staff is very helpful and nice. They also have a great breakfast! We would recommend Hampton Inn Summerlin/Las Vegas to everyone!</p><br>Excellent value<p>Great place to stay and excellent value for your money. I give this location my highest recomendation. Drive to the strip is not complicted and takes 15 minutes or less, but up to 30 minutes if during morning rush hours.</p><br>Staff very professional and friendly<p>Have security on site at night to patrol the area and hotel to make sure no craziness is happening. Facility is very clean and up to date. The fitness center only had one treadmill so I needed to get up early if I wanted to get on and use it in the morning.</p><br>This hotel was dirty and never felt Clean<p>This hotel from the moment I walked in never felt clean. It only got worse as I got to my room, there was rust on the bath tub fixtures and tub. The carpet was soiled and looked dirty. The room smelt so bad, I couldn't believe it. I have had to stay in smoking rooms before, but never smelled anything like this. I couldn't hardly breathe in this room. I was almost horrified and couldn't wait to get out of there the next morning. I didn't want to touch anything.</p><br>Great Location, Great Service<p>Enjoyed our stay. Staff was friendly and helpful. Rooms were clean, quiet, comfortable. The location of the hotel is off main street and was slightly difficult to find. However, there is little or no street noise. Breakfast was nice -- many choices and fresh everyday.</p><br>Excellent place to stay<p>This is absolutely my favorite place to Stay in Vegas. Judy and Jo make it a great place and always have the best customer service. I cannot say enough about the staff in general, but Jo, Judy, and the two cooking ladies. They are absolutely amazing and everyone deserves a raise as far as I am concerned. I think they should be recognized for the job they do!</p><br></body></html>
