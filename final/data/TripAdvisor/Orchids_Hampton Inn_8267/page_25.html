<html><head><h3>Hampton Inn Las Vegas/Summerlin Hotel Reviews Page 25</h3></head><body><br>Nice hotel, staff is REALLY nice<p>I have stayed here twice so far on business. The staff is very, very nice. The first time I booked online on Travelocity and this time I was just a walk-in. Complimentary breakfast was a real breakfast, not continental breakfast.</p><br>So Nice!<p>We have stayed here a number of times and love all the nice touches, such as chocolate mints in the lobby at all times, and fresh hot cookies in the evenings. The breakfast is better than most, with some hot choices, healthy choices, and bakery donuts! We like that there is no casino. The rooms are very spacious, clean and comfortable. Great friendly staff. Look forward to staying here again.</p><br>Very Nice Hampton<p>Broke out of my mold and stayed here vs the Doubletree. Nice location, still a quiet hotel. If the strip is not your bag, this is a good choice. A little cloaser to the west end of town so a good launching point if you are successful in getting out the City.</p><br>If you can't get into a convention hotel!<p>Due to several large conventions in town, the convention hotel and all of the nearby hotels were filled. This property is located about 20 minutes from the large convention sites. For a one night stay it is a good choice. The staff is friendly and helpful. Their advice regarding driving times was useful. Although located adjacent to the highway, I didn't hear roadway noises.

This hotel will meet your expections of a Hilton property.

I had an 8:30am flight from the Las Vegas airport. I left the hotel at 6:30am and had the car returned to the Airport Rental Car Garage by 7:00am. I was through airport security and at the gate by 7:35am.</p><br>A hotel without Casino<p>Lobby needs a paint job or something. It feels dingy. However it is a standard Hampton Inn so the rooms are good and there is a standard hot breakfast in the morning if you are not too picky. I have been told it is one of the few hotels in Las Vegas without a casino. My wife and I don't gamble so this was a welcome find.</p><br>Nice property; couple of minor details<p>One night stay passing through Vegas and with some personal business this side of town. Nice property; room was good, everything "worked", and I slept well.

Couple of minor details...not showstoppers:

(1) Shower curtain mounted too high; impossible to keep inside the tub so floor got completely wet. Not sure if just in my room (147) or a property-wide issue.

(2) Went to breakfast at "prime time" at 7:30AM; the hot items were all cold and no microwave avaialble, attendent also had no napkins for guests. I took a tray and brought my breakfast back to my room and heated it up in my in-room microwave.

Would still consider returning; these are correctable issues.</p><br>Great!<p>We were in town for a swim meet at the nearby aquatic center. We were able to check in a bit early, which we appreciated, so our kiddo could get ready for the meet. The lady at the desk was very friendly and helpful. Room was clean, had plenty of towels, a nice TV, and white duvet covers. Everything was fresh and clean. The breakfast was fantastic...maybe one of the best free breakfasts we have had. Fresh fruit, yogurt, waffles, cereal, eggs. Perfect for our schedule, and for our type of trip. We saw other sports teams there, too, so it is probably popular for that. We will definitely stay here again when we are in Las Vegas for a meet.
Room Tip: If you are a light sleeper, ask for a room that doesn't face the freeway. Not a deal breaker for...

They always have something for everyone when it comes to breakfast. Coffee and tea available all the time. They even helped me sign up for their Honors program.</p><br>Nice Hotel for Business<p>This hotel is a great choice for business travelers. Service is excellent and accomodations are perfect for the business traveler. The free coffee/hot chocolate and cookies provided in the lobby, around the clock, is an added bonus. The rooms are clean and provide everything you need while traveling - iron & ironing board, good quality wireless internet access (free), small refrigerator, microwave, coffee pot, hair dryer, and a bed that is more comfortable than most.</p><br>Business<p>I have a small real estate rental company in Las Vegas and travel there two or three times a year to review things. I stay in the NW area because that is where the properties are. I have stayed at this hotel three times now and am never disappointed.</p><br></body></html>
