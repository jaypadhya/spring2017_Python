Upon arrival, we realized their rooms didn't have mini-refrigs in them, so we asked to see what was available with one. The desk clerk immediately offered us an upgrade to a suite with a king bed at no additional charge. It was a beautiful suite and so spacious. I really appreciated this. We enjoyed our stay here.
t</p><br>Clean ,conveniently located hotel<p>Stayed one night there. Well situated near Hwy. 95,yet calm , like an oasis..Helpful staff. Good quality breakfeast and nice pface to enjoy it. Room tidy The only unpleasant thing, and I must say it was quite surprising, is that we able to hear walking people upstairs, we had room on 2nd floor.To the point that vibrations were easily perceptible.Unfortunately for us ,the guest on top of us, or close,woke very early, by 04:00hres, took a nice long shower,and kept walking in his room until we had to leave. Very surprising .In doudt, ask for room on upper floor. Besides, very goog hotel.
Room Tip: Ask for romm on upper floor

I travel a lot and stay at this Hampton exclusively, makes my trips away from home that much easier to bear.</p><br>Excellent Business and Family Friendly Hotel<p>I enjoyed my stay very much at Hampton Inn Las Vegas - Summerlin. It was conveniently located to the highway and had all the amenities needed for a business traveler or a family looking for a comfortable location.

The breakfast is excellent and I think just about everyone could find something they would like, from the waffle making machine to the yogurt, fruit, pastries, cereal, etc., all the way to the hot breakfast items that included an egg and meat item both days I was there. There were families as well as business people at the breakfast area and plenty of space for everyone to sit, relax, and enjoy a morning meal.

I even was checked in early when I arrived - a nice thing for the staff to do. In fact, everyone I met and dealt with on the staff always smiled and greeted me. It was just fantastic to be around such friendly people.

Next time I am in town and need a hotel, I will not hesitate to stay here.</p><br>Nice Hotel<p>it was nice not to hear siren and drunk people wakin us up in middle of night like hotels/casinos The was nice surprise. Only real down side is while location not in middle of action, taxi cab services cd too high prices to and from the downtown strip are. Great side is close to shopping and other activities, and from freeway locations</p><br>Great bed &amp; Breakfast Hotel. Super clean.<p>This Hampton Inn is in the quieter NW section of Las Vegas. Superior beds and pillows. Free WiFi, parking, 24-hour coffee bar in lobby, and breakfast. Very clean and accommodating. We will stay here again!!!</p><br>Great Neighborhood Hotel<p>We often use this hotel when we're in town to take care of our rental business. The staff is friendly and efficient; the internet is free, easy to access and reliable; their business center is free, always available, and has printers that work; their breakfast is good and available very early; there is coffee, tea and cookies available every night ... plus their rooms are clean and well maintained.</p><br>Really nice choice for the price<p>Located outside Las Vegas, this Summerlin area Hampton Inn is very nice. The staff was terrific, breakfast and the dining area was very good with many choices. The hotel has a very nice feel to it.

Plenty of places to eat around the area.</p><br>Family Trip<p>We found that the staff on check-in and throughout our stay was friendly and helpful. We found the room to be clean and quiet. The bathroom/shower was okay. The breakfast provided was hot and they had a good variety of items from which to choose. The only complaint I have was with the beds. The bed we were in was not very comfortable and sunk a bit in the middle. We just did not sleep well for the two nights we were there. The other item to remember is that the beds are only double and not queen size. Otherwise, we were satisfied with our stay. We have stayed at many other Hampton Inn hotels and did not have any problems.</p><br>Great stay<p>Good room, clean, good continental b-fast...what more could you ask for? We stayed one night after flying into LV to head towards Virginia City. We booked through Expedia - $78 per night...this is well worth that. Cant go wrong booking with this Hampton.</p><br></body></html>
