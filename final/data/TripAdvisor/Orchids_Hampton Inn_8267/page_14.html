The rooms are nice and breakfast is the usual hotel breakfast .I would definitely stay there again.it is right off the highway but when you look for Cascade Valley Court it is a very small sign.</p><br>Good Hotel/Great staff<p>Hampton like all others a good quality/value brand. Front desk staff very friendly, accomodating and helpful. We were there for location to attend a wedding. The location is great. The hotel is clean. Amenities are good. Staff is friendly. This is a good hotel for all types of travellers.</p><br>My second choice, but perfectly adaquate.<p>I found the hotel to be clean and quiet. Most everything was excellent for this level of hotel. Staff did a good job as expected. This hotel was my second choice. I booked late, so the higher level hotels that I wanted in this area were already fully booked.</p><br>Wonderful Stay!<p>We stayed 2 nights. This hotel is 15 min to the Strip. But we paid half of what a lesser hotel would have cost there. The staff is attentive and very nice. Very clean with the usual comfy beds, free wifi and good breakfast. A/C worked well. This place is real close to the Red Rock Canyon, and not that far from Death Valley. We enjoyed not staying on the strip but it was easy to get in for dinner and a show. Highly recommended.</p><br>The best customer service!<p>We stayed over the Labor Day weekend to visit family and are so glad we chose this hotel. The location worked out really well for us and not being at a Casino was a nice change when visiting Las Vegas. From the time we walked in, to check out, there was nothing but excellent service. We had a minor issue with the tub plunger which I mentioned when were going out for the day and they had someone up there immediately to fix. The breakfasts served in the mornings were great and included in the price of the stay. Each day was a different hot meal, plus the usual waffles, toast, cereals, fresh fruit. No complaints! The bath and sleeping area were clean and fresh smelling. The fridge was the perfect size for extra water bottles and our left over meals. Oh yeah, the vending machine wasn't functioning correctly and took our money. When we went to the desk to let them know, she immediately refunded the money and brought us some bottles from the stash back there. Total customer service!

As a final, "they are wonderful in customer service", I actually left all my clean clothes hanging in the closet (dang) and realized it the morning after I got home. I called the front desk and sure enough, they had them bagged up and waiting. She had them in FedEx that day for delivery.

I would definitely stay again for the family visit. I can't say enough good things.</p><br>Clean, quiet, comfortable<p>Clean, quiet hotel. Very friendly and helpful staff. Nice breakfast bar. Free, hot coffee available 24-7. I could stay almost anywhere in town, but would prefer to just stay here to relax and stay away from the hussle and bustle of the strip. The strip is just a short 15-20 minute drive if I do want some night life or shopping.</p><br>Great Value<p>Comfy beds, clean room, delicious breakfast with lots of hot choices, fresh fruit and yogurt. For some reason I did not have cell service in the room, but I took advantage of free Wifi. They even have Disney Channel on the TV for the kids.</p><br>Great Experience!<p>The rates were very reasonable, and the lobby and breakfast staff was very friendly who met every request. Fabulous breakfast and nice, clean room. I highly recommend this hotel. Great value! The location is close to the highway and with easy access.</p><br>Excellent economical hotel.<p>Very clean rooms and friendly staff. I highly recommend this place. The breakfast is great and has a terrific staff, especially Kevin Jackson. He set us up with a plate after we showed up late for breakfast. Thank you Kevin!</p><br>Best stay in Las Vegas<p>I have tried several motels/hotels/casinos in the Vegas area but have determined that for my money there is no better place than Hampton Inn. My needs have always been met there and the staff is always helpful. I also like the location on the north end of town.</p><br></body></html>
