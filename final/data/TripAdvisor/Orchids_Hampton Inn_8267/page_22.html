<html><head><h3>Hampton Inn Las Vegas/Summerlin Hotel Reviews Page 22</h3></head><body><br>Great stay<p>Our tennis team stayed here for the weekend with some very busy girls softball teams. Even though the motel was sold out, the staff was patient, helpful and smiley. The breakfast staff did an awesome job. I would definitely stay here again if the opportunity presented itself.</p><br>Problems with this hotel<p>Elevators were not working and newspapers did not arrive on 2 consecutive mornings. Room was noisy, facing US 95. Breakfast included those "pre-made" egg turnovers. There was no half and half for coffee, only "artificial" coffee mate.</p><br>Fantastic customer service<p>Probably the best customer service I've ever received at a hotel. A big thank you to the hotel staff! The room was large and comfortable. Fitness center was small but contained all new equipment. Nice breakfast. Cookies and chocolate mints at the front desk were a nice touch. Hotel was near I-95 but quiet. Overall, an excellent experience.</p><br>Just a FANTASTIC 6 Night Stay at the Hampton<p>My wife and I stayed for 6 nights so we had a chance to really see the hotel in operation. I would highly recommend this Hampton for an off strip location. Every staff member, from house keeping to the front desk, was extremely helpful, pleasant, and smiling. In particular, Judy at the front desk was fantastic at our check in and each evening. We had a larger king room and a large bathroom that was very comfortable in size and design. Beds were very comfortable as were the pillows and linens. Maid service was superior! Internet WIFI was a strong connection and speed. Business center had printers to print out boarding passes, too - nice! Breakfast area was large, well layed-out, and could accommodate a large number of people. Breakfast food was always ready at 5:00am and was traditional Hampton Inn fare. Coffee and cookies available every night too. Parking area was also well lighted and safe. Hampton was located off Tenaya Blvd in a business area near the hospital as well as across the street from a LaQuinta. It was a little tricky to find as it sits back off Tenaya and is tucked back in a corner..
I must say that a common concern about the hotel was Highway 95 noise but we did not find it bothersome at night. Also, no slot machines at the hotel - great!!! This is a great location for visiting Death Valley, Red Rock, Valley of Fire, and Lake Meade. Easy on and off of highway 95. Target, Walgreens, and Walmart close by as well as many restaurants within a few miles. You will be happy as the Summerlin Hampton is a superior Hampton property and we have stayed at many.
Room Tip: Corner king larger rooms are really nice! Higher floor too

The rooms nice, but the bathrooms a bit out dated. The beds were comfortable, however, they were small (doubles). There were only 2 of us, so it worked fine, but if I traveled with 4, it would be a tight squeeze for sleeping.</p><br>Nice Long Term Stay<p>I stayed at this property for more than 3 weeks on business. This is the nicest Hampton Inn I have stayed at. The breakfast staff, the front desk and the housekeeping staff were freindly and professional. This is the quietest hotel I have ever stayed at which is important when you are working odd shifts for 3 weeks straight. Absolutely nothing negative to say about my stay.</p><br>Not new, not run down, and very clean<p>This place is a bit tricky to find. It is not by any means a new property, but the cleanliness and helpfulness of the staff more than make up for it. The breakfast is typical for a Hampton Inn. I would stay here again if I am in the area. Congrats to the management for finding such friendly and helpful people to work here.
Room Tip: 3rd floor had good rooms, and don't have to deal with noise from a room above
See more room tips</p><br>Pleasant stay<p>Each employee we interacted with was extremely courteous and helpful. That always make a stay pleasant. The room was clean and spacious. The tech amenities were very good - there were even enough outlets.</p><br>Bed Mites<p>I woke up on Saturday with maybe one or two bites from bed mites. I did not think nothing of it until the following morning when I woke with more reddish bites all over my body. I have stayed at this hotel many times before and this is the first time that I have had problems with bed mites. Anyway, on previous visit I stayed on the third floor but this time I stayed on the first floor(smoking room). Generally, smoking rooms to me are a little bit more filthier than non-smoking rooms. There were no available non-smoking room when I checked in. I have to say tho, that the staff in this particular hotel are friendly, especially those that service the complimentary breakfast.</p><br>Great Place to Stay<p>Great Hotel. We were checked in quickly, they had homemade cookies at the counter for everyone, and we got our waters and trail mix since we are Gold members. The room was clean, great bed. The free full breakfast was great. Nice to have WII-Fi as well. The people working there were very friendly. Easy access to the freeway.</p><br></body></html>
