<html><head><h3>Hampton Inn Las Vegas/Summerlin Hotel Reviews Page 20</h3></head><body><br>Would stay again...<p>Overall hotel was ok. Check in staff ok. Room- carpet stained and dirty. Mattress could be replaced as it was lumpy. Bathroom was clean, shower did not drain properly. The tiles were cracked and needed updating. Location close to freeway, shops and strip.</p><br>Las Vegas Casino-free Motel<p>I needed a place to stay in Las Vegas over a Friday night but had no need for gambling or glitz or the price that goes with them. This clean, quiet, ordinary motel fit the bill. I didn't use the in-room fridge and microwave but they were there. Complimentary hot breakfast was OK--You could make your own waffles but that fact and the physical set-up made the line very slow.</p><br>Breakfast of champions and roomy!<p>We had plenty of room in the bathrooms and between the beds/ other furniture in the room. The breakfast was a tremendous variety even for the picky eaters in our 10 person group. Everyone enjoyed the breakfast eating area and the leisurely pace that the time frame allowed to eat. Loved the evening fresh baked cookie snack every night too!!</p><br>Fabulous Staff!<p>Extremely helpful staff. Had my 82 year old mother with me. She uses a walker. The front desk arranged for breakfast to be delivered to her in the room. It was really helpful and thoughtful. Great staff! Third time staying at this location.</p><br>nice place<p>was a good place to go, but to far from the strip especially if you wanted to be near the strip or you had plans near the strip, but i will come back. Breakfast was great but i wanted some bacon lol. I had a good workout in the gym which i needed lol. The front desk guy that first checked me in was nice and helpful, even when my online reservation was screwed up, but they made sure i got my money back</p><br>family visit<p>my family and i really enjoyed staying at the hampton Inn they were friendly and the rooms were clean and comfortable. we would totally re visit this hotel. the only thing i would say is that they need to create a better breakfast menu.</p><br>A comfortable well-maintained room<p>What I appreciate most is a comfortable bed and my bed at Hampton Inn in Las Vegas is one of the best I've come across in my travels. While the halls were a little on the warm side, they were clean and well-maintained. There was some traffic noise, so take some earplugs along. I would definitely stay there again</p><br>Stay-cation<p>Judy at the front desk was awesome!! She made our check-in extremely easy. The pool was very relaxing for my daughter after her softball games. Lots of choices for dining within 5 minutes from hotel location. A lot of noise from the freeway but a great place to get away. We will definately stay here again when my daughter has another softball tournament up at Majestic Park.</p><br>Good place<p>Great breakfast--better than most free hotel breakfasts. The check-in and check-out were easy..I even got an e-mail reminder about my trip details the week before I arrived. The staff was helpful and friendly--and gave great advice about where to get a specific cuisine. Also, free coffee and cookies all day!</p><br>Always a great stay<p>We have never had a bad experience at this hotel. The staff are always pleasant, helpful, smiling. You can tell they enjoy working there. The rooms are always clean. Breakfast food is good. If you can't stay for breakfast, they even have breakfast to go in a bag waiting for you. Don't forget the fresh baked cookies at night, mmmmm!</p><br></body></html>
