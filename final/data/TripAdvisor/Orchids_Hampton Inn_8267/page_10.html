<html><head><h3>Hampton Inn Las Vegas/Summerlin Hotel Reviews Page 10</h3></head><body><br>Nice Hotel<p>It's your standard Hampton Inn. Updated, clean, fitness center and of course a nice complimentary breakfast with eggs, a meat, biscuits, bagels, fruit, cereal and make your own waffle. The breakfast at this hotel starts at 5am which is helpful for us right coasters who wake up at 4am due to the time change. I had breakfast at 5am, my meeting wasn't until 10am so I had a second breakfast snack before I left.

The hotel is also close to a lot of food options and shopping plazas. A Target is just down the street in case you need to pick something up.

The street to the hotel is a little difficult to see. It's located behind an office and medical park and not easily visible.
Room Tip: Choose a room that is not on the highway side.

I needed a hotel on the north side of Las Vegas preferably near highway 95, which I needed to take the following morning. Furthermore, the hotel was part of the Hilton Honors program of which I am a member, so the stay counted towards my points. The complimentary breakfast was better than many hotel complimentary breakfasts and had hot items to choose amongst.</p><br>Great Visit<p>We spent five nights in February. Our preacher was here to preach a revival so we were not interested in any gambling facilities. This hotel is very family oriented. It was quiet and had a very good breakfast. The personnel behind the desk were very nice and accommodating. Our room was always nicely cleaned. Comfortable bed and great pillows. They also have complimentary cookies and bottled water. We stayed here last February for the same reason. I would stay here again if the opportunity were to arise.</p><br>Great Stay<p>Stayed one night while in the area. Digital check in only gave me one room option right behind the front desk, I was able to check in but not choose a room. We arrived at the hotel and Gabby at the front desk was great. Room was right across from the elevators but quiet. The crib I requested was brought to the room before we got the elevator. Breakfast was very good and well stocked with a nice selection (pre-made cheese omelets, sliced smoked sausage, biscuits & gravy, etc). Lots to eat close by and the front desk has menus of restaurants in the area that deliver to the hotel. Comfortable beds, clean room and lots of hot water. Hotel is off the main road so be sure to watch for the turn off street.</p><br>Hampton Inn Summerlin Nevada<p>Was there a week for training. Chose this location because it was close to training facility and had a govt discount, reasonable rates. I have no negative comments about my stay. The accommodations were great.</p><br>Great Experience<p>Lobby was nice and well appointed. Digital check-in allowed me to pick my room. Room was quiet and as advertised but I could have used a more comfortable sitting chair instead of a straight back chair. Room was clean and bed was comfortable. Everything worked. Staff was friendly and helpful. Good breakfast items.</p><br>Hampton Las Vegas<p>Very friendly and helpful staff. Nice hotel, well kept. Location was central to visiting with family members living in Las Vegas. Breakfast was well stocked and actually had good food. You could even make your own waffles. The hotel was full of families in town for a soccer tournament but the staff handled all of those people very efficiently. Great little pub across the street offering a great burger and ton of choices for beer.</p><br>Non-Smoking and No Breakfast<p>Hampton is usually very good about staying ahead of these issues, but this weekend they were unable to provide a non-smoking room and they could not stay ahead of the breakfast crowd. I would still recommend this hotel because the STAFF is very friendly and they are doing the best they can do.</p><br>Good sleep at a fair price<p>Located conveniently off US95 in the northwest valley. Check-in was smooth. Parking was ample. The room was clean and bed comfortable. Outside noise was minimal. Breakfast was tasty with a good assortment of hot & cold offerings and fresh fruit. We were given a late check out which afforded us the chance to lounge around a bit without rushing. A lot of restaurants and shopping in the area as well as medical services. No airport or strip shuttle.
Room Tip: Pick a room away from the freeway side.

It is nice to be able to go visit the action and then retreat to your quiet, safe hotel in which is located right next to freeway access. I will be visiting again!</p><br></body></html>
