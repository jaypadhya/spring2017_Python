<html><head><h3>Hampton Inn Las Vegas/Summerlin Hotel Reviews Page 32</h3></head><body><br>Horrible experience<p>I booked a room here for an extended stay based on the reviews and its proximity to my workplace. I was also told by the manager over the phone that there would be a complimentary manager's special dinner every Monday of my multi-month stay. However, after the first dinner, the manager decided that the hotel wasn't occupied to level needed to justify a dinner every Monday. The front desk staff was probably the worst I've ever encountered. Rude, short, and unapologetic when the business center printer wouldn't work, the housekeeping staff failed to show up and when I was placed in a wheel-chair accessible room despite my request for a normal room (I'm 6'2'' and the lower sinks don't work for me). Also, don't take more than one complimentary cookie from the front desk, or you will get a glare from the receptionist. The room was small, uncomfortable, a little grungy and had an over-powering smell of chemicals--I actually got used to it, but it was so strong that one of my co-workers could smell it on my suit in the morning. I checked out early after only 4 nights and I will not be returning to this location despite my Hilton Honors affiliation...ever.</p><br>Great place to spend a day or many days<p>If you are looking for a great hotel off the strip this is a nice property. We were amazed when we got to the room. The king size bed was amazing. I think it was a california king it was so big. The furniture and bedding was beautiful. The room was huge. It had a kitchen that was totally modern and nice sitting room with couch and coffee table. The tv was a flat screen and rotated to wherever you wanted to sit. It had a separate vanity with double sinks. The toilet and shower were separate and totally updated. We were on the 3rd floor and it was quiet. It had a nice huge desk with all the ports for you computer. The room was clean, smelt good and had a huge closet. I needed to do laundry and the hotel provided me with the detergent and even dryer sheets for free. The buffet in the morning was excellent. Waffles, eggs , sausage, fruit and all the beverages you would need or want. I would definately stay at this hotel again if we are ever in Vegas again. Alot of resturants are close by and you are very close to the Vegas strip. It is an excellent room for the price and the staff are very helpful and friendly.
Room Tip: If you want to stay off the strip this is a good choice.

Room was typical Hampton quality which is one reason we always choose them, they meet our needs. Breakfast was excellent with a good variety available and plenty of it! The location is close to markets, dining and gambling if you need any of those.</p><br>Location and Room worked well for us.<p>We were traveling from Death Valley and had the misfortune of having to find a room on the Saturday night during Halloween weekend around Las Vegas where reasonably priced rooms seemed all sold out. We got into this Hampton with our Hilton points and found it to be a very nice hotel with a very comfortable and practically arranged room and a good breakfast.
Our only negative experience was with the check-in clerk with whom we had to negotiate far too long to get the right room for us.
We are very familiar with the Summerlin area and this is indeed a great location to get anywhere in and around Las Vegas.</p><br>Nice Hotel...Not Great<p>This is a 5 year+ old Hampton Inn hotel just 10 minutes from the Strip. It is not a fantastic hotel, but nice. The room was large, comfortable, and served its purpose for our one night stay. However, the bathroom really needs to be updated! It appears much older than the year of the hotel. The breakfast was great; the waffles were tasty. The staff were very helpful. We'd probably stay at a different hotel the next time we're looking for a hotel off the strip.</p><br>Great option while visiting Nellis AFB<p>We stayed in the Hampton Inn Las Vegas - Summerlin for four days while we were visiting our son and his family who are stationed at Nellis AFB. The Hampton Inn nearest Nellis was full so we switched to the Hampton - Summerlin. It's actually convienent to and from Nellis AFB as you just have to travel back and forth Craig Rd (it's approximately 20 minutes from the Base). The hardest part we had was initially finding it, as the hotel has no large sign to point highlight its location (probably a zoning law as its near a housing area). You can see it from the 95 if you come up from the south. You can easily see the La Quinta sign and the Hampton is next to it, tucked about a block off of Tenaya behind a medical complex.

Like all Hamptons, the hotel was clean, the staff friendly and helpful, wireless internet, and the breakfast never ending.

It's also a very nice location away from the strip if you don't want to stay downtown.
Room Tip: There are smoking rooms in the hotel so be sure you select a non smoking room if desired when making...

The hotel is located in the Summerlin area of Las Vegas, not near the strip or casinos, but in a very nice residential area. We stay in Hampton Inns a lot, and we must say that this is the nicest of all of them. The hotel is either very new, or has been remodeled recently, or is just kept unbelievably clean --- in any event, it is really a beautiful, spotless hotel. The staff knew about the death, and were unbelievably kind. They seemed really concerned, and went out of their way to be nice, helpful, and attentive.

On to the more mundane: Their breakfasts, while always good at Hampton Inns, were especially good. They had a very sweet young woman who "ran" the breakfasts, and she was friendly, always asking if we wanted more of anything, cleaning everything immediately, She was extra sweet, and wanted to note that. In some ways, it felt more like a very nice little "cafe" than the breakfast at a hotel! Also, again a small thing, but they always had warm, fresh cookies at night and, if we came in late and they were out, the staff at the desk always offered to make more right away. We stayed at a Hampton in LA the next week, and the staff their could not be bothered to do this little thing.

So, the property is beautiful, the staff unbelievably attentive and kind, the rooms larger than most Hamptons, and the value was superb. We would really suggest that if you want a different Las Vegas experience, away from the casinos and the fast pace, you should consider staying here. MUCH nicer than a typical Vegas hotel. Oh, and the internet is free! (at the casino hotels, they add on a $15 a night charge for internet, and a "resort fee" of anything from $5 to $20).

Great hotel... and thanks to them, again, for being so kind during our grieving time...</p><br>Outstanding value and cleanliness<p>Stayed three nights (Thurs-Sun.) This is an outstanding choice if you are visiting Vegas for business and have no desire to be near the tackiness and traffic of The Strip.

The hotel is located in a very quiet and safe area next to a hospital. The immediate area is professional offices for doctors/dentists, etc, and another hotel next door. As others have stated, US Hwy 95 runs along the backside of the hotel. Some of the rooms will have very light-light highway noise as a result, but other rooms face away to the front of the property and will not have any noise at all. There is plenty of shopping in the area a short drive away.

The hotel itself is clean and well-kept. We were greeted warmly at check-in. Cookies are provided in the evenings, and there is a Manager's reception on Tuesday nights.
Room was very clean and everything worked properly. The fitness center, business center, and pool were in good condition. Free passes to a local Gold's Gym are available if you wish to work out off site. Breakfast is standard Hampton fare and the breakfast bar was well-stocked. I was also pleased to see it runs until 10:00 am, which is later than other properties I've stayed at.

All in all it was an excellent property and an extremely reasonable room rate for a Vegas weekend. I'll continue to come back.
Room Tip: Ask for a room facing the front of the hotel property.

It was only 25 minutes from downtown, in a hospital district, but it was a blessed relief to be so far from traffic and tawdriness of The Strip. Even though U.S. 95 is right outside the back door, there was virtually no noise. Otherwise, it was a standard-issue Hampton Inn: clean, comfortable, friendly, reasonably priced, and unimaginative in its decor.

Big pluses: An outdoor hot tub, and a Whole Foods about a mile away.

Small minus: The management seems to be deaf to noise in the lobby and breakfast area. A loud TV plays right next to the loud music system. It drives the desk clerks crazy, but they told me that they are not allowed to turn off one or the other. At breakfast time, you might consider eating in your room.</p><br>Clean, peaceful, quiet stay.<p>Very nice 3-story hotel. Had a quiet, clean room. No freeway noise. Awesome hot breakfast every morning. Little cheese turnover omelets, seasoned diced potatoes, donuts, yogurt, cold cereal, instant oatmeal, fresh hot waffles, hard boiled eggs, bananas, apples, oranges, pastries.. great buffet. Hot tea, hot chocolate & fresh coffee 24/7. Vending machines. Chips & bottled water in room. Sack breakfast to go at front desk mon-fri bottled water, muffin, fresh fruit, granola bar & mints.</p><br></body></html>
