<html><head><h3>Hampton Inn Las Vegas/Summerlin Hotel Reviews Page 28</h3></head><body><br>Great sleep<p>I travel to Vegas for work quite often. I've stayed at the hotel across the way and have to say, I always return to The Hampton Inn because their beds are the best. It's so clean, nice, very updated. I always know I will have a good nights rest here. The breakfast is good, the staff is great. It's easy access to the freeway. Love it here.</p><br>10min to the Strip<p>We stayed here because ob the strip and off Strip everything was booked out in fact of Memorial Day. It was a Good Choice! Nice staff, free wifi, Free parking, Nice room and a really Good hot breakfast!
If you have a Car, stay here!</p><br>Wonderful stay; I can't wait to come back!!<p>Normally I don't like Las Vegas, so it was nice to get away from all the reasons I don't like the city. I really enjoyed the hospitality and the quality I received while staying there. This was definitely the best Hampton I've stayed at. We came for a soccer tournament and couldn't have asked for better accommodations. The pitch was 5 minutes away and the desk clerks wished us well every day. It must have worked because our girls won the championship! Next year I'll call early and suggest we make this our club hotel for future trips. Thank you all for a wonderful stay!!! It was so clean. Breakfast was good and the hours were convenient. We really enjoyed the coffee, cookies and hot chocolate at the end of the day.</p><br>Best Hotel Yet on our Cross Country Road Trip<p>We wanted to be on the west end of Las Vegas to visit Red Rock Canyon, and not in a casino hotel, and the Hampton Inn filled the bill very nicely. This hotel was the nicest we experienced so far in our trip across the US: From the double automatic lobby doors, to elevator access to upper floors, to the superior complimentary breakfast, to the freshly cleaned duvets and comfortable beds, to the recessed hallway lighting and doors that gently closed, to the better-than-average business center and exercise room, the hotel and its services were very well thought out and executed. If one were considering relative value, I think the hotel would deserve an outstanding rating.</p><br>Easy stay<p>Very clean, very fast, no hassle, no problems, very nice and very quiet. The service was very good and the breakfast made the mornings even easier. The staff was wonderful and the access to 95 was very easy as well. What can I say - it was easy.</p><br>Great value<p>Used AAA and got this hotel for $100 including taxes. Off the strip and quiet with helpful staff. Quick access to freeway - great for people passing through town. Not the place for people who want the "Vegas" experience.</p><br>Nice Hotel but Poor WiFi<p>Overall this hotel is a good place to stay. Nice and clean hotel with nice amenities. Some front office staff are friendlier than others. My biggest gripe though is that I could not get any wifi connection from either on the first or third floors. This may not be an issue for most, but unfortunately this is something important to me and would make me consider other hotels nearby.</p><br>Local staycation<p>Needed a nice place for one night in Summerlin to avoid a long drive back across town - this place fit the bill! Clean, comfortable, quiet and convenient. I would recommend for friends and family to stay if they are visiting you in LV.</p><br>Noisy mechanics<p>My husband and I stayed one night there. His company had booked us for three. He was there for business and we had tacked on an extra night so we could see the sights. The facilities are fine. However at night our room was plagued by a noise and vibration from what sounded like a constantly running refrigeration unit. Our best guess was that it was the whole hotel A/C unit, as it was not the unit from our room. We even unplugged the refrigerator in our room, but that didn't help. In the morning we went to the front desk, explained the situation and asked to be moved. The front desk, while listening politely said all they could offer was the room in the exact location on the floor above. They initially acted like nobody had ever noticed the noise before but then agreed that they had heard this before. I believe our room was 220, an oversized king room. I have stayed at many Hampton Inns before and never run into this. There was no way we were staying for another sleepless night. But what surprised me was that the front desk made no mention of the usual Hampton Inn policy that if you are not satisfied they will make it right! They cheerfully accepted our decision to check out, charged our card and sent us on our way! We then lost some of our leisure time finding another hotel for the next two nights. I would never recommend you stay there without first going to your room, listening carefully and even laying down on the bed to see if the whole thing shakes! Go to the Hampton Inn by the airport instead! We ended up there, or the Homewood Suites. Both are much nicer. And even though closer to the airport, the planes don't run all night, which isn't true of whatever made that noise we suffered through!</p><br>A Trip At Summerlin<p>Nice hotel, very clean, very good setup of the lobby however the breakfast nook seems to be cramped in space and the TV location is awkward since it disturb TV viewing by the passersby.
Laundry is very tricky since there are 2 options but only one slot for coins. Aside from these, parking is great, room cleaners are good in keeping your room clean all the time, 24/7 coffee pot is awesome and
Room Tip: If you will do laundry get the 2nd floor and room at the rear end starting at 240, rear end parking...
