<html><head><h3>Hampton Inn Las Vegas/Summerlin Hotel Reviews Page 30</h3></head><body><br>Well done, top to bottom<p>we were delighted to find this quiet, clean, friendly hotel. Beds were great, everything thoroughly clean and breakfast very good for a hotel. REAL EGGS!! They even have a little lunch sack at check out that includes a muffin, a breakfast bar, water & some mints. We'd stay again if we ever go through Vegas.</p><br>Great hotel off the Strip<p>I stayed here for the first part of my Las Vegas trip - the "non-gambling part". The hotel is very nice. Rooms were modern and clean. The staff were friendly and helpful. The pool area and spa/hot tub were clean and tidy. The water was a litte cold in the pool though. There is no real excuse for this as there are many solar powered water heaters on the market which would provide the hotel with free hot water for the pool - lets face it Vegas is very sunny!
Breakfast was good but was never that hot, more warm but the selection was good and changed daily. The help-yourself coffee on the go in the lobby is a nice touch - far easier than using the in-room facilities for a single cup. Microwave and fridge in the room are handy. Coin opperated laundry handy for longer stays like mine. Good connections to the main roads/highways.
Downpoints - Highway 95 is at the back of the hotel so there was traffic noise. Not so bad in the day but got a little annoying at times during the night. Water pressure a little low. I'm not sure if this is intentional to save water or if its a genuine problem. There was copious amounts of hot water though. The free in-room wi-fi was slow - less than 0.5mbps. It was fine for surfing but horrible when I was trying to catch up on some sport online.
On the whole though I was impressed. I perhaps wouldn't pay full rates for the rooms (I get a discount from Hilton group who owns the hotel through a family member.) But for what I did pay I was happy.
Room Tip: My side of the hotel generally faced the Highway. Id say the NE corner would be quieter but not sure...

Room had microwave, fridge, sink, little kitchenette type area. Breakfast was good. Scrambled eggs with diced ham & cheese, biscuits and gravy, bacon, waffles, yogurt, oatmeal, cold cereal, etc. Monday night football, they have munchies with the tv's going. They also have a drop down screen in their meeting room if you want to watch the game in there. Staff is very nice. This was just a clean and relaxing stay. Definately will stay again.</p><br>If you don't mind some distance from the Strip, this is a great place!<p>Tucked away in a quiet area in the northwest Las Vegas area, this hotel was modern and clean, and the staff was friendly and helpful. A number of restaurants and grocery/retail stores just a short drive away. The Strip is about a 15-20 minute drive away and is not easily reached by public transportation, so if you plan to spend the majority of your time in the casinos, this may not be the hotel for you. If you are in town for business or want to explore the surrounding area, however, this is a very nice choice.</p><br>Excellent stay!<p>Me and three girlfriends had an excellent stay at the Summerlin location. The hotel had everything we wanted, grest service, clean, smimming pool, frig/micro, and far but not too far from the strip. The amazing continental breakfast was a bonus. Coffee all, WOW! We lounged during the day at our excellent accomidations and went to the strip to party. The hotel was quiet and no young stupid drunk people. An no heavy smoking smell. I will be returning in a few months!!
Room Tip: Bring your own beach towels to cover the loung chairs, theres were small.
See more room tips</p><br>Very nice hotel<p>The front desk staff is very friendly and helpful. Room was very clean and everything worked. Breakfast buffet better than most other Hamptons. Furniture in the room was comfortable and in good shape. I had a view of the outdoor pool from my room and it looked very inviting, though I didn't have time to partake. Very pleased with this hotel.</p><br>This hotel rocks!<p>My husband and I stayed at this hotel due to his father passing away after a long illness, and we wanted to stay at a Hampton Inn. We've stayed at the one in Sandy, UT earlier in the year, and it was very nice.

The staff was always friendly, there was a very nice gentleman who carted our luggage up to our room for us, because both of us are semi-disabled and unable to utilize the huge brass luggage cart on our own. He was cheerful, kind and remembered us when we would see him while we stayed there. The cookies were a nice treat in the evenings.

The desk staff were so friendly and sympathetic when we told them the purpose for our stay. They didn't ask...we volunteered the information. Each evening when we returned, they would ask how the day went. This was especially nice on the day of the funeral, when emotions were running high and we had been through the worst part of the stay.

The Tuesday night dinner was a nice touch and we enjoyed the food very much. The breakfast in the morning offered a good variety of food and lots of it. Not that we made pigs of ourselves, mind you. :) The kitchen staff was always friendly and helpful; we both walk with canes...they would carry our trays to our table when we asked, which I think was maybe once or twice. The dining area was clean and very nice.

The room was wonderful! It was twice the size of our bedroom at home and we felt very spoiled. It was the semi-handicapped room with the lighted alerts for the phone and door, which was good because my husband is hard of hearing. The bathroom was outfitted with a tub with the nice curved shower rod and the bars to hang on to. It was nice having a microwave and fridge if we needed them. We used the fridge, but didn't get to use the microwave. The bed was very comfortable; it was hard to get up in the morning! The room had a chest looking bench next to the dresser that the TV was on and we stored our luggage on it, we wish that it had storage capabilities inside of it. We did have enough storage space for our items. Overall, we had a lovely stay and would definately stay here again.

This hotel is away from the strip and in the middle of a medical park and would be suitable for families, so it's quiet and pleasant. We truly enjoyed our time here despite the circumstances.</p><br>Very comfortable<p>Really nice property! Clean, comfortable, with an easily accessed business center.</p><br>A slice of home in the midst of craziness<p>We needed a place to stay that was quiet, peaceful, relaxing, smoke-free, and no gambling in the lobby. This was the place! Even though its in the Summerlin area, the Strip is not too far away. It had a microwave and good size refrigerator which is perfect for our family of 5. The Breakfast was good and plentiful. The baked cookies at night in the lobby were a nice touch. Best of all, the room key served as a free pass to the local Gold's Gym, which was only a few blocks away and open 24/7.</p><br>Great staff, clean hotel<p>Can't say enough about the staff at this Hampton Hotel. We stayed there 3 nights with a softball team. Our rooms were ready upon our arrival and they even accommodated our request to be on the same floor with 2 rooms connecting. Anthony was especially helpful with suggestions for area restaurants and even made cookies for us one afternoon. The rooms were very clean and well equipped. The beds are very comfortable. The location was great, away from The Strip but close enough to I15 and 215 that we could get to our destinations easily. I would recommend if you are looking for a nice quiet clean hotel away from The Strip, this is it. It was also close to grocery stores, Target and several restaurants. The breakfast had a good variety and the dining area was clean and comfortable. We would definitely go back again.</p><br></body></html>
