<html><head><h3>Hampton Inn Las Vegas/Summerlin Hotel Reviews Page 6</h3></head><body><br>SO MUCH TRAFFIC NOISE<p>We stay at various Hilton Hotels a lot, as Hilton Honors members. Needed to stay one night. The place was okay, but even though I asked about room location, we were placed right at the end of the hall, nearest to US 95, a major highway. So, we basically got little or no sleep due to very, very loud levels of traffic noise.
And, the hotel property itself is hard to find, on a little side street, behind medical buildings.
We would never, ever stay here again as we prefer to sleep at night!</p><br>Not as good as it used to be<p>We last visited this hotel 9'years ago and my how it has gone downhill. It is showing its age in all aspects. Returned here only because of our last visit. Furnishings in rooms and carpets are dirty and in dire need of cleaning. The nearby neighborhood has also declined. The front desk staff was friendly and helpful but the hotel is what it is.</p><br>Great Alternative to the Bigger Resorts<p>Stayed a couple days during the summer for a family wedding and A/C worked great. Would recommend if you'd prefer not to stay at the larger resorts. Lobby seemed to have a recent renovation/upgrade, but the hallways and rooms fall a bit short.</p><br>exceptional comfort<p>Greeting on arrival courteous, efficient room designation with offer of cold or room temperature bottled water to go, cleanliness exceptional with refrigerator and microwave both in excellent working order - ready to use - lovely large windows, safe feeling.</p><br>RACIST HOTEL STAY AWAY EVEN THE GM IS RUDE<p>Wow what a place I wouldn't share this hotel with my worse enemy. I walk in at 3am the guest service agent Elaine was helping a Caucasian male she was really polite and courteous to him once he left she started doing paper work like I wasn't standing there once 5-7 mins went by I said hello she stated oh your still standing there .... Like FORREAL are you serious I would like to check in she said oh ok and started laughing . After we check in we go upstairs the room smelled smokey we called to the front desk she said we are sold out I can't switch your rooms and hung up in my face . We went down the next morning the girl at the front desk didn't even help all she said was talk to a manger no one was trying to help we called for towels it took 30 mins to bring them up . The beds are hard as a work my daughter could not sleep at all . Once I returned home I thought let me give the Gm a call that was a bad idea he let me talk for two mins then. He transferred me to a women that did her best to try to help but passing the call WHAT GM DOES THAT he just showed he could care less on what guest has to say I'm trying to reach the owner of the hotel at this point they need to change the name to RACIST HOTEL WE JUST DONT CARE AND THE GM IS THE LEADER I wouldn't stay here again if they paid me</p><br>Stayed for the weekend<p>My husband travels for work and has never had a problem staying at Hampton Inn. This weekend getaway we decided to stay at the Las Vegas location for a nearby wedding. When we checked in Judy at the front desk was simply delightful. She was accommodating and friendly. I'm 7 1/2 months pregnant, fat and uncomfortable and Judy put a smile on my face. The room was clean and comfortable. Breakfast was crowded but the servers were working hard to keep everything stocked.

My only complaint is that the hallway was hot. Every time we left the room I was sweating by the time I reached the lobby.</p><br>nice hotel<p>staff was friendly and accomodating. Hotel was clean and well maintained. Not too far from restaurants etc. but a bit of a walk if you don't have a vehicle. Several restaurants deliver in the area though.</p><br>Great place and great receptionist <p>We decide to visit Las Vegas, but we won't sleep inside the strip so Hampton Inn is the greatest one on tripadvisor! So I confirm all the reviews! Cheap, clean, quite and breakfast is included too! U can eat a great and huge continental breakfast!</p><br>Attend grandson's bithday<p>We had a very enjoyable stay at this hotel and would recommend it to other travelers. Rooms were great and breakfast offered a good variety. Staff were very nice. If you like cookies, they are available around 7 pm each night.</p><br>Once found, very good<p>The motel was very pleasant and served our visit to family quite well. The only difficulty was in location. It is behind a number of taller buildings in a medical center area and there is no obvious signage on the main road. We came in with a late check in, driving in a strange area, late at night. We called the desk on our cells and she talked us into the right location, being very, very helpful.</p><br></body></html>
