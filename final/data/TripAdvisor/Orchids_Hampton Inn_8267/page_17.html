<html><head><h3>Hampton Inn Las Vegas/Summerlin Hotel Reviews Page 17</h3></head><body><br>Great hotel far off the strip<p>If you are looking for a hotel for a "Vegas experience", then this is not the hotel for you. If not, then this IS the hotel for you! Easy highway access, clean, great rooms, clean, amazing staff, clean, and clean. What do you want in a hotel? Cleanliness, safety, and service.. You will get them all here!</p><br>Good hotel, location not so much<p>We stayed at this hotel in May and although the location is not the best if you intend to have the full Vegas experience, it's actually quite convenient if you'd like to have a more realistic taste of what living in Vegas is like. Also great for shopping and exploring the area if you've got a car. The hotel itself is well-run, breakfast is plentiful and varied and front desk staff is generally very helpful and nice. Good memories of those 10 days!</p><br>WONDERFUL!<p>Sparkling clean. Everything looked like new. Bath was immaculate and stocked with quality products. Beds were clean and comfy. Nice amenities like free in-room WiFi and usb plugs on the lamps. No more searching for enough outlets to charge our phones. Free breakfast was fantastic. Hot egg dishes, yummy waffles, biscuits & gravy, danish, muffins, fruit, even hard-boiled eggs. Customer service was outstanding throughout our stay. It's a 10 min drive to the strip, but in a newer area that was very quiet.We've paid a lot more for hotels that didn't come close to the quality of this one.</p><br>Nice hotel-Good price<p>I was able to book, online, 2 rooms a week before arrival. When I called the hotel asking for adjoining rooms, they told me they were too booked to change things. When I arrived, to my surprise, I had adjoining rooms!! My room was right across from the elevator and I heard no noise from that or my family, in adjoining room, through the walls. Is well insulated The staff was very accomodating, friendly and efficient. Rooms were clean, spacious, and had micro/refridge on top of the regular ammenetities. Pool and pool area was kept clean, water crystal clear and a comfortable temp. Only one disappointment was they had no rooms with 2 queen sized beds, so we settled for 2 rooms with 2 doubles in each (4 women). Was comfortable enough. Hotel is located a few miles away from Vegas strip, but close enough to get to easily.</p><br>Hampton Inn<p>As usual, Hampton Inns are always one of my first choices. They are clean, comfortable, and convenient. The staff is well trained. The bed quality is great. The breakfasts are more than sweet rolls and coffee. You can always find something healthy, too.</p><br>Family Stay for Sporting Event<p>Our family needed a room for a few days while one child attended a high school sporting event. Good value for the money, room was clean and neat every day, staff friendly and helpful. If you are looking for a non-casino stay with free breakfast in north/central Las Vegas, this is a great option!</p><br>Would stay again<p>Loved the stay there!! Friendly staff, clean room, comfortable beds, and they had refrigerator and microwave in the room. They also had multiple outlets with usb ports for charging the many portable electronics everyone carries these days. Excellent stay and we would do it again!!</p><br>Another great stay<p>When I'm in Vegas for work, this is what I want. It is clean, quiet, with hot food ready in the morning. I'm a simple man with simple needs when it comes to a hotel and they nail them all. On top of all of that the staff is always friendly.
Room Tip: The 4th floor is nice and quiet

Great value! I wish other hotels were as good a value! I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone traveling in Las Vegas area.</p><br>Nice cheap option<p>After a week of visiting the Grand Canyon and Zion, we were looking for a cheap option in Vegas before our flight home the next day and chose this hotel. The area around it is quite nice and the hotel itself was great. We even visited the outdoor pool and hot tub which was also quite nice.

Room was clean and up to Hampton standards. Lots of food options nearby and it wasn't too far to drive in the morning to visit the strip and head back to the airport.</p><br></body></html>
