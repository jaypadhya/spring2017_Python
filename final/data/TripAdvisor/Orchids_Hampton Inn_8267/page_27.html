<html><head><h3>Hampton Inn Las Vegas/Summerlin Hotel Reviews Page 27</h3></head><body><br>Great value for the money!<p>From the daily complimentary breakfast that included fresh fruit, cereals, yogurts, donoughts, eggs, etc., to the daily snacks, clean exercise room, complimentary business room with access to printers, this hotel was a wonderful value. The service was exceptional - we were always greeted with a friendly smile, and no request was every annoying to the staff!</p><br>Clean, comfortable rooms. Friendly staff!<p>We stayed one night at this hotel and have nothing but positive things to say about it! The staff was very friendly, our room was clean and comfortable, and the location was quiet. I would absolutely stay here again!</p><br>Fantastic Hotel and Front Desk!!!<p>The best.....wonderlul clean rooms with great beds, spotless. The whole property was top notch, as soon as you walked thru the door you could tell how well it was kept up, I will go back to this Hampton in a second Stephani at the front desk really helped me out!!!</p><br>travelling with groups from New Zealand<p>LOVED this hotel - front service staff made this hotel so enjoyable.
We came with 20 people in August 2012 (5 rooms) and have a smaller group returning this year of 12 people.
Rooms are clean comfortable and quiet. Free wifi is a godsend to communicate with families back home!
Housekeeping are friendly and super helpful with our needed showers at random times due to training and competition schedule.
Breakfasts being included is one of the highlights - as is the pool and little 'shop' with the basics and drinks!</p><br>Excellent<p>Just passing through LV, and picked this hotel based on our experience of the Hampton Inn Gallup-West.

Good service, good room and a good price. With 117 deg F the outside pool was a welcome surprise.</p><br>Better than staying on the strip<p>I recently stayed here for a business trip. I was supposed to stay at one of the Station hotels but it was booked. This hotel was about 10 minutes from where our meeting was located. The check in process was easy. The room was excellent. The fitness center was great. Coffee available all day. The complimentary breakfast was good as well. I'm not a big fan of the strip hotels. This hotel was perfect for me. I will stay here again.</p><br>great place<p>Quiet beautiful location close to our friends home in Summerlin. I would never have thought there are hotels so close to the strip that would have none of the noise or smoke if I had not searched the internet for the specific city I was interested in visiting. This was a perfect location. I will definitely stay here again.</p><br>Decent hotel that serves the purpose<p>If you are probably staying in this hotel means most likely for work like me. I stayed here for 3 nights while on business trip. Has all the basic facilities of a Hampton hotel. Gym is bit small. Got a nice small pool. Well secured and not noisy even though right next to freeway. Break is perfect and available from 5 AM to 10 AM. Overall a nice, clean and quiet hotel.</p><br>Nice Hotel, Typical Hampton Inn<p>Pretty typical for a Hampton Inn property. The rooms are ample and nice, breakfast is very good, staff is friendly, and the location is quiet. We had a problem with housekeeping after the first night, as the room was not made up, even though it was available to be serviced (we were out) except for a 2 hour period in the afternoon, and even though we called it to the front desk's attention at 4PM that the room was unmade. In the room the "computer desk" is either too high, or the chair (telescoping chair) too low, as working was uncomfortable.</p><br>great service<p>Wonderful , small hotel in a quiet section of Las Vegas. Great service, friendly staff. No smell of smoke and no loud music or guests as one usually finds in Las Vegas hotels. Perfect retreat for business or pleasure in the area.</p><br></body></html>
