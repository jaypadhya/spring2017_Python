<html><head><h3>Hampton Inn Las Vegas/Summerlin Hotel Reviews Page 24</h3></head><body><br>Great Hotel<p>Clean, comfortable beds, amazing breakfast.. Why TripAdvisor makes me write a minimum 200 characters is beyond me. Quite Annoying really. Now i'm running a blank to write more characters. OK this is the fifth time I've hit submit.</p><br>Good for the price<p>A little noisy with the highway next door, the card reader we had kept malfunctioning (couldn't get in room or side door a few times) and breakfast ends too soon (they seemed to let everything run out at the end). Other than these things, it wasn't a bad place to stay...just not great!</p><br>Not the best this time<p>A broken elevator, with our room being on the 3rd floor, presented inconveniences. We have a daughter that lives near the Hampton Inn so we would like to stay again. The elevator was broken when we came in on Christmas evening and we were told it would be repaired by morning. It wasn't. We are both in our 70's and one trip up the stairs is ok but 2-3 in the morning was more than we bargained, or paid for.</p><br>Hampton Disappointment<p>Hotel room plumbing smelled like sewer and elevator malfunctioned several times during stay. Needs attention. We generally like Hampton Inn's for their value and reasonable breakfast. This location simply didn't meet the Hampton standard. If repaired, it will be a decent place to stay.</p><br>Best quality and value for the money<p>This Hampton property in Las Vegas/Summerlin is an excellent choice - the staff is always friendly and responsive to requests. Rooms are clean, spacious and have the right amenities. A VERY complete breakfast is provided each day. The price (we paid $89/night) is a tremendous bargain. Highly recommend this Hampton Inn.</p><br>Business travel<p>I'd been staying at a hotel near the strip, but it was noisy, difficult to get in and out of due to strip activity, and they charged for internetâ€¦. so I had my assistant search for a new hotel and Hampton Inn is what she found. I really like it - much nicer than the other - quiet, clean, well maintained, nice fitness center and free internet access and free breakfast and coffee all day long. It was a pleasure to stay there.</p><br>second visit to this Hampton Inn location.<p>Staff friendly and remembered us,,,, hotel was busy on our affrival....put us up in suite with 2 twin beds, very uncomforable.....after first weekend and the hotel was empty....never offed upgrade to Queen or King size bed?</p><br>Business Trip<p>My first time on a business trip to Las Vegas and staying away from the strip. The Hampton is located in a well populated area with many business around for shopping and dining. I felt very safe in the hotel and the staff was excellent! The room was very clean and comfortable.</p><br>Nice launching point for working at NTS<p>This hotel is near the north edge of Las Vegas, so a nice launching point for working at NTS. It's about an hour to Mercury. The hot breakfast opens at 5 AM to accommodate people working/traveling on an early schedule.

The hotel and room were nicely appointed and in good condition. Fridge and microwave in room. The front desk staff was friendly. The small fitness center had 3 cardio machines, weights and a physical therapy ball (often missing from hotel fitness centers), so suited my needs.

I still can't figure out the Hampton Inn's lumpy doonas. I commented on it at a Hampton Inn in Maryland, because I thought it had been damaged in the wash. They told me they were all that way, and I guess they were right, nationwide. I guess it's a style thing.
Room Tip: rooms facing north catch a view of the mountains to the west
