Great friendly staff all around..Would stay here again</p><br>Hampton Inn Cascade Drive Summerlin<p>The hotel lobby is nice however the rooms are dated and the carpeting is in need of repair or cleaning. Beds are not very comfortable. The breakfast is your standard continental or microwaved entrees included with your stay.</p><br>Excellent choice for North Las Vegas<p>Went to Las Vegas for a retirement ceremony and were looking for a place to stay not far from family. Reviews for the Hampton Inn were pretty good, so we booked our room.
Overall, this was a good place to stay-- not too big or flashy, but a comfortable room, easy parking, good breakfast, and good value.
Don't stay here is you want the excitement of the Strip or Casinos-- the hotel is in a pretty quiet area, but not far from the freeway, so it was a pretty easy jump to nearly everywhere else in Vegas.
Parking was extremely easy and the rooms were nice, clean, and fresh. Breakfast was included and was a pleasant surprise, with lots of choices.
The bed was very comfortable-- took note of the mattress brand for future reference!
Only downsides were restaurants (nothing close by) and signage-- the hotel is a bit tough to spot from the freeway and nearly impossible to see from Tenaya Street (the main street past it). We finally figured out that the visible landmark to use was the La Quinta sign that stuck above the rest of the buildings around it-- it would help if they would put a sign on Tenaya pointing to the hotel.</p><br>Insects in bathroom<p>Nice enough hotel, though a little close to freeway, resulting in some road noise. Main issue was insects in bathroom. I killed one large cockroach and saw numerous ants. The remainder of the hotel seemed clean enough. The breakfast was good.</p><br>Great Business Trip Hotel<p>Was in town on Business, this hotel had rooms available at/below the per diem rate, even with our check in date being the day after the big fight in Vegas. The lobby has been recently remodeled and all of the rooms and areas were clean and in good repair. The Breakfast was always really great, a good variety of pre-made omelets and fruit, and of course, the waffle maker! The hotel had good and quick access to 95, which was the main route we used to get to/from our business destination. 15 min from the airport/downtown depending on traffic. There is a great 24/7 bar across the street called Aces & Ales. If you're a craft beer fan then this is your place, over 50 on tap with almost the same amount in bottles too. Not the place if you're looking for Bud Light, Miller Light, etc. There is a target and gas stations near by as well, for anything that you might need. Maybe not the best spot if you're in town to see & do "vegas" and the s trip, as you'll be commuting or racking up a helluva cab bill, but great for business or the out of town traveler who doesn't mind being away from the hustle and bustle of downtown.</p><br>A quiet surprise<p>We stayed out in Summerlin for one night because Las Vegas was overbooked with a fight. While we did move to the strip the next day, our stay at the Summerlin Hampton Inn was quiet, only ten minutes away from the hustle and bustle, was clean and well managed facility. It was also surrounded by a lot of medical facilities if one needed that. Nice location and the beds were comfortable.</p><br>Terrific!<p>great location, clean, beautiful, no problems at all...wish we could have stayed longer to take advantage of the great amenities! We both would like to come back just for this hotel...easy access to everything...</p><br>Summerlin Hampton<p>Great hotel, better price! I almost always stay with Hampton when I travel; they consistently meet/exceed my expectations for the price range. The hotel is a little off the main path, but in a nice quite area.</p><br>Very Good Value for the Money<p>The hotel staff was very courteous and helpful. The room was clean throughout. With complimentary hot breakfast, it was a very good value for the money. The hotel is approximately 8 miles from the Las Vegas Strip</p><br>Good location / staff / service<p>Usually staying with family, this was the first time using a hotel in Las Vegas. Room was good. Service was friendly and prompt. The breakfast area was in constant use and workers always had more food and coffee available. Outside pool area was clean, as well as grounds surrounding hotel. A number of guests left messes behind, which were promptly cleaned by staff. Good location, except for lack of signage on Tenaya Ave. which would point toward hotel. Would use this hotel again for future visits.
Room Tip: Most rooms will have highway noise if windows are open.
