<html><head><h3>Hampton Inn Las Vegas/Summerlin Hotel Reviews Page 33</h3></head><body><br>Quiet, good location, nice alternative to the Strip<p>We stayed at this Hampton Inn for 7 nights, while visiting friends in North Las Vegas. It's in an area that has mostly businesses related to health care, and is very close to a hospital. So it's very quiet, especially at night. It does back onto highway I-95, but there isn't a significant amount of noise from the highway. The location is great because you can easily jump onto I-95 and go anywhere. There are plenty of restaurants and shopping within driving distance.

Rooms were great, as usual at a Hampton Inn. Very comfortable beds. Breakfast area was nice, with some tables outside in a courtyard. Pool area was very nice, and usually empty. There is a hot tub, and quite a large pool, with many tables & chairs and loungers. At this time of the year the pool was too cold for us to swim, but would be really nice in hotter months.

If you don't need to stay on the Strip or downtown, then this is a nice alternative. Price was $80 US for two beds. We had no complaints, and would highly recommend this hotel.</p><br>Impressive!<p>I loved this hotel. It is nestled away from the strip with is perfect for the business traveller. Away from the lights and flash but that is still within reach. Next door to the Las Vegas Athletic club as well as many amenities such as Target and Sears. I would recommend staying here any night. The staff was super friendly when the credit card for the business that was paying for my stay got declined and helped me orient myself to Vegas. Danny working the night shift was such a great help!</p><br>Not smoke free<p>I stayed here recently for a business trip. I was supposed to be here for 5 nights but moved to another hotel after 3 nights. I moved because for two nights in a row I could smell cigarette smoke in my room. The first night I called the front desk and their solution was to move me. This in spite of the fact that the ENTIRE HOTEL is non-smoking. I didn't see why I should have to pack up all my stuff and move simply because someone else couldn't follow the rules.

Other observations: The phone has a "Front desk" button on it but neither of the phones in my room would call the front desk. I finally decided to try dialing zero and that worked. I told the front desk that and they said "ya those buttons don't work, you have to dial zero". Can you say poor customer service? Also the shower water pressure on the 3rd floor was very low, took a long time to wash and rinse in the trickle coming from the shower head.

Stayed on the freeway side with was pretty noisy all night long.

I will say that the stay comes with access to Gold's Gym which was nice.</p><br>Great stay except for A/C<p>I stayed here just one short night, arriving at midnight and leaving mid morning the next day Front desk staff and breakfast staff were friendly and helpful. They arranged a taxi for me at the time I requested it. My room was great, but the A/C was not cooling and the thermostat in my room said 85 degrees. My attempts at adjusting the temperature were unsuccessful. I did not mention it to the front desk until I was leaving, as I was there for such a short time. I used the business center and appreciated the convenience of free internet and use of the printer. Breakfast had eggs, potatoes, cereals, fruit, pastries, bagels, juices, and coffee. The coffee was not very good, but everything else was adequate. The breakfast area was very comfortable. Other than the A/C in my room, the hotel is a solid Hampton Inn with all the amenities, conveniences, comfort, and service that keep me loyal to this chain of Hilton hotels. I stayed here on a Hilton Honors award. The location is just 15 minutes to the strip in a quiet area with some shopping nearby.</p><br>Excellent hotel and value<p>I stayed here while on a business trip to Las Vegas. The location was ideal for me based on where I needed to be, and I wanted to avoid the hassle/expense of the big resorts and casinos.

The service here was fantastic, very helpful and friendly staff, complementary cold water and WiFi Internet, cookies in the evenings, and managers receptions as well.

Breakfast is included. It wasn't as nice as the Homewood Suites I've stayed in the past, but it was still ok. Your basic continental buffet plus eggs and one other hot dish. It seems that they don't have an actual kitchen though, so it appeared they only served what they could microwave (no bacon for example). They also had "breakfast to go" bags consisting of water, cereal bars, fruit and a muffin.

The rooms were perfect, comfy beds and newly installed flat screen TVs. A laptop cushion for working in bed was a nice touch. Bathrooms were basic but fine for my needs. The room had a refrigerator and microwave as well.

The only real complaint was the fitness center, it consisted of 2 treadmills, a stair master and a recumbent bike. They did have free passes to the gold's gym about a mile down the road.

Overall though this was a nearly perfect hotel for the business traveler or even for families on a budget looking to avoid the big casino hotel atmosphere.</p><br>Outstanding Service and facilities<p>I am in the military and recently was sent on a temporary duty to Las Vegas. I had never stayed in a Hampton Inn before so I did not know what to expect. When I arrived the staff welcomed me warmly and informed me of places and activities to do around the area. The room was very clean and comfortable with adequate space and comfortable beds. The next morning, the receptionist greeted me by my first name and led me to their incredibly nice hot breakfast. Then as we left we were given a newspaper and a snack bag which was very thoughtful.
The area was very nice and conveniently close to many shopping stores and restaurants. We were far enough from the city for it to be quiet, but close enough to get to the strip in 15 minutes or less. The hotel has a gym, but if you are seriously going to workout while you are there, they offer a free pass to the Gold's Gym about 5 minutes away. All we had to do was show our Hampton Inn room key and no questions were asked. As expected the Gold's Gym was very very nice.
All employees at this location went out of their way to speak to you and make sure you were taken care of. This was one of the best hotels I have stayed in and the customer service was out of this world. They really made me feel at home. This went on for three weeks as our duty lasted. Thanks Hampton Inn. It was a true pleasure to stay with you. I will definitely stay in the chain of hotels and would recommend this hotel to anyone in a heartbeat.</p><br>Better Than Other Hamptons<p>This was a convenient place to stay after flying into Las Vegas for the night. We were headed out to southern Utah the following morning. We also stayed here the night before flying home.

We frequently stay at Hampton Inns while traveling, alternating with bed and breakfast establishments.

This was the best Hampton Inn we've ever stayed at. Everything seemed upgraded a notch - more spacious rooms, better furnishings, more breakfast options.

The front desk staff was very friendly and helpful. We enjoyed our stay, brief as it was, and will book again under similar circumstances.</p><br>Great home away from home<p>I stayed here from August 10 to August 23, on business. I stayed in room 324.

I like this place. My room was clean, the staff were friendly, wireless internet was provided, and I felt very comfortable there. A substantial breakfast is provided by the hotel. Nothing fancy, but a good selection of things to choose from, and very tasty. I wish they'd had waffles, but you can't have everything.

My room was clean, and included a microwave and a refrigerator with freezer. The bed was comfortable, and I slept really well.

My one gripe with the room was that the bathroom had a "low-flush" toilet--the kind that is supposed to save water but you have to flush several times in order for it to complete the job, thus eliminating any savings. Anyway, it clogged three times during my stay. Since I was the only one in the room it was a minor inconvenience.

The hotel is located in Las Vegas, but it's away from "the Strip" and the typical Vegas night scene. This is a great place to stay if you don't need (or want) to be near all the action. The hotel is right next to the freeway, which is convenient, but the airport is on the opposite end of town. Keep this in mind if you need to go to the airport, as some travel time is involved (more time during rush hour).

There was a long queue at check in but the receptionist was very pleasant when dealing with awkward guests. The free cookies were very welcome. Coffee was available at the breakfast bar next to the pool.

We asked for 2 adjacent rooms which were quite spacious and clean.

We all had a midnight dip in the pool which was surreal -swimming in themiddle of the desert with traffic noise speeding past. The rooms were quiet enough.

Breakfast was adequate enough.

A good enough place to rest for the night.</p><br>This was a much better place than expected.<p>I don't know what people are complaining about, but I just finished a two night stay at this property and it was terrific. I used HiltonHHonors points to pay for this stay, which was the main reason why I stayed here. I would not have payed $109+ tax per night to stay here as you can stay on the strip for about the same price. This property is only a 10 minute drive from the strip and is right off the highway (95).

Overall, it is was you would expect from a Hampton. There are some real postives about this property, however, that I would like to mention. First, I arrived late (after 1AM) and had no problems at all checking in. In fact, the lady had set aside my preferred room (King-Non-smoking), so it would not be given away. She didn't even ask for me credit card (though I had entered that info on the website). It was the quickest check-in that I have ever had at a hotel. Second, The hotel offers a small business center with free access to a computer (with internet) and fax machine/printer. This really came in handy. Third, the hotel offers free access to a Gold's Gym nearby. This is great for people staying a while at this property.

My room was clean and the ac worked well. The bathroom was large. My only complaint is that the water pressure was pretty weak. Overall, I was very happy with this Hampton Inn.</p><br></body></html>
