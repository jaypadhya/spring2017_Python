<html><head><h3>Hampton Inn Las Vegas/Summerlin Hotel Reviews Page 31</h3></head><body><br>If You're Looking For The Quiet Side Of Las Vegas<p>Spent a week in Las Vegas on business and wanted a place that was quiet and away from it all. I FOUND IT! I really enjoyed this hotel. It is located in an area that is developed and offers convenience. Lots of choices to choose from for eating and across the street from a Target. The gym is small, but did the job. The laundry is on the first floor and only $1 a load. The hotel was very quiet, walls were thick. The front desk staff were AWESOME! They we so friendly and accommodating. The breakfast is free and and great selections ( waffles, cereal, oatmeal, eggs, etc...) Also, if you did not have time for breakfast, they had grab and go breakfast bags that were a nice touch. Rooms were a nice size, but the carpet looked liked it needed a good cleaning. The hotel is a NON-SMOKING hotel!
Room Tip: If you plan on using the laundry and gym and want convenience, stay on the first floor.

The rooms were nice as well as the staff</p><br>Cean but terrible beds and indifferent service<p>I have one more night booked here and am desperately hoping that my back will recover and that I won't be dead tired on the long road home late tomorrow; I also have two intense days of a seminar to attend and being tied is not what I paid for. In fact I choose this hotel over others due to its high reviews (I awarded only 2 stars instead of 3 so others will beware.) The room itself is functional and clean. . . that is nice. My room overlooks the busy freeway; I am on the third floor and the stairs lead directly to the parking area which is convenient. An elevator is available.

But do not be fooled if you need a good sleeping surface....after all that is the number one thing one pays for in a motel....a GOOD bed and a sound and restful night's sleep. This Inn earned only 2 stars because of the attitude of front desk and their inability to help. I was not offered direction as to where my room was located and when I asked received a surly answer, not impolite, I could overlook it but not exactly welcoming. Next issue is the air conditioner, during the day it seems to function like a charm but at night no matter how low you set the temp it seems to be fixed at a certain level.... that level was not all the cool especially for sleeping. All that happened was that the fan never cycled off... nice and loud! <sigh>

After discovering the miserable mattress I flipped it. Not easy for a small woman to do by herself; the opposite side was a little better. I also tired stuffing the blanket, etc under the bottom sheet....helped a little but I still woke with a very sore back and hips and am short of sleep.

Called the front desk...the phone guide is wrong... btw.... the shortcuts do not work. The morning desk clerk, maybe the same person? was equally unwelcoming without being rude. All their beds were replaced 2 years ago she told me and none of them were any different, all the same. That's hard to believe.... if these beds are only 2 years old they must have scoured the market for poor quality beds. No mattress toppers or anything else available.... and all the rooms will be filled for tonight so she couldn't switch me. Basically my only hope is being sent an extra blanket. .

Motels are in the business of providing a variety of needs.... mine is for a good nights sleep. I hopped in the shower to relieve my tiredness and sore back.... nice shower head and lots of hot water but very little water pressure <sigh... why does one have to pay so much for lack of comfort?) Maybe tonight will be better. Am tired and weary this morning.</p><br>Good, slightly above avg hotel; but avoid rm135!!<p>Great Customer Service, morning breakfast buffet is pretty good, clean room, good layout, convenient location.

But avoid room 135. Very noisy equipment in adjacent room, sounds like the furnace or something. Plus, bottom floor is not so good, the ceiling isn't insulated that well, you can hear ppl walking above you.
Room Tip: Get a room on the top level (3). AVOID room 135!

Only drawback was that there was a high school basketball tournament group staying there so they descended on the breakfasts like locust and we never did get to eat breakfast there. But on the plus side, it was clean and most importantly quiet.
Room Tip: Fourth floor was quiet.

We didn't realize this Hampton Inn was located in a medical complex (hospital, doctors' buildings) but you need not be sick to stay here! It was a lovely property, very attractively decorated, exceptionally clean, large area for breakfast and included a manager's evening reception (I do not believe that is every night) that offered tasty tacos with fixings - enough for a meal. Very friendly staff. We would definitely stay here again if in the area.</p><br>Would definitely stay again<p>We checked in late, and had great accomodations. Rooms were clean (we had 2), and large. We actually had to stay after we checked out, and stayed in the lounge for a while. The clerks were very friendly to us, and didn't mind my kids in the least! We even were given some yogurt after breakfast, just to help my kid. So sweet! I never smelled a speck of smoke anywhere I walked. I would definitely stay there again.</p><br>Great hotel, great service and great breakfast<p>Even the hotel is a little bit far from the strip it's a very nice hotel</p><br>Close to the lacrosse fields, clean rooms, great fronk desk clerks<p>We stayed here this past weekend...2 rooms for 2 nights for a local lacrosse tournament. The front desk clears were so pleasant. Rooms were clean and bed super comfy, with 4 pillows and a spotless duvet. Bathroom had great pressure and was clean. Room was non smoking and did not have even an inking of a smoke oder. I didn't have the breakfast but my husband and son did,..said it was fine. Eggs, bacon, toast, yogurt, oatmeal, juices etc. Lots of close parking, good room temp control ( huge pet peeve of mine) and thick walls =no outside or hall noises coming through. This was so convenient to the sports fields and when we come back again for the events we will definitely stay here. Great value and cleaner and nicer than expected.</p><br>Not much noise insulation<p>We spent two nights here due to it's proximity to the softball fields at Majestic Park. The hotel location is great for all kinds of shopping (Target megastore, Albertsons, Sears etc. etc .)The staff were great in allowing us an early check in due to our game schedule and the included breakfast was your usual fair of omelette, waffles, cereal , and baked goods etc.The coffee in the lobby was available whenever we went down for a cup.The bed was comfortable, the Internet connection was excellent and the kitchen area was good with the fridge and microwave. We had a King suite on the third floor.The only real complaint on this property is the noise from adjoining rooms and hallways.There is a lack of noise insulation in the building of this property, room doors are metal and slam due to door springs, the plumbing noise is loud from showers and toilets in other rooms.If. Ot for these shortcomings , this is a good property.</p><br></body></html>
