<html><head><h3>Hampton Inn Las Vegas/Summerlin Hotel Reviews Page 5</h3></head><body><br>Solid Lower Price Hotel<p>Not the place to go if hanging in the pool is high on your priority list (not cleaned often enough & freeway noise makes it difficult to hear a person from more than 2 feet away), but otherwise a solid choice.</p><br>Nice room but sub-par breakfast<p>Room and hotel typical Hampton Inn quality (good). But the free breakfast left much to be desired. Hot food was not. They don't put salt & pepper at tables, just those annoying paper packets. Oatmeal thin and watery. No breakfast meats Saturday. They could do better.</p><br>Great place<p>In our two weeks of traveling across America, this was the best hotel we stayed in. The staff was very friendly and hard working. The breakfast was great. It has everything needs when traveling: comfortable bed, nice workout room, pool, excellent breakfast, and laundry facility. I would recommend this hotel to anyone.</p><br>Quiet. Comfortable. Very nice.<p>My wife and I had to stay at a hotel for a few nights while our AC at our home was being repaired. Our options were limited due to EDC weekend and I initially chose this property because of its location to my home. I was very pleased with my choice. The room was comfortable, and well appointed, and the morning breakfast was full of options. Will definitely return and would highly recommend.</p><br>Not worth the money<p>I have stayed here 10 nights in the last month and I am not really happy .Terrible outdated hotel, only staying for the points but won't stay again. First stay I had to switch rooms because the first room smelled like cigarettes so bad I couldn't sleep, elevator carpets are disgusting, sheer curtains in room 311 are torn...3rd floor ice machine out of order for entire 5 day stay, a real pain to go to other floors to get ice...had to call front desk to fix the toilet twice, it broke twice. No water pressure in shower. I bought some ice cream and put it in the room freezer, little did I know that it was not working either, after throwing away my melted ice cream the next day I realized that the fridge is plugged into the microwave and not the wall, strange set up but I plugged it into the wall myself and it worked ok, still not really cold though...breakfast.... Could we find something other than frozen omelets and precooked bacon product, canned fruit that all tastes the same and like the preservative that it's packed in, the workers seem to have plenty of time to be on their phones and could find time to clean a little fruit and cook some real bacon, I stayed 5 nights and only had bananas at 1 breakfast. For a Vegas hotel charging over $100.00 a night I really would expect better, maybe lower your REVPAR a little and invest in the product. After this I think I am done with Hilton been disappointed to many to times lately.
Room Tip: Stay somewhere else

Room was clean, quiet, and comfortable. Nice clean pool! Close to everything we were wanting to visit. Great value. Don't have much more to say than I will be sure to come back and please Keep up the great work!</p><br>Excellent and helpful staff<p>This hotel is nice and quiet, no slot machines, smoke, or casino! It's nestled in a quiet area near a hospital and shopping. The staff is incredibly helpful and eager to please. I stay here every time I am working in Vegas and love the residential atmosphere.</p><br>Nice staff-nice hotel but not a good place to sleep!<p>The staff, hotel and hotel grounds, and complimentary breakfast was very nice. My biggest complaint was that there was so much traffic noise from the highway next to the hotel that I could not sleep very well. If the hotel improved its sound proofing, it would get a 4-5 rating!</p><br>Good Hampton experience<p>This hotel was perfect for what I desired. Convenient to wherever you maybe want to go in Las Vegas (you could get anywhere in town in about 15 minutes from here), but not stuck in all of the hubbub. Quiet, relaxed stay, helpful and courteous staff, plenty of parking available at no charge, and plenty decent of places to eat nearby. It was clean, WiFi worked well, I would definitely stay here again.</p><br>I truly enjoyed staying in this hotel<p>Anyone who travel in this area should check into this hotel. The staff are friendly and helpful. The services are exceptional. We really enjoyed our night stay and the morning breakfast fit right into our schedule.</p><br></body></html>
