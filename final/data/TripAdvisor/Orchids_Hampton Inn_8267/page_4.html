Staff not ready for prime time.<p>Upon arriving at this hotel it exceeded both my adult daughter and my expectations. The room was very clean and comfortable. the facilities were very nice especially the pool and breakfast areas. The sleep quality was well above average. The issue I had is that I booked this room through Orbitz and when I went to check out they said I could not get a receipt because it was booked through a third party. I never ran into this so I asked again if I could just get a hotel receipt for my records? They said I would have to contact Orbitz. Upon arriving home a few days later I found that Hampton had made two odd numbered charges totally $37.14 to my credit card. I called Hampton Inn and asked them what the charges were for? I was put on hold for about ten minutes and then the receptionist said that it must be a incidental hold but she did not know why there was such odd amounts in two different charges. She said it should be returned to my card in a few days. As of six days later the money still has not been returned to my card and I will have to make a second call. As a busy person my time is valuable and having to call not once but at least twice to get monies returned to my card that should have never been charged is disappointing. Time is money and as a business travelers hotel a receipt and prompt corrective service when an error in billing is made is expected but was not delivered. Hampton can do better than this. .</p><br>Beautiful rooms, excellent service and great breakfast.<p>We stayed there for our first time in Vegas and it was amazing! Rooms are beautiful, clean and beds are very comfortable. Fantastic Breakfast,very good selection of food
and awesome customer Service.. our two days stay at the Hampton Inn was a quiet and pleasant experience. We will definitely be back!!</p><br>Rude<p>Should have known this was going to be bad when we couldn't pull into the drive way because it was filled with 5 police cars. Front desk lady was rude (Philippine with glasses). Asked if we may be able to check in early she said no, I asked what time check in was she said 3 check in is always at 3. Then she said probably wouldn't be ready at 3 maybe 4. I asked to speak to a manager she said was not one there. We prepaid so I couldn't cancel the reservation. They need customer service training, too say it politely.</p><br>WOULD STAY AGAIN<p>Great location for my needs, as well as convenient to other restaurants. Far enough away from the strip to not have to deal with the traffic. Guest room nothing special but had peeling wallpaper in bathroom. MW and fridge in room. A/C quite loud. Complimentary breakfast with good selections and pleasant helpful staff. Dining area rather small but OK. Hotel is apparently an older Hampton. Room rate great. Sufficient parking and in secure area.</p><br>Always Excellent !<p>I've stayed here many times, and am always glad that I stayed here, even if it meant travelling a few extra miles to go out to Summerlin from the Vegas Strip street area. The Staff is always professional and friendly. The room is always clean. There are a variety of places to eat that are nearby and convenient to get to. Heat and Air are individually controlled, and work very well. My only disappointment is when they are booked up and don't have a room for me! This is my "Go To" place to stay, even when I have to go into the Las Vegas proper.
Room Tip: Top floors

If on business, request the third floor. Hilton Hampton is constantly upgrading rooms to accommodate travelers.</p><br>Fine Hotel<p>Very nice staff, a good quiet place to stay. You can get out to Red Rocks easily and there are many good places to dine. Also stores are nearby and Tenaya Creek Brewery is close enough to walk to. I enjoy their beers/ales. If you are working in the downtown area it is a short drive.</p><br>Queit Restful Sleep<p>We booked this hotel at the last minute. It was in the area where we needed, a bit off the main road and somewhat hard to spot at first. We checked in after 3am and they allowed us a late check out of 1pm the next day. Everything was clean and quiet. The bed was so comfortable and we slept very well. We would totally recommend this hotel to others.</p><br>Pleasant People = Pleasant Stay<p>Stayed here for two nights. Even with some serious scrutiny it is hard to find any faults with this property, and I am not writing this review to point out faults, rather than to applaud the people here. I never had any interchange with any employee here that was not a pleasant one. Front desk: very cordial, accommodated an early check in. House keeping: willing to meet special requests. Breakfast attendant: it was a pleasure to meet her, and see some one go about what many would see as a menial job with a good spirit and a smile on her face. The breakfast is on par with Wyndham standards. The location was perfect for my visit.</p><br>Hampton Inn, Summerlin.<p>After a brief mix up during check in, which was quickly corrected by a move to another room and a rate adjustment, our four day stay at the Hampton In was a pleasant experience. Clean, quiet and pleasant stay.</p><br></body></html>
