I think this hotel is good for people who are looking for bad service .. I will never ever stay here again !!!!</p><br>Not a bad place to stay!!<p>The breakfast is top notch, not your usual cereal and muffins, you get a hot breakfast, which is great! The rooms are a bit outdated but clean and comfortable. Not too far from the strip, and minutes away from local restaurants. Parking a bit cramped but stayed on a weekend which was completely booked. Front desk staff "Ruby," very sweet and helpful, made us feel very welcome. Only glitch... our keys were not working and upon returning to the front desk for assistance, we did not feel the same friendly upbeat demeanor... "Judy" a different clerk, was now tending to the front desk and appeared to annoyed that we needed new keys. I suppose this is due to being extremely busy; but poor customer service is always a "no" "no." Other than that.. thumbs up for this establishment.. will stay there again.
Room Tip: Stay away from the rooms near the freeway

Not only did they go through my luggage, they even broke the handle on my luggage and the staff acted like it was no big deal. Would not stay here again.</p><br>Not upto scratch<p>Stayed 2 nights 20th and 21st September. i checked in online and picked my room prior to arrival so check in was very quick. Hotel corridor smelt similar to a hospital kitchen after dishes have been washed this smell seemed to hang around even when you entered your room. Rooms could do with an upgrade as they seemed to have had quite a lot of wear. Bed linen clean and fresh. Breakfast area clean and food selection good. Hampton seem to have stopped having coffee in lobbie in the evenings and the coffee in the morning and coffee supplied in the room is not as nice as they previously supplied for guests.</p><br>Will Stay here again<p>The staff is helpful and very friendly. Decor is better than most hotels I have stayed at. The breakfast food was great with lots of fresh fruits. ie sliced pineapple and melon. Each day the hot dish was different. Rooms are quiet and comfortable. Location was nice for me, close to family and far enough from the "Strip" that I was not tempted to visit there. I will be staying here the next time I visit my family in Las Vegas, NV</p><br>Off the beaten path<p>I haven't been to Las Vegas since I was single and in my mid-twenties. Going to clubs and partying until dawn are no longer my bread and butter, so my husband and I opted to enjoy LV in a different light, starting with the hotel.

We arrived right at 3pm where Isabelle(Isabella?) greeted us with a smile and provided prompt check-in. Our very clean, non-smoking room on the third floor was prepared beautifully by Luz. We had no issues with all in-room appliances and amenities -- everything was functioning as promised. I never use the toiletries provided by hotels because they tend to be overly fragrant and drying to my skin/hair. But Hampton Inn provided Neutrogena products so I was pleasantly surprised by their brand of choice.

Another pleasant surprise was the hotel's breakfast. My husband and I woke up early to try to catch the sunrise at Red Rock Canyon and an employee was able to provide us with breakfast to-go bags filled with a proper meal to start our small adventure. Please note that this very nice gesture may not always be available, but I don't think it hurts to ask. A few hours later, we returned to the hotel to find that a hot breakfast was still available. Scrambled eggs with cheese, sausage, biscuits and gravy, fresh fruit, a variety of pastries, yogurt, and a waffle machine -- what a treat after a Sunday morning hike! The ladies in the dining area kept the food refilled and the space clean.

The hotel location was excellent for our chosen activities and the easy freeway access is definitely a plus. I've found my new go-to place to stay in LV if we have the chance to visit again. Thank you for your hospitality, Hampton Inn!</p><br>Business Travel<p>I travel to Vegas for business at least once a month and this location is very close to my clients office. I did stay at a Resort on one of my trips and came right back to the Hampton Inn. The Staff is great and breakfast is wonderful and the fridge and microwave in the room is great to have when you are working late and do not want to go out. The rooms are clean, but could use a little d√©cor refresh. It is also a great value especially in Vegas.</p><br>Excellent property<p>We enjoyed our stay at the property and was easy to find our way around the valley. I came to town to spend time with my aging father and also time with our grandchildren. We accomplished everything we came to town to do. It was a very enjoyable trip.</p><br>Nice but noisy<p>The hotel is located adjacent to the 95 freeway and the traffic is loud and continuous...although my room was at the far end of the property (which I selected) so other rooms might not experience this problem. The key cards malfunction on the exit doors causing you to visit the front desk for as replacement. The staff are very nice and the hotel is clean and fresh.</p><br>Very nice hotel<p>The best thing about this hotel is the front desk staff they always make me feel welcome like family since I stay here almost 2 weeks for business. It is an older Hampton but rooms the rooms are very spacious and clean. This is my 3rd time staying here . Nice breakfast and cookies at night. Very good location a couple minutes off 95 and many restaurants about 5 minutes away.</p><br></body></html>
