<html><head><h3>Hampton Inn Las Vegas/Summerlin Hotel Reviews Page 9</h3></head><body><br>Short stay<p>The Queen beds were too soft for my back, not the hotels fault they ran out of the King beds by the time I booked. The breakfast was very good as usual, and the staff was great. The gym was workable. The rooms were spotless everyday I returned. This was the first time I did not get complmentary bottled water.</p><br>Bad Hampton<p>This is an atypical Hampton experience for me. I would avoid this location. The hotel is dated, the rooms are marginal with a lot of street/HWY noise . If you have a profile good luck 1 didn't seem to matter that I have Gold Status . Make sure you know where Star Bucks is located, if you drink coffee . The breakfast kitchen staff didn't seem to know when the coffee pots were or that they were empty.</p><br>First Time at a Hampton<p>I have stayed at a lot of Hilton properties and this was the first time I have stayed at a Hampton Inn and I was pleasantly surprised. Good sized rooms, free internet for Hhonors members if you book on Hilton.com and a reasonable breakfast is included.

There's a great brew pub restaurant across the road a Whole Foods down the road and a Target a block or so away. Also it's near a large hospital and countless doctor's offices.

The only downside - it's very close to the freeway and the noise can be a little intrusive but I would stay here again but ask for a room on the front side of the hotel.
Room Tip: Ask for a room at the front of the hotel away from the freeway

It features: Easy Parking, efficient check-in, clean rooms, great breakfast with extended hours. And the staff is very friendly and attentive. If you desire that use of a pool, hot tub, or work out gym these are all convenient to access as well. Overall... I'll be back</p><br>Clean and Fresh<p>I stayed here when I had to be at an event close by early the next morning in the northwest end of Las Vegas. It is a distance from the strip which is good and bad depending on the purpose of your stay. From the rooms to the breakfast buffet, my colleague and I both commented on how clean this hotel is. The front desk staff was friendly upon check in and recommended to us the Aces and Ales restaurant as somewhere to go within walking distance. The breakfast buffet was fabulous, and the stay in general was great. I even took a bath because the room was that clean. My only downfall was the TV in my room did not work and I reported it. They were going to immediately send someone up but I was in bed so told them to fix it the next day.</p><br>A Little Disappointed<p>Love, love Hampton Inns but this hotel was a disappointment. The positives = excellent front desk staff, housekeepers and breakfast staff, all great. The room was very clean. Breakfast was usual Hampton offering and was very good. Coffee in lobby was fabulous, always there & fresh & hot. So why the 3 average rating? The bed was not comfortable at all. Mattress was very thin & hard, no pillowtop/cushioning of any kind. Didn't sleep well for 2 nights there.</p><br>Quiet and friendly hotel<p>Location is off the strip. Quiet and nice hotel. Friendly and helpful staff. Pool was not heated and the water was very cold. Only room available was a smoking room. Even though the room was clean it smelled like smoke which was unpleasant. I would stay here again but only if a non-smoking room was available.</p><br>Golf Stay<p>Very nice hotel, desk clerk Jo Jo made us feel welcome and offered good advice on the hotel area and restaurant recommendations. Great complimentary breakfast, Wi Fi connection is only so so, could receive E mails but sending was problematic. Could hear upstairs guest through ceiling.</p><br>Outside strip<p>It is a hotel outside strip without a casino. Very nice and quiet. Big and clean rooms. Very nice breakfast buffet. It has a shuttle both to airport and strip. It takes 20 minutes walking to strip. The staff are very helpful.</p><br>friendly hotel<p>the staff are wonderful and greet me by name every evening, the rooms are clean, everything is bright, internet is great; delicous complimentary breakfast; complimentary cookies to make every evening great!</p><br></body></html>
