Its an easy to get on and off the 95. Might not be convenient for those who want/need to be on the strip, but if you are to be on the West side at all - its a great hotel.</p><br>Unclean and Lots of Smoke<p>I've stayed at several Hampton inn's in the past and have never been disappointed except with my stay at this particular property. This property doesn't deserve the right to bear the name Hampton inn it's more of a motel 6. When I first entered the lobby you could smell the scent of smoke the carpet was old dirty and dated but I thought nothing of it and proceeded to check in for my 5 week stay (for business). Once I entered the room the smoke hit me like a ton of bricks even though the room I was assigned was a non-smoking room in addition the room was dirty you could see dust and dirt caked to the corner of the carpet all around the room. Being that I am Super sensitive to smoke I could not stay in that room comfortably. I went down to the lobby and they had me try a total of 4 additional rooms with the same experience with each room. I asked if smoking was allowed in the hotel at all and I was informed that smoking was allowed in the rooms on the first floor which explained why the two floors above smelled like smoke even though the rooms on both the second and third floors were considered "non-smoking" as smoke rises!! I settled for a room just for the night, thankfully the windows in the room could open as I had to sleep with it open since turning on the ac made the smoke smell even worse. I called down to see if they could change the filter in the ac unit and was told that there was no one on staff at the time to change the filter. The next issue on top of the smoking and unclean rooms was the bathroom I attempted to take a shower and as the shower ran with the drain open water began to fill up in the tub as if I was taking a bath, there was something clogging the drain and preventing the water from properly flowing out which caused the back up, "GROSS"! I spent the entire night miserable runny nose, itchy eyes and sore throat from the smoke. Since it was march madness finding hotel rooms for my stay was difficult but since I couldn't sleep- I spent the majority of the night searching for available hotels to send to our executive assistance so I could check out the following day after I left the office. Found a gem of a hotel that is clean and smoke free for almost the same price that this property is charging. I won't be staying at this property again! It needs major renovations!</p><br>Dirty but at least the service is bad<p>This was a very dirty hotel. We booked it for a softball tournament. The field was cleaner than the carpet in our room.
I had to wash the tub on our arrival so my little one could bathe. When she walked to the bed from the tub, her feet got dirty from the carpet. Dust was everywhere and the counter surfaces were sticky in places.
I asked the front desk to have our room cleaned the next day. I guess I should have been specific. The beds and towels were changed, that's all.
Really gross, and poor service. No apologies or even courteous smiles.</p><br>Met our expectations<p>We are frequent Hampton Inn customers when traveling. We selected this Hampton in Summerlin for it's location for ease of departure, and avoid morning Las Vegas traffic, as we were headed north, away from Las Vegas. The hotel was clean and modern, and the room was excellent. The food area is somewhat small but adequate. Would definitely stay here again.</p><br>Just ok<p>Second time to stay here. This time we got a room that was very noisy and very ugly. The rooms need to be re done. They were clean and the location was what we needed. The AC was so noisy we opened up the window for fresh air...and got freeway noise...no AC! I know all of the rooms are not like that but this one was pretty bad.</p><br>ask for non smoking room when you book<p>Overall very good stay. The complimentary breakfast was really good with excellent variety. Clean rooms. Definitely tell staff when you book that you do not want a smoking room We got one, tried to move, were moved to another smoking room. It was not as bad, but that smell just stays with the room. The fitness center is a bit small, but not unexpected in a smaller hotel. I would stay again for sure and just make sure I asked for a non smoking room--cable tv was a bit off.</p><br>long weekend stay with the kids<p>hotel was in decent shape and located very well off the freeway and close to a number of restaurants, parks, shops etc. Every member of staff we had contact with was amazing - the breakfast folks were great and the front desk staff attended to every request we had. Breakfast was the best Hampton Inn breakfast I have had!.
Only negative was that the pool is not heated so we couldn't take the kids swimming at any time.</p><br>Zero point Zero<p>There is nothing except horrible to describe my Experience here. Place was so hard to find, moreover i a Hilton Honors gold member and was treated like trash.. With a baby they put us in a smoking room, when we asked to change rooms it took them 1hr to get back to us and say no, we had to ask what else can be done to help us out and they said nothing .. The hotel was so loud with yelling people it was crazy..we then ended up leaving the hotel and just spending the night at a casino near the strip..0.0 is the rating here</p><br>Did not meet my Hampton expectations!<p>I was really disappointed by this Hampton - from check in to check out! To begin with, every time I came by the desk, it was vacant. Every time! When I checked in, as a reward member, I asked if there was an upgraded room available. She said they only did that for Hilton Honors members. When I gave her my Hilton #, she then said they don't do upgrades for people who pay via third party. I had booked with hotels.com. Well which is it? You can't say you only do it for honors members, and then I provide that info say you on; do it for people who pay the hotel directly. But, there was nothing I could do, so we continued with check in.
We got the room and it was small and fairly outdated. I hadn't been in a Hampton that had double beds in quite some time. In fact, I stayed at a different Hampton (on Eastern) just last month and was upgraded to a beautiful suite, without even asking). Can you guess where I'd be staying for my next trip. Okay, moving along.
The water was HOT HOT HOT, regardless of which way the handle was turned. The tiled handle needed to be held down in order to be flushed. I asked for extra blanket, comforter and sheet, and a sheet arrived moments later. Prompt? YES. What I asked for? NO! UGH
The breakfast staff was nice, but the food was cold. Cod sausage? No thank you. She was nice enough to warm it up, but really?
The morning I checked out, I had a bill under my door. Remember, I couldn't be upgraded because I had prepaid wit a third party? Yet a bill under my door. I went down to the desk, and waited easily 5 minutes for someone to come out. I showed the bill and she took it from me and told me that wasn't my bill and it wasn't my credit card that was being charged, yet it had my name on it and was under my door.
Just not the Hampton stay I have become accustomed to. I will NOT be staying at this location again!</p><br>Perfect "Off-The-Strip" Hotel<p>I was staying in this hotel to attend a seminar in the Northwest area of Las Vegas. Access to I-95 north and south was extremely easy and made for quick trips to Indian Springs (45 miles north) and connection to I-15 for travel to south Las Vegas. Also convenient to downtown Las Vegas if your here for leisure.</p><br></body></html>
