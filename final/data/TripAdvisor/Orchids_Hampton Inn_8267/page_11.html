Very nice hotel and great facilities for leisure. Rooms were incredibly clean and modern and the bathroom was spotless. Staff were very kind and if your looking for a decent night in Vegas then i think this is what you would have in mind.</p><br>Great for business<p>If you are going to Las Vegas on routine business and either don't care for or don't have time for the full sin city experience, this hotel in North Las Vegas gives you the beautiful views and weather of the Nevada desert, without the noisy casinos, flashing lights, and drunken stupors you will encounter at an overpriced hotel on the strip. It's a 15 minute drive from all the sin you may be looking for, but you can count on a restful sleep and a free breakfast in the morning.</p><br>Great as always....<p>The Hampton Inns are always a safe bet and our stay was GREAT! Staff was very nice, location right off the freeway, and place was very clean. The only thing the wife did mention was room could use some wall decorations. They are just a plane white.</p><br>quite hideaway<p>this is a very clean Hotel we stay in Vegas often and this was our first visit to the Hampton Inn they had the best variety for breakfast good fresh fruit... good coffee!!!! thats a plus for me the beds were very comfortable we will stay again</p><br>Work To Do, Guarantee Honored<p>This hotel has maintenance issues (relatively minor fixes) that led to a relatively unrestful nights' sleep. Between broken beds, a worn out TV and an accumulation of trash in the parking lot, their maintenance department needs better leadership or simply more man-hours to address the issues.</p><br>Best quiet hotel<p>The Hampton located off of Tenaya and Cheyenne in Las Vegas is one of the cleanest, quietest and friendliest hotels in Las Vegas. We stay here because it does not have gaming on site and is quiet. It has it's own pool and hot tub, exercise room and a great staff. Located close to shopping and just off of highway 95.</p><br>Close to hospital<p>We have stayed twice at this Hakpton Inn. My sister is in the hospital and it it close by. The staff let us check in early which saved us time. The breakfast was hot and the coffee good. We have stayed in several Hampton Inn's across the US and are always satisfied.</p><br>Christmas with Family in Vegas<p>This hotel has excellent and friendly staff, good clean rooms, very good and tasty breakfast with a wide variety of foods, and is a great value for the money. We will definitely stay at this Hampton Hotel anytime we visit family in Las Vegas.</p><br>The breakfast is poor but hotel is great.<p>Get coffee and oatmeal and be on your way. The rooms are clean and comfortable. Service is outstanding. We had a quiet room and we were facing the freeway. We turned the refrigerator off so the cycling didn't disturb us. We turned the AC/Heat off because it was so cold outside we didn't need it and the recycling didn't disturb us either.</p><br>A very pleasant surprise<p>We stayed a few days at this hotel as a base for our winter holiday in Vegas and were very pleasantly surprised by the quality and spaciousness of the rooms, the very decent breakfast and the welcoming staff. Our main interest was the Red Rocks Canyon area for hiking and sports climbing. Even though we stayed in rooms that faced the highway, the noise level was quite ok. Quality of the Wifi signal was quite OK too (my test is Netflix access).</p><br></body></html>
