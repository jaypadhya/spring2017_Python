And if the pool is a place to spend any free time I would suggest a 1st floor room.</p><br>All around great place to stay!<p>This hotel gets everything right. Nice, helpful desk person. Good breakfast. Very clean room. It's by the freeway but the room was quiet. There are many good restaurants within a mile. I will stay there again!</p><br>Great stay - enjoyed this location and good value!<p>We stayed at this hotel for two nights during my daughter's softball camp. The hotel is very clean, new and had nice amenities. We had to leave earlier than when breakfast was offered, but there were to-go brown bags the hotel had available for such situations. The neighborhood was nice and there were many areas to shop and eat close by. I will stay here every time we come to Vegas - it was nice to stay off the strip and away from everything associated to the strip.</p><br>Great experience, great value, and away from the strip.<p>We picked this hotel as a place to stay while traveling through vegas. It's a pretty good distance from the strip, which was fine since we wanted to avoid the strip that night and just needed a good place to sleep. The neighborhood was nice and I felt very safe, we arrived around 9pm and it was quiet and nobody was around. It's not in a trashy part of las vegas.

The woman at the front desk was very nice and we got checked in quickly. The room was very clean, the bed was extremely comfortable, and the sheets and bedding was very soft and clean. The room had an HDTV and good cable channels. The A/C worked great as well. The bathroom had a nice neutrogena hygiene kit, which I loved! The wifi was fast, and free. The room walls were thick, I didn't hear a single sound and slept great. I've never felt more relaxed and 'at-home' than I have in any other hotel.

We had their free breakfast buffet, which was of pretty good quality and variety. On the way out I grabbed a cup of coffee for the road at their free coffee station that they have by the front counter, it was freshly made and tasted good.

I've never experienced such value at any other hotel, and surprisingly the quality is quite nice too. The price I paid for the room was the only expense, there were no hidden charges and I didn't get jerked around. This is definitely a place for the sensible traveler. This was my first stay at a Hampton Inn, and I will definitely consider them again for future travels.</p><br>Hampton Inn, Summerlin, NV<p>We only stayed one night at the Hampton Inn, but we both liked it a lot. Room was very quiet and clean. Beds were comfortable.Staff were friendly and helpful. Very good buffet breakfast was included. Exercise room was nice. A little bit hard to find, but near I95 so very accessible to other areas of Las Vegas. We'd stay there again if we were in the area.</p><br>Stay elsewhere if you value safety!<p>This was the worst hotel experience I've ever had; I've stayed in a lot of Hamptons. My car window was smashed in their parking lot; items were taken. The mgmt. acted like they truly didn't care. I was told that they have no cameras in the parking lot to keep your vehicle safe.
Room Tip: Stay away if you value safety. They have no camera's to keep the parking lot safe.

Easy access to surface streets and fast headed to anywhere on the west side. The room was quiet and furniture was newer and in great shape. Huge thank you to the staff!</p><br>Great stay. Not near downtown or strip, but great location for other business<p>Stayed here in July 2014. Business trip. Checkin was easy and was recognized as a Silver HiltonHonors with candy bars and a drink. Nice treat. Not treated this way at most other Hampton Inns.

Front desk clerks (2 of them at this Hampton, a good idea) made checkin easy and a pleasant experience. And our rooms were ready!

Everything in my room was clean, AC was already on in room, and everything worked. NO issues.

In the evenings, this property had an evening buffet, hamburgers/hot dogs, chips, etc. Not all Hampton Inns do this and it is not noted on their web page. This was an nice extra and surprise.

Breakfast was very good and entire experience at this Hampton was perfect.</p><br>Wonderful stay!!!<p>We found this hotel by chance when looking for a hotel in Summerlin...what a pleasant surprise! Very clean hotel, spacious rooms, all kinds of services (gym, pool, business room, complimentary coffee), hot and cold breakfast included....what more can you wish for? I certainly recommend it!</p><br>Family Friendly in Sin City<p>If you are looking for a family friendly hotel experience away from the strip in Las Vegas, this is the place. It is quiet and clean. The beds are great, as is the complimentary breakfast. The staff is friendly and efficient. Just a great place to stay!</p><br></body></html>
