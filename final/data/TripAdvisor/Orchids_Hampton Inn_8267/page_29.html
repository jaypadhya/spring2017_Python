<html><head><h3>Hampton Inn Las Vegas/Summerlin Hotel Reviews Page 29</h3></head><body><br>Good Stay<p>The staff was very helpful and the hotel was very nice. We enjoyed 4 nights at the hotel. The breakfast was good, the room was clean and spacious, and the workout room was nice. I would suggest the Hampton inn to anyone.</p><br>Great Red Rock location<p>I was pleasantly surprised by this hotel. The location was easy access from the 215 fwy and a short drive to the Red Rock Canyon. The front desk personnel were very friendly and always helpful. Our room was perfect size, clean, and modern. Loved the bed. The morning breakfast had a good selection of eggs, turkey sausage, make your own waffles, cereals, yogurt, and pastries. Overall I will definitely stay here again when I make a Red Rock trip.</p><br>Sorry..just Average at this one<p>Been to quite a few Hamptons while traveling for work and pleasure.this one didn't quite make a mark. It appears they were doing some remodeling work. Computer in business room did not work was unable to print boarding passes. Breakfast was only average, normal Hampton menu but did not seem as fresh as other Hamptons I've stayed at. We were given 1 of the 2 larger rooms on each floor (second and third floors only) which was nice. Rooms are normal cleanliness and nice bathrooms as usual. Staff was friendly I did not go out of their way. So stay rated as average only. Location is prime right next to the hospital and there are many restaurants a short drive away. Red Rock park is 15 minute drive also. Don't want to discourage you, but it just wasn't up to my normal expectations.</p><br>Never stay at Hampton Inn again<p>1. Defective electric outlet at bedside ruined out my cell phone battery.
2. Defective printer in Bus. Ctr. printed page that faded to illegibility w/in 8 hr.
3. Crazy wiring such that front door light switch must be ON in order for bedside lamps to function. Have never encountered such a wacky setup before</p><br>Don't know how it got good ratings<p>I prefer Hampton and stayed here based on prior experiences with Hampton/Hilton and previous reviews and am beginning to wonder who in the heck is rating these places. Dirty, dirty, dirty. The walls, elevator, carpet- it was disgusting. Kids running up and down the halls yelling, trying to open my door. The bed skirts were about 10 inches to long and I tripped on them when walking to/from the door or bathroom.

The only good side to this hotel is that the staff was very friendly.</p><br>Comfortable, safe and a very nice place to stay!!!<p>Close to everything and in a safe neighborhood. Pool is outside and not heated so be prepared for this only thing wrong if it is cold. There is a hot tub for older kids and adults. Staff was wonderful and willing to help.
Room Tip: Maybe ask for a room away from the highway. My room was very quiet.

Bed is a little hard, but that's just my back that needs a softer bed. Did I mention the free freshly baked cookies available in the evening? Yumm!</p><br>Nice alternative off the Strip<p>I was in town for the CES show and stayed here for 3 nights. It offered much cheaper rates and is conveniently located close to the highway - only about 20-minute drive from the strip. The room is nice and clean, but the WiFi was slow so I only used it for my laptop. The 4G service on my cell is much faster. Also the ice machine was broken on the 2nd floor, so I had to go to the 3rd floor to get ice.

The staff was friendly and my check-in was very efficient. The breakfast was on par with other Hampton Inns, and I was pleasantly surprised to find that they offered different varieties on each day during my stay. Overall this is a very good alternative off the strip especially during peak seasons like the CES.</p><br>Very nice place with a cool theme.<p>I-Liked-This-Place!

A little tricky to find, at the far side of a large shopping and restaurant complex. At first glance I was sure it was going to be a noisy night.
Tons of parking for all sizes of vehicles. Very nice folks at the counter at check-in. Very clean and warmly decorated. The room was a two-queen bed with a very nice desk/work area (see pic). The WiFi was solid, good consistant signal. The bed was standard, the pillows were pretty firm and full (not to my liking) and there was a nice duvet over the bed. There was a post-it note stuck to the headboard saying "the duvet has been laundered for your comfort", I liked that.

There was a cool, comfortable, humorous theme they had in place that I haven't seen before. For example instead of the typical "Do Not Disturb" card, they had a card with an image of a child sleeping and the word "Dreaming" printed on it (see pic). Next to each room number there was a cool looking black & white photograph (mine was a cowboy hat) that made it easy to spot my room before really looking at the number; every room had a different picture, all neat looking. The coffee dispensers in the lobby didn't just say decaff and regular, they had an image of an old fashond gas pump and Leaded & Unleaded marked on them. The clock-radio in my room had buttons on the top that said "POP, Country, Jazz, Soft Rock & Oldies so you don't have to try and scan for music. There's more, but you get the picture. All small stuff for sure, but it creates an air of comfort & subtle humor i've not seen in other hotels.

The room was quiet in spite of all the parking lot traffic from the Las Vegas Athletic Club next door. When I first walked into my room the heat was intense. The thermostat read 80. Somebody left the heater cranked up very high. Eventhough I set it to the lowest it would go, the A/C cool would not put out and as a result I was way, way too hot all night resulting a crappy nights sleep. Yes, I know, should have switched rooms but....

There is a few nice restaurants within walking distance. The breakfast offering was basic/standard with a roomy comfortable area to sit.</p><br>Great Customer Service<p>Easy check-in, great customer service, very helpful, I will stay at this hotel again. The breakfast was excellent and the selection was great. Quiet room, A/C worked well. Great North Las Vegas location.</p><br></body></html>
