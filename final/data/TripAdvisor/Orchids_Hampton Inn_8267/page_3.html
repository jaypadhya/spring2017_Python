<html><head><h3>Hampton Inn Las Vegas/Summerlin Hotel Reviews Page 3</h3></head><body><br>Nice staff, dated rooms<p>The rooms feel a little tired, but I had no complaints. They were clean, the bed was comfortable and it was quiet. The staff was helpful. If you are headed to the strip, this is probably not a great place to stay. But if you want to be in Summerlin, it is a good choice.</p><br>Great room amenities!<p>Our room was pleasantly equipped with a small fridge and microwave. The room was nice, clean, and quiet. The beds weren't the most comfortable I have slept on. Also, when we went to breakfast, at 8 am, they were already out of a lot of food and didn't seem to be replacing it any too quickly.</p><br>Great Hotel as always<p>I stay at this hotel often and it has a great atmosphere, its clean and the staff is friendly and helpful. I have never had a complaint. Easy access off the 95 in a safe neighborhood near lots of food choices and bars nearby within walking distance.</p><br>Great hotel!<p>The quality and cleanliness of this hotel is excellent! The price was perfect for my budget! Free guest internet kept my kids busy! I will definitely book again with Hampton Inn no matter where I travel!</p><br>stay @ the Hampton Inn<p>I was very satisfied with my stay @ the Hampton Inn. staff was professional and friendly. I would stay there again. good breakfast and great coffee. wifi service was good. pool and jacuzzi were relaxing and enjoyable after a long day.</p><br>Comfortable and friendly<p>Nice Hampton Inn off of Tenaya Way in Summerlin. Friendly staff, nice breakfast, very nice housekeeping and lots of parking. Fridge and microwave in room was handy.
Ask for a room not facing the freeway.
Room Tip: Some soundproofing, however ask not to face the freeway.

I really liked the room, very comfortable, and the pool, a pleasure in the heat of the desert. In front of the hampton inn you can see the excalibur hotel. I appreciated also the breakfast.</p><br>The staff was extreemly nice and professional<p>In particular Jack the shuttle driver took real good care of myself and my co-workers. He was prompt on pickup and was on time every time. and at the end of the day he would show up within minutes of our call, even if it was not time for the scheduled end of day. He also had excellent advice on food and entertainment.
Room Tip: Was on the 6th floor with a view of the strip.

This hotel was located 15 minutes from location of funeral and family member's house. They gave us a $20/night discount as a bereavement rate. Greatly appreciate the discount. Nice clean rooms, great variety of food for breakfast. We had a room with 2 beds, but they were double beds, not queen. Not the best mattresses which meant not the quality of sleep. The check-in & check-out process was very good and the staff was very cordial and helpful.</p><br>Clean, good value<p>Good, clean rooms and a working wifi. The breakfast buffet was a bit wider than typical and included fresh fruit. There was an option to pick up a ready-made breakfast bag to go. We appreciated the 24/7 coffee stand in the lobby. Location of the hotel is a bit far from The Strip, but there were good connections to the interstates.</p><br></body></html>
