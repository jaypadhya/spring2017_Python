<html><head><h3>Hampton Inn Las Vegas/Summerlin Hotel Reviews Page 19</h3></head><body><br>Softball Tournament<p>My family and I stayed here during a softball tournament weekend. The hotel was perfectly located to the fields and was close enough for us to head to the strip at night. The staff was very pleasant and the hotel was very clean. The extra large room was a nice fit for the four of us to stay in one room without feeling too cramped. We will definitely stay here again.</p><br>Family vacation<p>The Hampton Inn was excellent, great location but not on the strip, 15-20 min drive . Walk to shopping mail and with good places to eat. Nice work-out room. Staff were nice and the breafest was very good</p><br>Very good. Advice to stay.<p>Nice hotel, very clean room good beds quality, nice service, nice breakfast and good breakfast area. Reasonable room price. Convenient location, close to highway #95, not so far from the Las Vegas downtown.
Room Tip: I am not sure which size of the building we had a room (#337), that side was quite.

I was up around North Las Vegas on business and decided to stay at this property, as a HHonors member and also the great value at this property. I've always wanted to check out this property as I've been to vegas many times, but never had the need to stay up in or around Summerlin, this isn't until now. The checkin process was smooth - the lady who checked me in was funny and very friendly (and also gave me 6 tolberones in my bag - thank you!!), i was given a room near an outdoor airconditioning unit but was graciously moved to a superb room - thanks so much again. The gym, room was great and had free weights and a wonderful LED tv. The breakfast choices were vast including Breakfast Potatoes, Chorizo Sausages, Scrambled Eggs, plenty of fruits, yoghurts, and even Picante spicy salsa sauce! The pool area looked superb (and empty - which was even better), sadly I didn't have time to check it out. Checkout was quick, friendly and you can see although this property is older, the staff try very hard to maintain this to the best possible standard. And for the price proposition it's great, i'll definitely be staying here again. Oh and I love the cranberry and white chocolate cookies which came out in the evening! YUM!
Room Tip: Ask for a room not facing the highway.

It is close to the Freeway and our room was on that side, but the noisy was not that bad. We paid a higher price for that weekend, but it was a pleasant stay in a decent neighborhood.</p><br>Expected Better From Hamptonn<p>I am a Hilton Gold member and travel and stay in Hampton Inns all over the Southwest. This was probably the worst Hampton Inn, or at least the most disappointing. From the lukewarm greeting to the rude checkout - it is definitely not the normal service I am used to receiving.

Positive: The location is convenient, the hotel room was clean, and quiet, even though we could see the freeway from our room. Plenty of parking. Nice amenities in the room - shampoo, conditioner, etc.

Negatives: The staff was not at all warm or hospitable. I am used to a lovely greeting, a Welcome or a Welcome back. I am used to being recognized as a Hilton Honors Member. The bathroom was not well maintained - the shower didn't work properly. Breakfast area was small and not well maintained. The staff was rude at checkout as well, even when I mentioned the problem there was not an apology. (She did say she would send maintenance to look at it)

This is not a bad property - it is just that the service - especially for Vegas - it just not hospitable! Not friendly and not what I have come to expect at a Hampton Inn.</p><br>Nice place...Great view<p>This hotel is dated. It is due for an update. That said, this hotel was clean and very comfortable. The staff was very friendly and the location was about 10 minutes from the strip. The breakfast was top shelf and something I had never seen before...they start serving at 5AM. I loved this being from the east cost. If you are looking for a good value for the money and a comfortable place to sleep this is a good location.
Room Tip: Asked to stay on the west wing. The freeway is quite busy and can be noisy.

Hold on to Maurice...he is Super I can't believe this review thing is like a test in college. i didn't put enough words in</p><br>Clean and Affordable<p>I really enjoy staying at the Hampton Inn in Summerville when I go to Vegas. It's away from the strip but you can get to LV Blvd and Downtown in 10 minutes. The hotel is clean, quiet and has lots of amenities at an affordable price.</p><br>Nice room for off the strip<p>Nice clean and quiet hotel when you need to be off the strip. Our business trips require we meet with customers in various regions of Las Vegas and we prefer to stay away from the strip. This hotel is very clean and well suited for small business groups or individuals.</p><br></body></html>
