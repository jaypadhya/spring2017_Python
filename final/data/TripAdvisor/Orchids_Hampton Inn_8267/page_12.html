Location a little farther north than I would have preferred. Front desk helpful. Comfortable beds. Ate breakfast elsewhere. Our room faced away from the freeway and was very quiet.
Room Tip: Hotel backs to freeway; if noise matters to you, suggest you ask for room which faces the other way.

The hotel is located next to a freeway and the sound of the freeway can be heard if you're facing the freeway when the A/C isn't on. This is a budget version of a Hilton property with a noisier HVAC unit which is louder than the freeway when it's on...

Check-in was a pleasure with a friendly and prompt check-in agent. Coffee, tea, and hot water is available all day in the lobby.

The room itself was surprisingly decent with a separate mini dining room area.

Water pressure in the shower was good. Bathroom amenities surprisingly included a shoe shine and shower cap too!

The bed was surprisingly comfortable for being a budget Hilton property.

Breakfast was decent as long as expectations are minimal.

~$70/night including tax and fees with Microwave, Fridge, no resort fee, free parking, free Wifi, free hot breakfast, and free snacks for being with Hilton Honors!</p><br>Good for busniess travelers<p>Booked this hotel last minute thinking it was in Summerlin, Nevada, but it is actually just at the tip of it and not near Summerlin proper. Furthermore, the exact location is not on the GPS which was really a problem. If you travel as a single woman I would avoid this place because of its general location and the outdoor parking area being very dark and foreboding, next to large vacant areas. The bed was well made and clean. The rugs in the walkways were filthy as are the ones in the room I occupied. Bring bottled waters and edibles for the evening as there is nothing near by to walk to and the drive to retail areas is a few minutes. Internet is free and easy to use. The hotel staff is excellent, very accommodating. This is a smoking hotel and you smell the ciggaretts throughout the common areas.
Room Tip: Make sure you get a room NOT that is no smoking and that does NOT face the 95 hwyway. Park near the...

Slow elevators. Beds not too bad but not great. Housekeeping was good. Grounds around hotel kept up well and always clean.
Room Tip: ask for a room near front of hotel and not facing freeway
See more room tips</p><br>Family<p>I am a frequent guest of this Hampton. The staff treats me like family and makes my business trip a bit more comfortable. Will only stay here while working in North Vegas. The service is extremely above par and i highly recommend this Hampton Inn.</p><br>Nice Place<p>We were here to visit family and did not want to intrude but wanted to be close by. The room was comfortable, bathroom was updated and clean, bed was very comfortable. Room was air conditioned already when we walked in. I'm very pleased and will probably make this my go to hotel in the future.</p><br>Excellent bargin!<p>We unexpectantly had to stay overnight in Summerlin and wanted to stay away from the strip..a quick expedia review search lead us to a few economical options but this hotel had best reviews.
Most important was cleanliness. And this hotel is one of the cleanest I have seen.
No weird cover up smells. No hairs in bathroom. It was clean.
Had nice toiletry selection in bathroom and even included a microwave and mini fridge.
The room and bathroom were also a good size.
The pool was nice but too cold for us and my 7 year old loved the little lap tray that she used to do her homework on while resting on the bed.
I will stay here again!</p><br>Great Hideaway<p>I enjoyed this location. It is definitely a break away from the strip and the hustle of the city. This is a secret hideaway and I enjoyed every minute of my stay! The food was great and I was able to get an excellent rate.</p><br>great bargain<p>nice job by Hampton inn rooms were very nice sized, bathroom well equipped, and water pressure very good. staff pleasant and helpful. and best of all the rates are very reasonable. under 100.00 per night. with a free breakfast buffet. and quiet away from the madness of the strip.</p><br>You get what you pay for<p>It's a simple hotel, located off the Strip in a very industrial part of Las Vegas. It's affordable, has the essentials, and nothing more. They don't have a restaurant, but they do offer a complimentary hot breakfast, which was nice. The food changed up slightly daily (different variation of omelets, etc), but it's nothing to rave about. Their seating area can also get pretty crowded. There is a small pool, gym, and business center. I was able to print out some things, but I think that it can get busy if there are a lot of people staying here. I suspect that a lot of people stay here if they are going to a conference and way to stay away from the hoopla of the Strip. However, if you don't have a car, you'll have to rely on delivery since there really isn't anything around the hotel, except for medical offices, health care businesses, etc.
We happened to be staying there when the BYU Lacross team came in, so it got a bit rowdy. We could hear them moving around in the rooms around us, and we had to wait a while for breakfast, as the staff needed to prepare more food.</p><br></body></html>
