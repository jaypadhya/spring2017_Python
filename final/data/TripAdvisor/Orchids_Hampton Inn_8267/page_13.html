Some road noise for rooms facing expressway. Nice, clean, daily breakfast buffet with outdoor seating, refrigerator, microwave, coffee, tea, fresh cookies at 7 PM, flat screen TV, HVAC, double beds X 2, extra pillows, 3 chairs, two tables, swimming pool, fresh towels and sheets daily (if you desire), nice fitness room with free weights dumbells (up to 50 lbs.), incline treadmill, elliptical trainer, recumbent bike, Absopure water, fresh towels, excercise and weight balls. There is a fitness trail about 1/4 mile away that is at least 3-4 miles long. Fairly near to Red Rock Canyon National Conservation area. No resort fees... need I go on?</p><br>Excellent value!<p>This Hotel is located in an business park next to I-95.The Hotel has three floors with interior elevator. Our room was at the rear of the hotel near the Interstate on the top (third) floor. It was QUIET with the hum of the air conditioner. To early for cookies and too late when we got back from the Vegas Strip (disappointed). They do have coffee service in the lobby 24 hrs. They and a small exercise room (for guests who want a full workout you can show your room key at Gold's Gym for a free visit), a coin operated laundry. For a person 5'2 the beds are too high. When I did get up into the bed the mattress was SO SOFT my feet felt like they were higher than my head. Plenty of pillows (four per bed). They have BOTH wired and wireless Internet. The swimming pool is off the lobby just off the breakfast area. The room had a 32''Flat screen TV, HBO and pay per view, a fridge, micro, and business center.The night stand has computer plug-ins and re-charge station. Our room had one wooden topped soft bottomed portable laptop table. You could sit in bed and use your laptop computer. This portable table is complete with elastic side bands to hold papers, GREAT room asset. Over the headboard were two lamps (one for each bed) that had wall switches next to bed to turn on/off. Three drawer dresser, small round table with two wood and upholstered chairs. Floor length mirror that has hinges that has hidden behind it the clothes hanging area. Upon entering the room I thought the only place to hand clothes was a small hook on the wall until further investigation of the room revealed this hinged mirror. Bathroom has a long nice vanity, four towel sets VERY SOFT and thick towels. Shower curtain, bottles of shampoo ,hair conditioner, lotion, shoe shine, shower cap, cotton swabs, cotton balls, ice bucket and coffee maker. Breakfast area gets crowed and hard to get around. The dining areas low tables were all take.. I had to sit at high bar stool type chairs around a long table. For again a 5'2 foot person had to get up on these chairs.</p><br>Just what I would expect<p>I have avoided Hampton Inns over the last 5 yrs as many have become somewhat run-down. This one is exceptionally nice and has renewed my interest in the chain. The front desk staff were exceptionally helpful. Besides recommending nearby restaurants/activities, they gave us complimentary snacks when we checked in. We were apparently upgraded as our room was extremely large. It was clean and nicely furnished. Overall, this hotel is an exceptional value.</p><br>Las Vegas Hampton near highway<p>Nice room. Large and clean.Helpful staff at the front desk.Breakfast was okay but not superior.None of the Sunday NFL games were on their TV. No snack bar that I could find. Would stay again but not on weekends when there are soccer games.</p><br>STAINS IN THE BATHTUB! REALLY RUN DOWN.<p>Excellent service and breakfast, clean room, very, very nice employees, however this facility attracts large soccer groups who clog up the breakfast service area and are loud at the tables, throw ice in the hallways and elevators, jump and run through the hallways and are not supervised properly. The rooms that face the highway are very noisy as the highway is right on the other side of the wall next to the hotel. If you don't care about the noise, it's great!</p><br>the best hotel ever!!!!<p>The first room we were put in had a large red/brown stain in the tub that looked like body fluids. We were scared to touch it. Called down to the front desk for another room and was told that the hotel was booked and there were no other rooms available. It was a Friday night but the parking lot was not even half full. My husband basically had to threaten to complain on social media and take pictures before we were called back 10 minutes later and moved to another room. I DO NOT appreciate being lied to. I DO NOT appreciate having to threaten the front desk staff for another room. Had my husband not threatened them, then we would have had to stay in the dirty room. We are Hilton HOnors members (gold), we have a Hilton credit card, we are Hilton Grand Vacations Owners as well. It appalled me that your front desk staff would lie to an honors member or any other paying customer for that matter, about being fully booked. In general this hotel needs an update as well. The furniture is scratched and banged up..the tile is cracked in the bathrooms; the caulking is cracked. Apparently the brown/red stain in the tub (about two inches around in diameter) was from "rust" per the front desk. Really? you would rent a room with such a stain/damage to paying customers? That room should be shut down and the tub redone before it is rented by any customer.</p><br>Nice hotel - let down by noise<p>We really enjoyed the Summerlin Hampton. It had the best breakfast, the best pool, the best staff. We were treated more than welcome by Candice Pinson. Our experience was very rememberable in having everything we needed or wanted for the time we stayed!!! We will surely tell everybody we know about the wonderful Hampton Inn in Summerlin!!</p><br>good hotel when Vegas is too expensive(any Saturday)<p>Stayed here for 4 nights. 1st night had a room overlooking the highway and had a noisy aircon unit, so didn't get any sleep. I complained the next morning and was moved to a great room with a diamond upgrade.
BUT - the room also had a very noisy aircon unit (it seems to not work and then start at full power at intervals waking you up if you are asleep) & in this room the mini fridge was not well and made a constant humming noise. So, not much sleep on the 2nd night.
Third night I slept with earplugs in which helped.
Final night, I moved the fridge and unplugged it - that was a great help.
It's a real shame as the staff are really great and real credit to the hotel (special thanks to Desiree) - always there with a friendly smile and to help. They were a great help with my late checkout
The property is spotless, room (apart from the noise) was very comfortable and the bed was very comfortable.
Breakfast was simple and nice.
Overall a very nice property so let down by these noise issues that I am leaving exhausted after 4 not great nights of sleep. I would have given fewer bubbles had it not been for the staff.
I don't think I will be back there.</p><br>Great Stay<p>Good place to stay.We stayed here on a Saturday because all of the Las Vegas casino rooms are very expensive on any given Saturday. Hence, this was still neas Vegas and away from the traffic. Everything was clean and in very good condition. My only issue was that I was expecting a foam top bed which ours was not. I must be spoiled.</p><br></body></html>
