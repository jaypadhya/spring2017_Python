<html><head><h3>Hampton Inn Las Vegas/Summerlin Hotel Reviews Page 16</h3></head><body><br>Typical good Hampton Inn reliability and quality<p>We had to make an unplanned visit to Las Vegas due to an illness of a family member. We were very happy with the location, which was close to the medical facility. The staff was very friendly and the hotel was typically Hampton, which is to say it was great. We've stayed at Hampton Inns throughout the country and this one matches up well with other ones we've stayed at. My only complaint, albeit a small one, was that the breakfast buffet area is too small and gets cramped.</p><br>Great Stay<p>This was the perfect location for us to get out of town on 95 in the morning and the rate was super. It's a 25 min. drive down to the Strip.
I like what they did with the breakfast area, very modern and more of an all purpose room.
There was a bit of confusion at check-in about what rooms had connecting doors or not, Our room on the top floor was comfortable and quiet, the refrigerator and microwave were stored in an attractive cabinet and worked well. It had a desk with an office chair and a table with two chairs. This is great for a couple with two computers! I would have preferred a room on the opposite side of the freeway but with the fan on and the windows closed, noise was not a problem, and we enjoyed a fantastic sunrise. Bathroom was plenty big with good towels and toiletries.
On our return about 10 pm there was a problem with our television and apparently with all local channels in the hotel. Felipe came to the rescue, he 'rebooted' the TV and we got the channels that mattered. He also helped us find the ice machine on the third floor which is tucked into the corner of the laundry room, there is no sign for it. The evening desk clerk had no clue.
Breakfast had plenty of choices and good coffee.
We had also enjoyed the pool in the afternoon.
Overall a great stay, would definitely stay here again, actually it was our 2nd one.
Room Tip: Top floor, hotel has an elevator as far away from the freeway as possible

The service was excellent, if I ever have a problem they fix it promptly and go the extra mile.</p><br>TravelinGrandpa<p>Staff Friendly and helpful. Very good breakfast with a hot and cold. Fresh fruit, yogurt. Rood was very comfortable. Pool area clean, fitness equipment up to date and useable. Hotel located close to everything I wanted and needed to get to.</p><br>EXCELLENT Hotel!<p>We stayed at this Hotel just by chance. Many other Vegas hotels were booked. Boy was it a happy mistake. Rooms were very comfortable and clean. Front desk was so friendly and helpful. Breakfast was awesome! I can't say enough about this hotel. And to top it of.......it was also a great price! The front desk even gave us a long list of places that deliver food right to the hotel. That was so great, we were much too tired to go out. Very helpful.</p><br>Nice to get away from strip<p>The staff was really friendly and made me feel welcome. They were very courteous. Beds were soft and clean. The Parking and access felt secure and safe. The Pool was comfortable and a Hot tub is available.</p><br>A great experience at Hampton Inn<p>We enjoyed staying at this Hampton Inn for one night. The place is very clean, not noisy, employees are pleasant and helpful. The lower floor was very convenient for accessing the breakfast room and other amenities and also close to the parking area. Overall a very nice stay!
Breakfast and evening cookies are great too!
Room Tip: Lower floor room was nice, not too noisy.

The rooms had a great bed , I had a stiff back when I arrived and actualy slept the best in a month.</p><br>Affordable<p>This Hampton Inn was very clean and comfortable and offered everything our family needed. Pool, exercise room, laundry and free hot breakfast. I have 4 pillows on each bed which is great since our family requires 2 pillows a piece. Air conditioning worked well and the hotel was quiet. Lobby staff was very helpful and quick to accommodate any needs.</p><br>Another Great Hampton Inn Experience!<p>In recent years I always stay in a Hampton Inn wherever I travel because for the price you really won't find a better overall hotel experience and courteous staff. This particular Hampton Inn is no exception, Summerlin is a great area not far from the strip and the property was in fabulous condition. Staff at the front desk couldn't be more helpful, especially miss Gabbie who always had a smile on her face and was more than accommodating. Highly recommend this Hampton Inn!</p><br></body></html>
