<html><head><h3>Hampton Inn Las Vegas/Summerlin Hotel Reviews Page 21</h3></head><body><br>Off the strip Las Vegas - great location<p>This Hampton Inn is located a little west of the strip in a business area, right next to a hospital. Wonderful location for fast food and grocery stores along the 95 Really liked the accomodations, staff and location</p><br>Excellent Service, above and beyond!!<p>I stay at Hampton Inn's often for work. From time to time you will see youth sports teams staying at the property. Some hotels handle this better than others. When you see several teams hit the breakfast room at the same time it is challenging to keep food stocked and things pick up and clean. This Hampton Inn handled it like a pro!! I took advantage of the nice patio next to the pool to get away from all the kids inside but I would go in from time to time to get something to eat or drink. It was always clean and items were always stocked. I've seen other hotels run out of everything and never clean up the mess until everyone leaves, not this hotel, they kept plugging away at it. The hotel is walking distance (maybe two blocks) to a nice pub with decent food and a great beer selection. Also I overheard the front desk helping out a guest, they were very pleasant and went out of their way to really help point the guest in the right direction. Top notch Hampton Inn!!! I would go back.</p><br>Excellent choice<p>Immaculate room, comfy bed, great room and property amenities. Used the pool and the fitness room which had a decent variety of equipment. In room coffee is actually good. Didn't try the morning meal. Will definitely be my first choice to stay in that area.</p><br>Wonderful Establishment<p>I had about 20 electrical outlets in my room and it was wonderful and I did not have to bend over to use them. I have stayed at numerous other hotels where I had to search for an outlet; only to find it behind the nightstand. The ladies behind the front desk were amazing and very helpful. Thank You for the wonderful establishment.</p><br>Super Place<p>wife and I stayed there 2 nights. great room, friendly staff, excellent breakfast, clean through out all the areas we used. You won't be disappointed. Also Aces and Ale's across the street great place to eat. food is well worth it and staff is friendly.</p><br>Least favorite Hampton Inn stay<p>I've stayed at Hamptons before, and my experiences have been overwhelmingly positive. Customer service is generally exceptional. Not at this Hampton. We were part of a larger group traveling for work. One person was in charge of the reservations. I'm sure he picked Hampton because of the proximity and price. A group of us checked in ahead of the rest. They didn't seem to have the organizer's card on file, so we each put our reservations on our own card. That seemed to stress Judy out more than anyone. There was 5 of us checking in, and it took forever! The gentleman that was helping us was fine, but Judy stood 2 feet away and just watched the entire process. She didn't help one bit. Very frustrating. The air conditioner in my room squealed every time it was cycling off. Hard to get a good night's rest. My room was clean, but very dated in d√©cor and furnishings. I generally use the exercise facilities, but the quality of the equipment was very poor. And limited. I know they offer access to Gold's Gym, but I did not have my own car, so that was not an option. A co-worker went to enjoy the hot tub, but when he saw it was green, he turned around and came back in. The breakfast was decent and probably the highlight of the stay. I would not stay here again.</p><br>Friendly Staff at check in<p>This hotel check in was the most friendliest I have ever had, Judy was on the check in desk was very friendly and most helpful.
The facilities in this well maintained hotel are of a high standard, I asked if there where any restaurants near by and was furnished with a list of 18 within walking distance and a little map to aid locating them, my room is clean and well laid out... What more could I ask for ....</p><br>Friendly staff makes the stay<p>This hotel seems to be recently updated. Everyone on the staff, from the front desk, to maintenance, to breakfast staff, were so helpful and friendly. Facilities were very nice. Warm cookies are provided in the afternoons, and an ample breakfast buffet in the morning. I'd stay here again.</p><br>Perfect Las Vegas location<p>Loved this smaller hotel! Price was reasonable. Breakfast was great. Evening cookies were delicious. Rooms were super clean. Beds were comfortable. Workout room and poll were suitable. Try and get a room away from the interstate.</p><br>Hampton Inn Summerlin Las Vegas<p>I thought that this hotel was good quality. The complimentary breakfast had a lot of options, healthy and filling. The pool was nice, and well taken care of. The room was clean and the room service was helpful and efficient. The check-in and check-out process was quick and worryless.</p><br></body></html>
