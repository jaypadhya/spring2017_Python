<html><head><h3>Holiday Inn Express Las Vegas Nellis Hotel Reviews Page 10</h3></head><body><br>Watch your invoice and credit card<p>After a 2+ week trip and staying at many nice hotels, including 3 other HIE (all of which were new, as was this one) was disappointed only after arriving home and checking credit card statements on line. The invoice left under our door the morning we were leaving showed the accurate charge of $84.67. Upon checking our credit card statement, we had been charged $112.67. An immediate call to the hotel brought about an explanation that the extra charge was........in case we had additional charges or damages.!!!!! And because we DID NOT, they would credit back the addition $28..
We are 2 Seniors, with cell phones, and the hotel has NO resturant! What charges were they anticiipating?
They did correct the billing but I am still left with the question of why this policy is different than every other HIE and one I have never experienced in 75 years.

The area has NO decent restuarants............which will make me more aware of location of any pre-planned reservations.</p><br>Ok for the area<p>Only stayed here because of the proximity to Las Vegas Motor Speedway. Hotel is nice enough but the area is not. Breakfast is free but not great and closes by 9:30 am on a weekend! Pool is very small and really cold. I left a clothing item in my room and called later that day about it. The man at the front desk was not at all helpful and would not let me check lost and found before we left. So had to leave them behind and I'm still trying to get it handled days later....called the hotel at least 4 times and no one seems to have the same story or the ability to help me get them shipped. Might try the La Quinta that is there as well. It is walking distance to a Wal-Mart and McDonalds</p><br>Good for a stopover.<p>I chose this hotel for a stopover on the way to Bryce Canyon as it was as far as I thought we could get since we were not leaving LA until late afternoon. The hotel was very clean, the 3rd floor hallway was smokey, but there was no smoke smell in the room. Loved the choice of pillows. The soundproofing was great, returning from getting ice I could here people in the room next door from the hallway, but once in the room it was silent. The pool was small, but my kids swam both before bed and in the morning and no one else was in the pool. Breakfast was okay, there was a good selection but hot food was not good - the eggs were rubbery and my kids wouldn't eat the sausages. I usually don't let them throw away food, but after I tasted thiers I had to agree. It would be better to just do a good
continental. Only real cons were no nightlight in the bathroom, the light was connected to the extrator so it as either pitch black or loud and bright, not good when traveling with kids; and a minor security issue - when my card wouldn't work after breakfast I went to the desk, the staff member there just said 'room number?' and rekeyed it. I had not spoken to her previously, and she did not ask my name or any identifying information. While I was happy to get back in my room, it made me wonder how easy it would have been for someone else to get access!</p><br>I definitely be back.<p>I've been to this Holiday Inn Express Twice before and I have always been greeted and treated like an extremely valued customer. On my last visit I did run across a problem that really could have happened to any one at any hotel. When I got my room it was warm and the air conditioner wouldn't turn on. I called the front desk and I was given to option to wait for the air conditioner to be serviced or get another room. I liked that I was given the option because sometimes you have a great room with a great view and then you lose it because you weren't given the option to simple wait for a while. However I decided to get another room and by the time I got down stairs to return my key card I had already been upgraded to a better room and my new key card were there waiting for me. The front desk was very prompt and very helpful.</p><br>Excellent rooms, very clean. Very friendly staff.<p>I want to say thank you to all the staff that helped us out the 2 days we stayed, To start Zenina was very friendly,proffesional and very informative when I checked in, she was great she even signed me up for they priority club rewards program.The entire staff was also very friendly. The rooms were top notch I felt as if I was staying in a luxury hotel at a fraction of the cost, the rooms were so spacious and very very clean, that was my major concern in finding a place for my family. Their beds were so comfortable I did not want to leave; they also have a pool and jaccuzzi. I would definitely stay here again. Thank you guy's.

We go to the NHRA drag races every April and October and we really wouldn't stay anywhere else. The hotel is only about 5 minutes from the dragstrip, so that's perfect for us. The staff is always so nice and welcoming. The rooms are large, clean and comfortable. The breakfast bar is just right, if you're not needing a full-on hot breakfast. They have a good variety and the little cinnamon rolls are killer! There are no restaurants within walking distance, but there are several within a few minutes drive. The neighborhood is not the greatest, but in all the times we've stayed there, we haven't had a single problem whatsoever. We wouldn't consider staying anywhere else for our trips to the drag races.</p><br>Great and friendly at a great price!<p>Great hotel with friendly staff. Will be back again</p><br>Best hotel I have stayed at<p>When I walked through the door we were greated enthusiastically, I felt like they genuinely cared for me. We forgot a few items and when I called down to see if they could bring them up to me we got them within 5 minutes, at most other hotels you get it in 30 minutes (If they don't forget) . The room was gorgeous, had beautiful marble counter tops and a really comfortable bed. The breakfast was great too! Had such a huge variety. We will definetly be coming back.</p><br>Great place to stay<p>We stayed here for two nights on a trip to Las Vegas. The location is decent. I was worried after reading some previous reviews, but there are many cameras located in the parking lot of the hotel. The hotel is very clean and comfortable. It's about 4 miles from the Las Vegas strip, but we had no problems getting to and from the strip. The staff was awesome! Great place to stay if you're in Vegas.</p><br>I loved it &amp; I will be back.<p>Clean, friendly, ready to serve.
Bit of drive to where I need to be but IT IS WORTH THE DISTANCE.
I didn't have to walk thru the smoke and noise to get to the room.
Problem was I did not want to leave the room to take care of my business.
I just wanted to stay & enjoy the quite clean room.</p><br></body></html>
