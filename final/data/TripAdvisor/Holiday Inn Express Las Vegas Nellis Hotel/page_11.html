<html><head><h3>Holiday Inn Express Las Vegas Nellis Hotel Reviews Page 11</h3></head><body><br>The best holiday inn express ever!<p>Stayed here after flight from UK on route to Zion national park Utah.
Booked two rooms with hotel reward points, so was no stranger to the holiday inn brand.
The hotel was fresh and felt new, the staff were very friendly and helpful.
Big TV with plenty of channels, Very clean and well kept, the only disappointment was the pool was closed.
The free breakfast was very nice with plenty of choice.
I would stay again, Very good.</p><br>Great location at a reasonable price<p>Last stop on a relocation move from the midwest. Not close to the action, but I was not looking for that this time. Stayed Memorial Day Monday night. Place only had 5 other rooms rented. Went in without a reservation. Started to walk out when I was quoted a price higher than I wanted to pay. As I went to leave the price dropped from $89 to $73. Room was clean, pool and whirlpool were clean and relaxing. Only negative was the automatic pancake maker in the morning. Pancakes came out like rubber. Otherwise I would not hesitate staying here again.</p><br>Best Value in North Las Vegas!<p>This is a great hotel! Best one in the area in my opinion. It's clean, has friendly professional staff and it's absolutely comfortable! Great breakfast too! If you're in the North Las Vegas area, do yourself a favor and stay at this hotel. I have stayed here several times and it's great every time! When ever I'm in the area that's where I will stay for sure. Great price too! The jet planes at the near by Air Force Base do not fly at night so it's quiet.</p><br>Nice hotel in a seedy area and lying staff<p>The bathrooms and rooms are pretty nice. The staff promised me over the phone and when I got to the hotel that they had a great washer -dryer for guest use. Great, right? Especially when you are on a road trip. When I wake up in the morning to do my laundry, the washer has an "out of order" sign on it. Apparently it's been out of order for a while. The lady at the front desk proceeds to play verbal judo with me and give me non-answers about why no one told me this when I checked in the night prior. She gave me $12 off my $82 room (big whoop). I still couldn't do my laundry. Also the area is super seedy - we were told my staff to literally take everything out of the car or else...</p><br>Seriously the best hotel we've experienced.<p>We've stayed in hotels across the U.S. and in many countries around the world, and the Holiday Inn Express Las Vegas Nellis ranks up there with the best. The rooms were modern, clean, very well equipped, and very comfortable (beds and pillows were wonderful). The complimentary breakfast was varied, well-prepared, and delicious. The hot food was hot and the cold (milk, juice, etc) was cold. But what impressed us most were the staff members we came into contact with. The check-in staff made us feel like they really cared about us. They made us feel at home (the warm cookies helped) and perked us up after a long day on the road. The breakfast room attendant was very helpful and made sure we found what we were looking for. We plan to make this a regular stop when we're in Vegas.</p><br>Clean, friendly, will stay again for certain!<p>Clean facility, easy parking, very nice staff, reliable breakfast. This is a top notch staff with an excellent hotel. We were there for Nascar race and we are military, so we found the location within minutes of the track and within minutes of the base to be perfect. Walmart just up the road and easy route to freeway. 20 minute freeway run to the strip in traffic, but trip back to hotel much faster without traffic. Free high speed internet worked without a hitch every time we needed it. The staff greeted us every time we entered or exited, so it felt very much like a home and we felt very welcome. The room was very clean and it was maintained very well by staff every day. Bedding and bath towels were clean and comfortable. Fitness center small, but had plenty of equipment and right there by the elevator for easy use. My husband left his shoes and we called when we got home. They mailed them to us (at our cost as we expected) without a problem and saved us from a big loss, as they were specialized shoes. We will return to this hotel.</p><br>Excellent service and pleasant atmosphere<p>We would like to express our thanks to the manager, Eric for his pleasant and helpful attitude during our stay at the Holiday Inn Express Las Vegas Nellis. Eric displayed excellent customer service to all his guests and it made our stay very enjoyable. We also appreciated the cleanliness and comfort of this hotel and would stay again when in the area. Thank you!</p><br>More than expected!<p>This newer Holiday Inn Express was a very pleasant surprise, as they seem to have done everything right! Beginning with my check-in, I was indeed awarded a 'gift bag' for being a "priority club" member, and all the ammenities were explained in detail... such as the heated jacuzzi, the excercise room, the free full breakfast hours, etc.
Once to my room, it was extremely clean and large. The desk for my laptop was oversize and had both wired and wireless available, the bedding was typical for the newer HI (very comfortable, with firm and soft pillows), and the bath was a cut above most!
I then found the location was not as far away from the "strip" as I had thought... just a block north, then a left turn.. about 5 miles to the Freemont Experience (well worth the trip, even if you don't want to gamble) and plenty of restaurants within that drive.
The breakfast was more than a continental - they had egg omelets each morning, with either sausage or bacon (rotating, I presume) and biscuits, gravy, cereals, milk, juices, pastries... all free (many now like to offer the very basic, charge for the meat and eggs!)
Overall, a wonderful experience, and I will certainly stay there again next time I get to Vegas.
BTW-if you're miliary, Nellis AFB is just around the corner!</p><br>was okay<p>Not in the best area..but low noise and was okay ..not too bad.
bathrooms were spotless and service was actually very nice.
Parking was also easy. I liked this place. Not a palace lol..but slept well.I moved to Vegas, and was cheap will finding housing!!</p><br>The perfect hotel for competing in Las Vegas<p>We brought our nitro Funny Car team to Las Vegas to compete in the Rockabilly Rod Reunion May 2010 and the Holiday Inn Express not only supported us with a performance award the rate was unbeatable, the rooms perfect for getting much needed rest after a full days work at the race track. We loved the experience and will always look to stay at a Holiday Inn Express. So close and easy to the race track plus plenty of parking for our rigs.</p><br></body></html>
