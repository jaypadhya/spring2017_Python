<html><head><h3>Holiday Inn Express Las Vegas Nellis Hotel Reviews Page 2</h3></head><body><br>Great Service!<p>Stayed here for one night. It is not close to the strip, but I was visiting relatives, so it didn't matter to me. I was really impressed by the service at the front desk, which was as good as anywhere I've been.</p><br>Decent place far from the Strip<p>The Holiday Inn chain is great - decent amenities for decent price;they have never disappointed us at any property; and we have stayed at quite a few across the US. This place is no different with good breakkie, good rooms and a decent location. The pillows could be better - too soft - but otherwise all good.</p><br>Bucket List Vacation<p>We always stay at this chain. It's always clean and the staff are very kind and helpful. This particular location was perfect for what we were looking for. It was located between the Drag Strip and the Vegas Strip. The woman at the front desk gave us the best recommendation for dinner that we could have asked for. (Memphis Championship...
More </p><br>Served the purpose, nothing memorable.<p>I was in town on a hurried trip from Arizona to attend a wedding and the location was conveninent to where I needed to be. The hotel is nice enough, although frankly I get kind of bored with chain motels Breakfast was pretty good, but after a day or two of these, I would go eat somewhere else. The staff...
More </p><br>An unexpectedly nice place on the edge of Vegas<p>Everything about the hotel was very nice. I stayed there five nights and enjoyed it thoroughly from the nice sized room, the cleanliness, the friendliness of the staff to the pleasant breakfast. Everyone was helpful, especially a very thoughtful employee at the front desk named Donna. The bed was luxurious and even the lighting was better than usual. No burned...
More </p><br>Great Hotel with Reasonable Rate<p>The staff at the hotel is friendly and helpful. The rooms are nice and very clean but what I really like is that the beds are so comfortable! Complementary Wi-Fi and breakfast with choices for everyone! Away from the Vegas strip, but not too faraway!</p><br>Pleasant Stay but Hotel a Bit Old<p>Stayed here passing through on a road trip. It was a bit out of the way off the highway, so location was not great. The property is a bit old, and our room smelled a bit old. It was a bit humid and musky in it, but we just slept. Morning breakfast was average.</p><br>Unexpected stay, unexpected comfort<p>I stayed for one very short, unexpected night lately and was very surprised at the hospitality and comfort of the room. The helpful man on the front desk late at night was quick to find me a suitable room, and he made sure to point out out the free pancakes available all evening. Breakfast was adequate and much appreciated. Although...
More </p><br>Exactly what I needed<p>We were on a cross country road trip and tried to book all nights at holiday inn express'. This one was exactly what I've come to expect out of an overnight stay hotel. I need a cart for luggage, a pleasant and efficient check-in staff, easy access to restaurant carry-out or delivery (we brought our dog) pet-friendly access, clean, large...
