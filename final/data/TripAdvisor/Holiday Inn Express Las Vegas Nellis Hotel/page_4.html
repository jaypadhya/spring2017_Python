<html><head><h3>Holiday Inn Express Las Vegas Nellis Hotel Reviews Page 4</h3></head><body><br>Excellent Customer Service :-)<p>We found ourselves unexpectedly delayed in Vegas. There was an air show in town & without a reservation we felt lucky to find decent accommodations last minute. A quick check & we discovered rates closer to the action were almost double what we paid @ HIE. We weren't on vacation so not looking for resort facilities or easy access to the strip, etc. Given some of the reviews we were a little wary, however our stay was WONDERFUL !!! The room was spotless ~ triple sheets on comfortable beds with lots of pillows. Granite counters & shower walls. Fridge/micro, large flat screen TV. Rounded corner desk area was a great place to spread out paperwork, eat, etc. Free wifi with enough signal to stream Netlfix. Continental breakfast was well tended & grounds were nicely manicured. Staff was professional & everyone went out of their way to be helpful: kudos to Angie, Saska & special thanks to Paz @ housekeeping. Wouldn't hesitate to stay here again. Note: Given the heat of the day (it was over 100 degrees the weekend we stayed) and the fact that Nellis Ave is a bus line might explain some of the pedestrians aka "sketchy characters" another reviewer saw at night...but the parking lot was well lit and we felt our vehicles were secure.</p><br>not that great<p>My family stayed at this hotel at the beginning of a very long road trip.

We wanted to stay away from the strip and close to the freeway. The surrounding area of this hotel is TERRIBLE. We arrived around 10pm on a weekday and there were alot of sketchy characters walking around near the hotel.

When we checked in the girl at the front desk couldn't find my reservation initially. After about 10 minutes, she finally found it, we checked in and headed up to our room. We walked into our room and it REEKED of smoke (even though this is a smoke free establishment). I called downstairs and was given a new room. The second room smelled fine, but the beds were awful. They were old and sagging.on the sides, so much so that when my girlfriend sat on the bed she nearly fell off. They were unstable and shook whenever you would move. It made it very difficult to sleep.

In the morning before breakfast I spoke with the front desk about the issue with my reservation the previous night. To which the girl replied "well we're all new here." It seemed strange to have an all new staff with no one there to help, or train them properly.

The a/c worked well and the breakfast in the morning was decent. The fitness center was small, but nice and very clean.</p><br>Okay hotel, be careful of surrounding area.<p>We stayed two nights at this Holiday Inn Express, but were disappointed. Upon entering our room there was obvious fragrance of room deodorizer! The room and bathroom were clean and the bed was comfortable, not sure why it required the room deodorizer. The hotel is in a rather remote area which is not convenient to restaurants. Breakfast was the usual fare with scrambled eggs, sausage, juice, coffee, breads, and yogurt. Also the area is sketch saw several woman "working" the parking lot and street at night. We also saw several people hop the fence from the hotel into the apartment complex south of the hotel. If you don't mind that and are looking for an overnight stay away from the busy Las Vegas strip - this will work. Lastly the hotel lobby and staff were pleasant.</p><br>Long Distance from the Busy Strip and Not a Perfect Location for Vacation<p>Location:
I got this deal from Hotwire with a 95% Recommend Feedback Score. I was expecting/hoping another hotel that match the same description Hotwire listed. Long-store short, It turned out to to be this hotel. When I saw the location and the surrounding areas from Google maps I knew this was not going to be pleasant at all and the true actual driving time from the strip is a 30 - 40 minute drive. As I got closer to the hotel I looked around the area, and it is literately a deserted place with empty plot of land from each store, and excess amount non-sense billboard ads from politicians in every block. I would not recommend people with children to stay near this location.

Hotel:
Just like all Holiday Inns, it is simple and basic. I got Free Wi-fi, Breakfast, and Parking. All of that worked out well and the room was clean and had everything in place with no compliant. The Breakfast was mediocre, but hey can't beat free. Other than that, it was what I expected and I got what I needed for my 1-day trip.

Conclusion:
I would NOT Stay here for more than 1-day, because of the location. I would of enjoyed my trip a lot better staying closer to the strip, but it is what it is, and I had a good time with my family and everything worked out.I knew what to expect before hand and was not surprised by the location.</p><br>Not my cup of tea.<p>This location is very clean, however location does not weigh out. Horrible area for a Holiday Inn Express. There were none during my stay (that I know of), but there were long-term military there speaking about what goes on in the area. If you have children, FORGET IT! You would be better off being closer to the strip with more "traffic." Every time I passed the desk, there was a sign up, instead of a person. The people that DID stand behind the desk did not look like they belonged there, even what they would call a Manager. Poor service considering the brand and area. Very disappointing.</p><br>Great quiet, clean, &amp; comfortable rest spot!<p>We stayed here on our way to Bryce Canyon and it was a perfect spot to relax away from the strip in North of Vegas. They had a cozy pool area. The room was clean and spacious and easy access to our car since we needed our cooler. It is a family-friendly atmosphere. The beds are comfortable and it had everything we needed. The free breakfast was very good.</p><br>Perfect When You Want To Avoid the Strip!<p>We stayed here on our way from Zion Nat'l Park to Lake Tahoe and I really didn't want to stay down on the strip. This is close to Nellis, so there was some activity with planes (jets and Carriers) taking off, but we didn't mind because they stopped before we went to sleep and... Well, they are cool to watch! The hotel was very nice and in a great location! This is one I highly recommend!</p><br>Never. Again.<p>No A/C! Do you really need any other information than that? No A/C in 100 degree heat in Arizona. GMAFB!

Room 232
(It's an accessible room, but I was desperate so I took it.) I came into a room that was almost as hot as my car. I was told that it would cool down. Never happened. When I requested to switch rooms the temperature in the room had reached 85 degrees! Maintenance staff had left for the day when I called about the A/C. So I guess if there is ever an emergency, you would be screwed at this hotel. Good to know.

Room 132
(Another accessible room, but even worse as it doesn't have a tub.) Cool at first, but when I got back from dinner, vent was no longer blowing cool air. Sigh... The hallways were also very hot. The thermostats in the hallways were also on the coolest setting and the fans were running on high as well. So it wasn't just my room that was hot as hell.

Now I have to stay out all night in a casino to get A/C. Pathetic is the only word to describe my experience. And there is nowhere else in the hotel to seek refuge. The business center, lobby, and gym are also hot as hell.

Contacted Priceline for a refund. Still waiting to hear back. Priceline is dreadful in all the ways that count.

Front desk staff was pleasant, very helpful, and accommodating. The hotel was sold out for the night. So I was stuck with a room that was getting hotter by the minute.

This hotel is near an Air Force base so be prepared for very loud training exercises. In addition, this hotel is well beyond the Strip and would not be a good location if you are planning to gamble, have fun, or be near anything.

I will never stay here again. I am trying to find another hotel as I write this review.

I cannot understand why a newer hotel would still have mercury thermostats. Get digital thermostats instead. "Cool" is a relative term. (What straight guy thought it would be a good idea to put the word "cool" on a thermostat instead of an actual number? A dumb***. That's what kind! And why would you have a unit where the fan runs all the time? What a waste of energy!)

I am over it...
Room Tip: Ask for a room with A/C that works.

This one was very well located, a very few miles from Las Vegas itself. It was very easy to find, located on a main road, close to a petrol station and some fast food places, so easy to get something to eat.
The rooms were fine and the free WiFi worked well, a bonus of being in the Rewards programme.
Breakfast provided good variety and we felt well looke after.
Would recommend.</p><br>Excellent<p>I always stay with Holiday Inn - I know I am getting the same stay - never disappointed - great services - especially when traveling with my pet. I have found friendly personal at every stay throughout the USA.</p><br></body></html>
