<html><head><h3>Holiday Inn Express Las Vegas Nellis Hotel Reviews Page 3</h3></head><body><br>WAY overpriced for what it offers<p>To begin, keys didn't work. Then, no blackout drapes, exhaust fan in bathroom was incredible LOUD. Room was cold upon arrival, turned heat ALL the way to high......NEVER warmed the room. Motel 6 level hotel, with Holiday Inn Express level prices. BIG mistake. TOO many hotels in the area for MUCH cheaper. Won't be returning here.
Room Tip: Sure.......choose another hotel

Meeting room also very nice for small conference. Please notes casino not far away but not a good part of town. Do not go out at night.</p><br>Comfortable Room and Helpful Staff!<p>I spent three days and two nights here during a conference and was very pleased! The desk staff were all very friendly and helpful. This was especially appreciated because the first day I was there, the swipe card machine was down and all guests needed to be let into their rooms by someone from the desk! They sure got their exercise that day!

The bed was very comfortable and the room was clean and well stocked with coffee and teas.

The only downside to the stay was due to the hotel's location next to Nellis Air Force Base. So there was a lot of jet noise and the bugle call for reveille was at 6:30 AM.

The self-serve breakfast buffet was simple and very nice. In addition to the cold items, they also had hot eggs, bacon and biscuits. It was a lot nicer than just a continental breakfast you get in so many hotels.

Also helpful was the small but adequate traveler's office with PC and printer; great for printing your boarding passes!</p><br>Nothing Special<p>I used a rewards night as I was on the road for a vacation. The registration area was nicely decorated for the holiday season. I was used to being welcomed at HIE as a platinum cardholder / preferred member. However, things may have changed since Priority Club disappeared, to be replaced by the more generic IHG rewards. Clerk was respectful but not particularly welcoming. Bed was okay. Room was okay. Breakfast was okay. When I checked out, I asked for a receipt to make sure there were no charges. I got a receipt that indicated a $25 charge. The clerk said that's what the hotel gets from IHG. She couldn't give me a receipt indicating that I had not been charged. We'll see what my credit bill says.</p><br>Holiday Express - North vegas (Nellis AFB)<p>Very nice Holiday Exp. Just a short drive down Craig Rd to Nellis from the 15 FWY. Restaurants & shopping walking distance. The staff was very friendly & more importantly the place was very clean. The rooms are nice sized.. Internet works perfectly (even with 3 devices at once). This location has a nice breakfast (breads, fruit, bacon, sausage, cereals, milk/coffee/juice & fresh pancakes & mini egg/cheese omelettes. The have a small outdoor heated pool which was warm even in the current chilly weather & they have an indoor hot tub right next to the pool. This is a great place to stay away from the bustle of downtown Vegas but only a 10-15 min drive to the strip.</p><br>Business Trip OK<p>This is a basic run of the mill hotel and does what it need to do. Rooms were clean and tidy. Breakfast is included but its the usual quick on the go menu of basic American foods. Coffee on the house most of the day and close to Nellis AFB for ease. Staff ranged from really friendly to average depending on who was on duty when I arrived back. Stayed here for over a week, and that was pushing the limits to be honost.</p><br>Stay Away--High Crime District<p>My car was parked outside the front door under parking lot lamps. The car was broken into by shattering driver side window. Stolen was a GPS Unit, 2 pairs of prescription sunglasses, value at $850 replace cost. My comprehensive has $1,000 deductible, so the replacement of the window cost us an extra 10 hours in Las Vegas (we were on our way to Lake Havasu, AZ. My Personal Possessions theft insurance also has a $1,000 deductible. I am out over $1,200, plus time lost.

The hotel has a 24-hr surveillance camera and the night clerk is supposed to walk around the building as part of their duties. We came outside at 10:00am and no one had reported this yet to the front desk. Who was doing their job? Moreover, we found out at the police station that a Jeep has also been broken into that night. This area is a high crime district.

The only saving grace for the GM of this hotel was that a maintenance person was dispatched and helped us clean up the broken glass in the car before we drove to the nearby LV Police Station and spent another 1.5 hours filling in a Car Theft form; and then 4 hours at the local Honda dealer getting the window replaced.

If the anti-theft cameras do not work in the dark, then the thieves know this. Do not provide false confidence and hope to customers when the tool does not work.</p><br>Close to Nellis AFB, Good Service<p>Our visit to this location was pleasant. The location is great if you are visiting Nellis AFB, as it is a few blocks from the main gate. It's not for visitors going to the strip. I believe this location started as a non-Holiday Inn Express property, but it has been transformed into one. The location offers a large breakfast area which was well stocked over the weekend we were there. Cookies, fruit and water in the evening. The location also offered an outdoor pool, hot tub and workout equipment area. The staff was super friendly. Parking was never an issue and the side lot offered room for vehicles with trailers.

The room included a good sized flat screen TV with plenty of HD cable channels. Also included was a fridge and microwave. The bathroom was enclosed and a good size. The shower head was standard HI Express and there was plenty of hot water. The air conditioning was quiet and constant, but the thermostat was older and not the usual digital temperature read out, so we had to play around to get the right temp.

The mattress was older and not pillowtop as many HI Express locations have. The Firm and Soft pillows and usual linens were there.

Items I wish the hotel would improve upon:

- Automatic opening doors to help with wheeling in luggage (I didn’t see handicapped access, but it could have been there).
- Our room on the second floor was right next to one of the parking lot lights. The room darkening drapes didn’t work too well. If you need a dark room, you may want to consider a third floor room.
- Our second floor room heard a lot of floor squeak from our neighbors walking in their room on the third floor.

Overall, a good visit.</p><br>Good for what it is<p>This is a holiday inn express about 10 miles from the strip really more for access to Nellis AFB and the surrounding area of Vegas. Hotel is clean typical Holiday Inn express, have a nice breakfast with cinnamon rolls and a pancake machine. Room felt a bit dark/ dreary but overall a great visit.</p><br>Good hotel<p>Visited with family nice hotel. House kèeping is very good. Free parking. Value for money little far , limited options in break fast, you can't find adopter arrange yourself as asian switches are different. Reception staff is good</p><br></body></html>
