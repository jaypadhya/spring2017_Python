Most people will stay at one of the big casinos right on the strip. Thank God she booked us here!! As much as I love going out and having fun, it was incredibly nice to leave the hectic energy from the strip, get away from all the hype/loud music/drunken people and come back home to a nice quiet place away from the scene! The service was great. They provide shuttles back and forth to the strip. The place was also a lot more high end than I thought a holiday inn would be! very pretty. We loved our room and the facilities in the hotel. I found that the crowd that stayed here was usually people on business or flight attendants. I will def stay here again if I return to Vegas :)</p><br>Very Nice place and on the edge of being in the middle of it!<p>The staff was great. Really went out of there way to make it a great stay. The room was very clean, breakfast was fine. A very nice place to stay that is a little ways out from the fast pace.
Will stay there again.
Room Tip: Pick the King roon over the Standard one

Price was reasonable too. Non smoking hotel. We arrived late at night so they extended our stay until 2pm so we could sleep in. Great place not to far off freeway 15 as well!</p><br>A great place to stay when you are in that part of town<p>Great service/also staff very helpful room are extra large with plenty of room also the rates are at a good price can't say much more would stay there again have .have stayed there in the past. Iam not much of person who has a lot of words to say but your review just dose not know when to stop asking they want at least 200 letters I just want to submit this with wright a book ,sorry I thank they want to much</p><br>Comfortable, convenient, quiet<p>I stayed at this location to attend NASCAR races at Las Vegas Motor Speedway. I could not have chosen a better location. It was 3 miles from the race track, and between that and our preferred parking it took us a total of 15 minutes each way between the hotel and the parking lot- on a raceday with 100,000 other fans there! I was greeted upon check-in by very friendly staff (even saluting my alma mater for me when they saw my out-of-town address). The room was clean, comfortable, and incredibly quiet. I stayed 2 nights, and every room was sold out, and I never once heard a sound from any other guest the entire stay. No noise from outside, either, from the track or the Air Force base nearby. Breakfast was good both mornings. It did take 30 minutes to drive to the Las Vegas Strip, so if that is part of your trip, keep that in mind. It was an easy drive, but somewhat time consuming because of traffic.
Room Tip: I was on the 2nd floor, in an odd numbered room, and there was a building security light on the wall...

Room Tip: All rooms were great.

Being from out of the area we relied on the front desk to guide us around Las Vegas. In town for the NASCAR races, we too, wanted to see the sights and eat some good food. Front desk staff was quick to help with recommendations and directions, so, we were able to make the most of our stay!! Breakfast in the mornings was great and definitely saved us some money. Will stay here again next year for the races.</p><br>Nicer Holiday Inn Express in Shady Area<p>This Holiday Day Inn Express is very clean and well presented. Rooms have an internal A/C, not like most HIE with a hole in the wall style, which if your near a busy road makes the room very noisy. So the rooms at this HIE are very quiet and well insulated from outside noise. My only slight grip with the rooms is that they are highly perfumed and this was a little overpowering initially. The area as some have noticed is a bit sketchy, however it's ok, I wouldn't go walking at night by myself! However if your business is on this side of Vegas, it's perfectly acceptable.</p><br>Great Rooms and helpful staff!<p>The rooms are good sized and always very clean. Great breakfast and a very friendly staff. You only have the craziness of the strip when you want it and when you ready for some rest and quiet, escape back to your comfy room!</p><br>Great hotel.<p>First off: only 4 stars b/c of location-but we knew this. It is not a pretty area or close to the action but we got to the strip in less than 20 minutes easily.That said, as budget-minded folks with young kids who travel to LV regularly, this hotel had everything we wanted & needed: in-room fridge, in-room micro, very satisfying breakfast buffet, heated pool, jacuzzi, & ample towels. On-site washer/dryer (there was only 1 of each, luckily no one was using it when we needed it), close to Wal Mart, McD's, and other eateries close by. The inside parking lot felt safe enough. On top (3rd?) floor: clean room, clean & ample space in bathroom, ample towels, ample toiletries, bedding not totally bedraggled. Clean coffee pot, working hairdryer. Comfortable enough bed. Yes, I could hear some folks through the walls but not esp. bothersome. Folks allowing their room doors to slam was worse (hotels can't stop the rudeness of people). No probs w/free WiFi. Sufficient TV channels. Didn't use gym but looked useful. Nice sitting lounge with TV next to lobby. Very friendly staff. We had one issue where our fridge leaked out water but it continued to keep items cool so I just put a towel under it & told the clerk so we didn't get noted for any damage, he came to our room & said he'd take note of that in our record since we agreed to keep it for sake of ease. Like all of the hotels our family has ever been to, the wall unit AC/heat was a bit noisey but not the worst I've ever heard. For the money, you can't get a room as accomodating as this one the strip, esp. during holiday wkd. I would stay here with my family again.
Room Tip: They were accomodating in our request to not place us too close to the elevator to reduce travel noi...
