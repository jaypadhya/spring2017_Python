<html><head><h3>Holiday Inn Express Las Vegas Nellis Hotel Reviews Page 6</h3></head><body><br>Slightly away from the brightest lights, but great value!<p>We spent one night here during a weekend trip to Las Vegas and I wouldn't hesitate to stay again, even though it's a few miles off the strip area.
The room was really spacious and well air conditioned; much needed in Las Vegas! There was a fridge and also free wifi, both of which are must haves for us.
The hotel seems pretty new and was very clean.
There's a pool and an indoor spa with seating and towels. Absolutely lovely!
Breakfast was a little busy, but I guess we picked a busy time. There was lots to choose from, including hot foods, toast, bagels, eggs, muffins, jams etc.
Looking forward to visiting again. Thank you to the staff!</p><br>I've never seen a bed so perfect!<p>The room was immaculate and the bed was so perfectly streched and made that it looked fake! Very comfy too. The housekeeping team was always smiling and greating you, you rarely see that. Would definitely stay here again!
Room Tip: Don't rely on Cabs in this area.

Schedules changed as they often do, and I needed to cancel my second night and move to a different hotel. Cherish and Leilani were very accommodating even though my change was very last minute and on the fly. Great people, would definitely go back.</p><br>Clean and Comfortable<p>Although this hotel is not in the best part of town, it is however a very relaxing and comfortable stay with shopping and food nearby. The staff are all very friendly and helpful and Linda is an especially pleasant host. I stay at this hotel a few times a week and I can tell you that it is the better choice among the nearby alternatives.</p><br>Flop<p>My husband I recently stayed at this hotel and was very displeased. Pool was loaded with bugs, per the desk clerk the pool man had just been there but by the looks of this there was no evidence of such a visit, jacuzzi was not heated and trying to relax and unwind after a long roadtrip in cold water this just was not happening. Asked the desk clerk about this and he said it was because no one had used it and to check back in a hour and it would be warm. Well I checked and it was still cold! When checking out the luggage trolley could not be located, I really don't think any of the staff even bothered to try to locate it, we were on the third floor and this would have been a big help taking the luggage down and mind you it wasn't around when we checked in either. Breakfast consisted of some sort of egg substance, instant pancake material and no fresh fruit! If you just want to flop this is the place don't expect the amenities to be clean and working! You would think that for the price $100+ per night after taxes that things would be better.The only good thing I can say about the room is that it was clean and the A/C was adequate. I don't think that we will stay here again!
Room Tip: No luggage trolley and pool/spa not clean or working!

I had to remind the front desk clerk, who was very nice, that I was a rewards member and should have received a welcome bag. I did get the bag with a bottle of water and some dandruff shampoo. I then had to spin a wheel to get an extra "prize". This seemed kinda cheezy to me. I understand each HI is going to be different, but would expect some things to stay the same. The last 3 HI's we were at had complimentary cookies in the evenings. HI - Nellis had a wheel to spin.

While I had forgotten to mention this about the previous hotel, I had booked all these stays online, months in advance. They had all my information ready to go when I arrived, which has been great. What I can't seem to understand is why when I indicate 4 people in a room, we find there to me only 3 large towels. Be sure to check that if you are a family staying at one of these hotels.

Overall I had a funny vibe about this stay and expressed it as much to the staff. They were very gracious about it, but since I told about it just before leaving they were nothing they could do at the time.</p><br>Linda and Jennifer are amazing hosts and extremely accommodating!<p>I can't say enough about the fantastic experience I had staying here. When I left my ID in a cab they were quick to pull up security feed and help me identify the cab company... At 4 in the morning. While it was a good distance from the main strip, I will likely be staying here again due to the more than fair rates and outstanding service! Thank you Jennifer and Linda for everything!</p><br>Excellent customer service<p>My husband and I booked early and got a discount. Today, as I checked my account, I got a $22 fee. We are both very honest individuals and took nothing in regards to pillows or towels. The door lock was broken when we got there and the sink faucet was skewed for who knows what reason. We have no idea if this is a parking fee, but I am angry...</p><br>Honest review of Holiday Inn Nellis<p>It was very easy to obtain a room. The customer service was above and beyond great. LEILANI took extra time to show us different rooms, the different areas of the hotel, and was extremely patient. She is very cheerful, friendly, and knowledgeable. If you want caring staff, it's here!</p><br></body></html>
