<html><head><h3>Holiday Inn Express Las Vegas Nellis Hotel Reviews Page 9</h3></head><body><br>Awesome and Automatic Pancake Maker lol<p>I went to EDC this past weekend and stayed here I loved the customer service and the breakfast there after I came back from a night of partying was delicious. Thank you :0)</p><br>Great gateway accomodation<p>I've never written a review about a chain hotel before because they are pretty much the same. This Holiday inn experience was exceptional because it was not only the perfect place to stay when heading North to Bryce Canyon from the Vegas airport, it was so clean it looked new, it was a block away from a general purpose store where we could purchase a cooler-etc for our road trip--but best of all the breakfast was above and beyond what is expected. Pancakes, real eggs of various types, bacon and many healthy options available. Even the gift bag for priority club members was much more generous than usual. Real soap, shampoo bottles and a shower cap! No industrialized shower soap dispensers. Desaun checked us in with enthusiasm, even at the late hour that we arrived. An A+ Holiday Inn.</p><br>Good place if want to be away for business<p>Way off strip, north of vegas. Near nellis air base. Planes ,not a problem. Somewhat sketchy side of town, but felt secure. Hotel is newer. Clean rooms. Friendly staff. I was in town for business.
Only complaint, the levels between the rooms are not too sound proof. Had someone walking hard from 11pm to 1am. Then started back up at 4am( it was only one night). Other then that, had nice stay.
Room Tip: If lite sleeper, get top floor. You will appreciate it.

Only a few minutes away. Quiet, comfortable, and very friendly staff!
Stayed in room 207, checked out on 12/5/2011</p><br>Great location if your going to the race track!<p>The area is not the greatest and it's not the strip but it is convienent for the race track or Nellis Airforce base.
We went to the airshow and stayed for 1 night. The bed was comfy, the room was clean and they offered a great breakast for one low rate.
The staff was very friendly and I was given a gift bag upon arrival with a bottle water, sample of shampoos and conditioners, hand cream and a snack bar.
I would go back!</p><br>A pleasant surprise<p>Since we were arriving in Las Vegas in the early evening, we knew it would be too late to drive to Springdale Utah. Because of the TA reviews we choose this HIE. It was farther from LV than I expected and I wasn't sure of the area since we arrived fairly late - after enjoying a great dinner in LV. The surprise began with a warm welcome and continued when we went to our room. The rooms are updated and are quite nice; very clean and quiet. The breakfast was good. When we left in the morning I was surprised to see the Air Force Base and how easy it was to be drive to highway 15 to drive north to Utah.</p><br>unprecedented service &amp; very nice rooms !<p>Our company had a last minute booking to go to Las Vegas with 30 motorcoach's to begin service for a convention . The hotel staff went to extremes to make our stay a delight !The breakfast that normally starts early in the a.m. was'nt early enough for our drivers but they arranged for a very early breakfast at 5am ! In addition to that all of our drivers said that the rooms were very nice with refridgerators/mics. Easy trip to Strip ! This is an exceptional place, with excellent staff! We will go back!</p><br>nice hotel<p>We stopped there on our way from Utah to Cali. The hotel was very nice, room clean, spacious and breakfast pretty good. Staff very helpful and friendly.</p><br>Great place, excellent staff<p>Happen to be going cross-country and was on the tail end of a 12 hour day of driving when I asked my wife to direct me in to this HI Express (disclaimer: she had enough points for a free night.) Ran into a couple who were based at Nellis and they strongly urged me to relocate for the night due to the proximity to some sketchy neighborhoods. Great.

I chose to stay anyway and all I can say is the place was spotless. The gal working the front desk was great. And I slept like a baby: comfortable bed, clean room with excellent HVAC, clean bathroom, quiet.

Breakfast was the only thing I took one dot off for because the food was not kept at the proper temps (I paid for that a couple hours later, I assure you...ahem - can you say emergency stop at a Burger King in Barstow?) Otherwise, excellent!
Room Tip: I happened to get a room at the end of a hallway far away from the elevator, ice, and vending...so p...
