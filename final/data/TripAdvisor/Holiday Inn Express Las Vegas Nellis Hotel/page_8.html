<html><head><h3>Holiday Inn Express Las Vegas Nellis Hotel Reviews Page 8</h3></head><body><br>Nothing Near By<p>During CES 2013 I stayed at this location. This is my 4th trip to Las Vegas but I have never been to North Las Vegas before. I expected the hotel to be closer than it is. The hotel is quiet and away from all the Vegas activities. You can truly get some rest after a hectic show day. Their room, bed, pillow, bath conditions are as usual, clean, tidy, comfortable and just as I like it. I love the complimentary breakfast. It's not a feast but they have all you need to get your day started. There's a whirlpool or spa and a small swimming pool. I took my time relaxing my legs in the spa after few laps swim. I was surprised with a Air Force Show during our stay. Even though the jets flied by closely, I barely heard the jet noise.
Due to the distance to the strip, I don't recommend this hotel for anyone looking for Las Vegas action. However it is a good option if you are someone like me who like it quiet and calm after a day of work.
Note: I drove from the hotel to Circus Circus (about 15 minutes drive). Left my car in the free parking and took the free CES bus to the convention center. This is to save the $20 / day parking fee.
Room Tip: It's about 15 minutes drive to the strip.

This time I went with my family and we had a very relaxing good night sleep. Thank you for the good service from all of the staff.</p><br>Reasonable accommodations, breakfast a little "shy"<p>The Holiday Inn is very basic, with a small pool (I did not use), friendly and helpful staff, decent sized rooms with comfortable beds and clean bathrooms (sink inside bath area), and coffeebar in room. The breakfast offered limited choices with hot items not as hot as they should have been.</p><br>Comfortable and Clean<p>The room we stayed in was clean and the beds were comfortable. The front desk staff was friendly. The breakfast was nice but the first morning the bananas out were over ripe and the second morning there wasn't any fruit. The breakfast needs fruit for those that are not big egg/sausage/gravy eaters this made the difference between a 3 and 5 rating. Another disappointment was the pool was quite chilly and did not have sun on it for the majority of the day hours. Could have dealt with no sun if the pool was warmer.The lobby smelled like an ash tray even though I did not see anyone smoking in the lobby or that they allowed smoking in the lobby but that is what it smelled like. I like that it is off the strip but a reasonable drive to it if you want to go.</p><br>Nice place to land.<p>This was a halfway point btw SanDiego and the Grand Canyon - we arrived at 1am, after a 7hr TGIF night drive. It was very comfortable and seems consistent with our recent Holiday Inn Express experiences. This chain has earned a recent reputation for basic comfort and predictability.

The front desk was friendly with a little gift ready. The room looked and smelled clean, no smoking coverups and was very tasteful. We enjoyed a good night's sleep with many pillows for our weary bodies...ready for hiking the next day.

The free breakfast was also typical - eggs, sausage, a variety of breads, yogurts, cereals and aromatic fresh coffee. It had the classic pancake machine as well. The staff was very pleasant and helpful at 7am. Very predictable - which is comforting on road trips.

We met a man in the elevator who said that it was a really good place as long as you didn't have to walk the neighborhood. Judging by the landscape in the morning and location - he might have a point. It mostly services the military base and the road weary.

We didn't use the pool, business center or gym - but they looked inviting.

It has my vote for a drive through. We were ready for the road.</p><br>Great hotel and great rate<p>This hotel was very clean and the room, bed, and bathroom were sparkling clean. There were only two things that could have been improved on. First, all hotels should have automatic doors to make getting into the hotel with roll aboards and this one did not. Second, checking out should be made easier by having the bill complete and slid under the room door and not making me have to wait at the desk for someone to close out the bill.</p><br>Okay for an overnight stay.<p>We stayed one night at this Holiday Inn Express, but were disappointed after staying at a beautiful Holiday Inn Express in Orem, Utah just a couple days prior. We were returning from a long road trip to Yellowstone NP. The hotel lobby and staff were pleasant. Upon entering our room there was obvious fragrance of room deodorizer! The room and bathroom were clean and the bed was comfortable ... not sure why it required the room deodorizer. The hotel is in a rather remote area which is not convenient to restaurants. Breakfast was the usual fare with scrambled eggs, sausage, juice, coffee, breads, and yogurt. If you are just looking for an overnight stay away from the busy Las Vegas strip - this will work. This hotel is also pet friendly if you are traveling with a pet.</p><br>Road Trip to California<p>Very nice hotel hidden away from all the lights and action. We choose to stay in Holiday Inn Expresses while traveling to California. Wise choice. The room was exceptional! I check for bed bugs everywhere I go, I don't care how expensive the hotel is, I am not going to bring those things home! Anyway! nice and clean room, no bed bugs! and a nice comfortable mattress. Hotel personnel was very professional and courteous! Breakfast was hot and fresh! Thank you for making my trip to California a pleasant one!</p><br>Cheap place to stay off the strip<p>This hotel was very nice but also very average. The rooms were very clean and included a fridge which is always a must. The staff was very friendly, however when our room was cleaned one day they took all of our old towels and didn't put any new ones in. Because we wanted to shower ASAP we simply walked down to the front desk to ask for the new towels and we were told that she was going to bring them to our room. We waited over an hour, and then decided to call down to the desk and ask politely when we would be receiving them. The person who answered the phone was slightly rude and said that she was busy and would be bringing them soon... so we had to wait even longer.

Other than that we had no other real problems with the hotel itself, they do allow pets and our Pug puppy was safe when we returned each day. Also, we were here for New Year's Eve, the hotel is right off the freeway so any other day we made it down to the strip quickly. However not wanting to drive drunk we called a taxi for this night, and the traffic was so bad and backed up on the freeway that it ended up taking us over an hour to get there and costing us over $150 to go and come back. This year when we go we will be staying closer to the strip to avoid this hassle.</p><br>A Good Night's Sleep!<p>Not a beautiful location, but right next to Nellis. The hotel was exceptionally clean and comfortable with excellent beds and bedding. The staff was knowledgeable and courteous. Our only complaint: the towels were a little little....</p><br></body></html>
